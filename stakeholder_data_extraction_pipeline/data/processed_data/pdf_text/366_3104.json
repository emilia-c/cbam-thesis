Extend the antenna to its full height. For frequencies higher than 400 MHz, shortening the antenna may improve the reception.\n3\nUse the desktop stand (fold out from bottom of unit) for a better viewing and operating angle. Helpful Hints\ne If strong interference or electrical noise is received, relocate the scanner or its antenna away from the source. If you are operating the scanner in a fringe area or need to improve reception, use an optional antenna designed for multi-band coverage. (You can purchase this type of antenna at a local electronics store.) If the optional antenna has no cable, use 50-70 ohm coaxial cable for lead-in. A mating plug may be necessary for the optional antennas.\n|\n14\n| | UB367ZV_UBC355CLT_1208.indd 14\n—____\n—_—__\n2011/12/08 19:55:57 | |",
  "page_15": "] Select a location in your vehicle to mount the UBC355CLT unit. Avoid any locations that could interfere with your driving. In a passenger car, the ideal location is underneath the dashboard on the passenger side.\n|\n®\nWarning: Do not use the Vehicle Power Adapter ina\npositive ground vehicle.\nPlug one end of the Vehicle Power Adapter into the vehicle’s accessory power jack and the other end into the DC 13.8V jack on the back of the scanner. Connect the mobile antenna plug into the ANT connector on the rear panel. For more information on antenna installation, please refer to the instruction guide that came with your mobile antenna.\nPermanent Mobile Installation\nPermanently installing the UBC355CLT scanner into a vehicle involves two main steps - physically installing the scanner and physically connecting the power supply. It does not matter which is installed first; perform these procedures in an order that is most appropriate for your vehicle’s configuration.\nPermanently Mounting the UBC355CLT Unit\n&\n|\n15\n—_—__\n| | UB367ZV_UBC355CLT_1208.indd 15\n—____\n| |\n2011/12/08 19:55:57",

Note: If there are screws already holding the dashboard, you may be able to use the same screw holes to mount the bracket. Drill the necessary holes and secure the mounting bracket in place using the screws provided. CAUTION: Do not drill into air bags. Do not drill if what is behind the dashboard is unknown. Mount the scanner to the bracket only after the wiring has been connected to the rear panel.\nPermanently Connecting the Mobile Power Supply\nCAUTION: If you are not experienced in connecting accessories to the vehicle fuse box, please see your automotive dealer for advice on proper installation.\nCheck the vehicle battery connections to determine which battery terminal (positive or negative) is grounded to the engine block or chassis. Most of today’s vehicles use a negative ground. If your vehicle has a negative ground, follow Steps 2 and 3. Otherwise, skip to the Caution in Step 3.\n|\n—_—__\n16\n| | UB367ZV_UBC355CLT_1208.indd 16\n2011/12/08 19:55:57 | |\n—____",

All activated banks plus their “private” channels are scanned. Press other bank keys to add banks to scan.\nThe Bank label/icon for the scanned frequency flashes while that bank is scanned. When an active frequency is found, the scanner stops on that frequency. When transmission ends, the scanner pauses 2 seconds for a new transmission. If no new transmission is found, scanning resumes.
