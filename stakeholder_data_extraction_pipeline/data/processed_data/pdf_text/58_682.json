SUSTAINABILITY\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\nLETTER\nFROM THE CHAIRMAN\nFABRIZIO DI AMATO\nChairman and\nMajority Shareholder\nMAIRE\nDear Stakeholders,\nflection within our Group. To respond to the demands of an unprecedented historical and industrial moment, we asked ourselves how we could best position ourselves to seize the oppor- tunities presented by the system and ensure the creation of long-term value for shareholders and all stakeholders.\n2022 was a year of sudden change for the entire world.\nThe tense international political climate on a large scale created progressive waves that primarily impacted the energy and commodity markets at all levels. This can be considered a his- toric turning point and an opportunity for broad reflection on accelerating a change of pace towards a cleaner and safer energy system. The changes that have emerged in recent months and are still taking place will most likely not be temporary but will have long-term effects, progressively aligning industri- al and economic goals with climate and social goals. In this still-evolving envi- ronment, our Group began four years ago to adapt its business model to re- spond to pressures that were already evident, but which have accelerated and become more urgent over the past year. Broad and structural phenome- na such as the growth of the world’s population, rising temperatures, the need for a different energy mix and the increasing demand for plastics linked to the growth of emerging economies have necessarily required in-depth re-\nFrom this reflection, the new structure of our Group was conceived in 2022, which in 2023 will take shape as an industrial player that responds with a broad and diversified technological offer to the demand for sustainable industrial solutions, in line with a reg- ulatory and commercial system that increasingly rewards low-carbon choic- es, providing its management capacity and consolidated technical know-how necessary for their realisation.\nTo do this, and to support a new way of being a business partner in the long term, we need to face some challeng- es and bring on board dynamic sup- ply chains and professionals who are increasingly ready to offer innovative solutions in ever-changing scenarios.\nThis is the direction of our sustain- ability strategy, focusing on climate\n=\n—_ ins\nfa\n=\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\nAn industrial player that\nresponds with a broad\nand diversified technological\noffer to the demand\nfor sustainable\nindustrial solutions.\nchange, but also on the betterment of people, using innovation as a catalyst for well-being, and involving regions and communities in long-term devel- opment. Our aim is to involve the new generations who will be the leaders of the future and who are particularly aware of the shared values of environ- mental sustainability, merit and respect for diversity.\nOnly a multidimensional approach can guarantee us sustainable growth and the ability to see new opportunities in the challenges that the international context presents.\n— ae C aeety\nt —\n=\n4 CREATING VALUE\n2.

INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\nLETTER FROM THE CEO\na\nALESSANDRO BERNINI\nChief Executive\nOfficer\nMAIRE\nDear Stakeholders,\nThe transition in 2022 had another meaning for me, of change, yes, but also of great challenge.\nSince taking the helm of the Group in May, navigation has been complex, giv- en the high level of geopolitical insta- bility in key geographical areas of op- eration. A reorientation towards more stable geographies, with which the Group has already had a long-stand- ing relationship, has facilitated a healthy continuation of business in the Group’s traditional areas, but also, and increasingly, in the area of new green solutions. The steady flow of new con- tracts, new agreements with high-pro- file partners and recent acquisitions, as well as an organisational structure that has reactively absorbed interna- tional shocks, have been fundamental supports for the business to continue as usual despite the significant chang- es at the beginning of the year. Once again, the flexible industrial model that characterises our Group has shown that the focus on economic results and value creation is the beacon to guide us in the changing context of recent months.\n5. VALUE FOR TERRITORIES\nAPPENDIX\nAND COMMUNITIES\nA sustainability strategy that is not just about today’s business, but about opening up new avenues for future development.\nsentation in our supply chain, focusing not only on environmental performance but also on respect for human rights. Once again, people are the engine of our business in the areas where we operate, and we invest in their poten- tial by launching In-Country Value pro- grammes and community development initiatives aimed at training local profes- sionals in the energy transition. This is supported by a network of relationships with universities and innovation players who provide us with an open view of new perspectives on sustainability.\n2022 has shown us that the world is changing at an ever-increasing pace at all levels and with a lasting impact on many fronts, not just business. But it has also taught us that the ability to anticipate change and seize opportu- nities is the only way to respond to the market in a timely manner and create long-term value. This is the premise behind the new look that our Group is adopting in order to act as a preferred partner in the field of technologies for the energy transition, without losing its role as a reliable manager of large, complex industrial projects.\nThe performance in 2022 is proof of this: Revenues €3.46 billion, Backlog €8.61 billion.\nBehind these numbers, however, there are also others, and a_sustainabili- ty strategy that is not just about to- day’s business, but about opening up new avenues for future development: the Group’s green acceleration now launched, a segment of enabling tech- nologies for the energy transition and the circular economy with an order in- take of €800 million, a decarbonisation plan aligned with the business plan un- til 2032. We have set carbon neutrality targets for 2030 (Scope 1 and 2) and 2050 (Scope 8) and set up a dedicat- ed task force with 4 vertical working groups on the different emission sourc- es, focusing on actions to reduce them and actively involving the supply chain. We are closely monitoring the develop- ment of the European Taxonomy and have made a concerted effort over the past year to fully understand its impact on our business.\nBut we also have a broad focus on people in their corporate dimension, with particular attention to diversity and health and safety, and their repre-",

INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\nPARTNERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP\nMany sustainability challenges cross geo- graphical and industry boundaries and require systemic changes beyond the capabilities of individual companies or even a specific industry. The establish- ment of detailed partnerships as well as associative participation aim to put expe- rience and knowledge at the service of companies and organisations that share a common path of sustainability and re- sponsibility. By joining a range of organ- isations and initiatives we can facilitate collaboration, increase our impact, learn and together accelerate positive change. Partnerships and memberships with na- tional and international organisations are of strategic importance to our compa- ny. The interaction resulting from these collaborations has a significant impact on the success of our efforts towards achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda.

  "page_13": "APPENDIX\nIn an international context, the Euro- pean Union has, for some time, very much taken on the leading role on en- ergy transition and the path towards decarbonisation. The European Green Deal (2019) and the European Climate Law (2021) commits Europe to a 55% reduction in climate-altering emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, with substantial reforms initiat- ed to meet these targets. On 14 July 2021, the Commission published the Fit for 55 package, consisting of 13 regulatory proposals designed to re- configure entire existing governance areas and legally create new ones, thereby giving the impetus required to the process of decarbonisation and the energy transition. During 2022, the various legislative proposals were examined by the European Parliament and the European Council. However, in almost all cases, a final text was not\n1.

In the coming years we will increase our direct commitment to researching and developing inno- vative and sustainable technological solutions for industry, including via pro- prietary patents and acquisitions. Sim- ilarly, as we continue to interact with the external innovation ecosystem, we will also interface with it in new ways. The Maire Tecnimont Group champions a new sustainable paradigm along the entire value chain, from suppliers - with whom it interacts through an ESG lens and involves in social assessments and environmental goals - through to the lo- cal areas in which it operates. Through its In Country Value programmes and corporate social responsibility activ- ities, the Group creates growing eco- nomic and social value for local areas and communities. The Maire Tecnimont Group’s Foundation plays an active role in training school and university stu- dents and disseminating issues related to the idea of “humanist engineering”. As such, the Group is increasingly able to take the lead in creating the profes- sionals required for the energy transi- tion and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Group’s sustainability strategy is of fundamental importance to its value system - in both ethical and financial terms. In turn, this drives our develop- ment of a common vision which is (and must increasingly be) our activity’s im- print, in every segment of the business and in every area we operate in.\nWe integrate ESG issues into our indus- trial strategy and direct our people’s actions towards achieving goals relat- ed to these issues; this is reinforced by our flourishing, training, Safethink, and diversity, equity and inclusion pro- grammes. Our new materiality vision, using an impact assessment based on the most recent guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative and carried out with significant engagement from employees and external stakeholders, helps us to increasingly focus sustain- ability initiatives on results; from 2023 onwards, these will be aligned to the following priority targets.\nENERGY TRANSITION AS A WORLD MEGA-PROJECT SUPPORTED BY MASSIVE FUNDINGS\no..\nENERGY TRANSITION a\n\\\nJUST TRANSITION\n>2 tn EU\nFUND\nnon\n@ NATIONAL\nCHINA\nINTRODUCTION\nSOCIAL CLIMATE FUND\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 23\n3.

As such, they can be valuable in understanding not only expected economic growth paths, but geopolitical dynamics too.\nIn recent times, the energy transition has become more than simply a globally pursued aim - it is now also a favoured sector for public and private invest- ment. It is no exaggeration to say that in the coming years economic competi- tion will be followed most closely in the areas of sustainable energy markets and raw material circularity.\nThe Paris Agreement (2015) -— which committed to preventing global tem- peratures from rising by more than 2°C and to making every effort to restrict any increase to 1.5°C relative to pre-in- dustrial levels - was confirmed at the G20 Energy and Climate joint session (2021); COP26 in Glasgow (2021) went further, making 1.5 °C the binding limit for global warming and no longer simply a target.\nImprove our carbon footprint,\ncommitting fully to achieving\ncarbon neutrality for scope\n1 & 2 emissions by 2030\nthrough initiatives involving\noffices and construction sites.\nImprove our impact as enablers of the energy transition by expanding our portfolio of solutions for decarbonisation, circularity and environmental impact reduction.\nImprove our transformative impact on our HSE-driven human capital, which is richly diverse, multicultural and a driver of change, through flourishing and intensive training programmes.\nImprove our impact on innovation by expanding our range of patents, proprietary technologies and digital solutions, in collaboration with the innovation ecosystem.\neconomic and social impact and shared value on communities in geographical areas through a sustainable supply chain, ICV, CSR and the activities of our Foundation.\nEnhance the impact of our transformative power by sharing the vision of our sustainability strategy within the Group in every business, project, region and upply chain.\nImprove our positive\n22 CREATING VALUE\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n=\nIn the past few years, Maire Tecnimont has developed its sustainability strat- egy across five areas - Environment, People, Innovation, Community and Governance. In 2022, it made signifi- cant progress towards the main goals in its ESG path. Maire Tecnimont’s in- tention was to adopt a forward-looking approach in its strategies and sought to identify the trends and requirements of the decarbonisation process and the Sustainable Development Goals. This approach means that the Group is improving its carbon footprint while also making a positive contribution to the supply chain. It does this by acting as an enabler for clients through devel- oping low and zero carbon or circular technological solutions for the pro- duction of intermediates and chemical products; and by stimulating suppliers through boosting their ESG classifica- tion and alignment with its carbon neu- trality objectives.\nGOVERNMENT FUND\n2030 The Maire Tecn- imont Group is committed to im- first carbon proving its emis- neutrality sions performance plan through a dedicat- ed task force re- sponsible for achieving carbon neutrality goals; it also reports on how its activities fit and align with the EU Taxonomy, in- cluding via the development of Life Cycle Assessment studies. In setting emission reduction targets, we are guided by a medium and long-term vision, and this year, for the first time, we have estab- lished a decarbonisation plan through to 2030. We believe that the significant in- vestment required - in both human and financial resources - strengthens our competitiveness and reputation.\nBy directly committing to research and development into sustainable techno- logical solutions, project development, engineering design and industrial plant infrastructures that prioritise minimis- ing environmental and emission im- pacts, the Maire Tecnimont Group acts as an enabler and integrator of innova- tion for the energy transition and the",

All measures to re- duce greenhouse gas emissions belong to the first strand, such as the ETS (Emission Trading System) regulation which raises the CO, reduction target to the equivalent of 61% compared to 2005 levels (against the current target of 40%), and extends its scope to new sectors (road transport, shipping, air transport, construction); ESR (Effort Sharting) legislation, which sets out a target of reducing climate-chang- ing emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels by 2080 in sectors not covered by the ETS; the regulation on the CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) which introduces a car- bon price at borders to mitigate carbon leakage in ETS sectors; the New EU Forest Strategy for 2030, concerning reforestation as a natural offsetting tool for emissions; the revision of the “LULUCF” legislation on removals re- sulting from land use, land use change and forestry; the CO, auto proposal on emission limits for road transport ve- hicles, which bans the sale of vehicles with combustion engines from 2035.\nThe second strand includes, firstly, measures aimed at ensuring the grad- ual replacement of fossil fuels with re- newables in the European energy mix. In this sense, RED3 plays a strategic role, with a 40% increase of the renewable energy target on gross final energy con- sumption by 2030 and the progressive expansion of the quantity of synthetic fuels (RCF and RFNBOs) used to re- place fossils, together with biofuels. In addition to RED3, there are certain sec- tor-specific provisions concerning fuels used for specific modes of transport: the legislation on aviation fuels (ReFuel Aviation EU) and the legislation on ship- ping fuels (FuelEU Maritime).\nThe circular economy package is sec-\nondary to Fit for 55. It includes legis-\ndesigned to protect European industri- al competitiveness from the distorting effects of the potentially protectionist subsidies and measures adopted by other countries - in particular by the USA (Inflation Reduction Act), Japan and India (Production Linked Incentive Scheme). Its aim is to boost European autonomy in the supply of raw mate- rials by developing a European market for secondary raw materials (to this end, the adoption of a Critical Raw Materials Act was announced); and support European industry by making state aid rules more flexible, simplifying and speeding up authorisation proce- dures and adopting economic support measures, such as the establishment of a European Sovereign Fund.\n\nii Recent Italian leg- islation derives partly from the internal transpo- sition of European legal sources, and partly from the implementation of the reforms in the Italian NRRP; the Com- mission has made the latter a condi- tion of the Next Generation EU funds being released to Italy. With reference to the NRRP, in 2022 Italy’s Ministry of the Environment adopted a series of strategic planning acts, including the Plan for the Ecological Transi- tion (CITE Resolution of 8/3/2022), the National Strategy for the Circular Economy (Ministerial Decree no. 259 of 24/6/2022) and the National Pro- gramme for Waste Management (Min- isterial decree no. 257 of 24/6/2022). There have also been numerous mea- sures connected to the governance of the NRRP that have introduced proce- dural simplifications and brought for- ward completion deadlines, especially those for authorising strategic plant installations for achieving the energy transition goals.\nAs a result of the RePower EU pri- orities - in particular containing gas demand and consumption in view of the interruption of supplies from Rus-\nINTRODUCTION\n1. SUSTAINABILITY\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\nlative initiatives concerning the correct management of resources and materi- als throughout their lifespan, starting with the correct design of products (ecodesign regulation) and the sus- tainability requirements of materials, through to correct waste management to facilitate the reintroduction of recy- cled materials into production or con- sumption cycles. Some guidelines also refer to specific material flows, with the aim of introducing targeted measures for the correct management of the waste in question and the creation of mono-material circular flows, as in the case of plastics and textile fibres.\n\nIn the past three years, the global pan- demic, the energy price crisis and the conflict in Ukraine have caused deep uncertainty, including within the Union; despite this, the energy transition pro- cess has not been thrown off course or delayed. On the contrary, there has been a further strong push towards decarbonisation in order to secure and strengthen energy security and auton- omy in Europe and reduce dependence on materials from third countries.\nTo help the European economy re- bound from the pandemic, the Next Generation EU package has made 750 billion euros available to states, including 672.5 billion euros under its Recovery and Resilience Facility, in- tended to support reforms and invest- ments in strategic sectors and stimu- late the energy and digital transition of countries within the Union. These resources have been allocated to in- dividual states for the implementation of reforms and investments set out in national NRRPs (National Recovery and Resilience Plans).\nIn 2022 further measures were intro- duced, in the form of legal and financial measures aimed at dealing with the consequences of the war in Ukraine and the interruption of economic and trade relations with Russia.\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nRePower EU is a package of regula- tory measures, adopted by the Com- mission on 18 May 2022, to provide even greater impetus to the process of decarbonisation and energy transi- tion, with the aim of decoupling Europe from its dependence on fossil fuels imported from Russia by bringing for- ward several decarbonisation targets. This strategy is based on three pillars: “save 17 66 diversify energy , energy sourc- me es, accelerate the energy transition”. For each pillar, new actions for reform are envisaged, raising yet further the already ambitious targets set by the Green Deal and thereby intervening on the goals laid out in the Fit for 55 pro- posals even before their final approval.\nIndeed, RePower EU has a 2080 tar- get of reducing final energy consump- tion by 13% compared to 2020 (versus the -9% envisaged by Fit for 55), a renewable energy target on gross final energy consumption of 45% by 2030 (versus the 40% envisaged by Fit for 55), with a sub-target for the trans- port sector of +32% by 2080 (versus the +28% envisaged by Fit for 55). The focus on renewable hydrogen is highly significant; 2030 targets for this en- ergy source have doubled to +20 mil- lion tonnes (10 million imported and 10 million produced domestically), with a consequent new electrolysis capacity of 65+ MW and 500+ TWh of additive power for renewable generation.\nThis change to the regulatory backdrop has also seen the introduction of new economic measures aimed at support- ing states achieve what is expected of them. Additional resources are allocat- ed to states on the basis of changes to the Recovery and Resilience Facility and to individual state NRRPs.\n\nIn early 2023, there was a further development in the European regula- tory framework with the Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age, an act of strategic planning explicitly\n3. OUR PEOPLE AND THE VALUE\nOF HEALTH, SAFETY AND DIVERSITY\nsia - in 2022 the Ministry adopted the National Plan for the Containment of Natural Gas Consumption, with a target of voluntarily reducing gas con- sumption by 15%. In parallel to this, Italy has also launched a series of ini- tiatives for financing the investments that the NRRP identifies, allocating 59.5 billion euros to Mission 2: “Green Revolution and Ecological Transition”. Of particular interest were the circular economy measures, which saw Maire Tecnimont’s participation with the nomination of three projects (two in the Plastic Hubs segment, one of which was through its subsidiary Maireplast Industries Srl, and the third in the Tex- tile Hubs segment); these were all con- sidered eligible and placed in the list, albeit with only one well placed to ben- efit from funding, with an allocation of around 8 million euros.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. government passed the Inflation Re- duction Act (IRA), a 740 billion dollar, ten-year plan contain- ing measures to curb inflation, invest in more sustainable energy policies, in- crease health coverage and raise tax- es on large corporate profits. The act’s measures for the energy sector are aimed at addressing the climate crisis, promoting environmental justice and supporting the US manufacturing and industrial sectors in order to push the country to the forefront of the clean energy sectors, as well as reducing emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2030 and securing climate neutrality by 2050.\nThe act has the virtue of incorporat- ing long-term strategic planning; this is particularly complex because, in addi- tion to introducing new support mea- sures in strategic sectors, it intervenes in pre-existing tax regulations and programmes, supplementing them and modifying their scope.\n4. INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\n24 CREATING VALUE\n5. VALUE FOR TERRITORIES\nAND COMMUNITIES\nAPPENDIX\nThe IRA provides investments in cli- mate protection and clean energy production, as well as tax credits for households to offset energy costs and reduce carbon emissions.\nNearly 370 billion dollars have been al- located to decades-long investments in strategic clean energy sectors; 60 billion dollars are earmarked for environmental justice initiatives: about 15 billion dollars are for emission reduction and clean energy projects in low-income commu- nities; around 2.25 billion dollars are aimed at reducing air pollution in ports.\nAbout 11.7 billion dollars are going to- wards increasing the existing Loan Pro- grammes Office (LPO); this scheme sup- ports new loans in addition to the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) pro- gramme and relates to loans for invest- ments in the renewal, upgrading, con- version and efficiency of existing energy plants and infrastructures. The law also expands the number of loans that can be granted under the Advanced Tech- nology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Direct Loan Programme, for advanced technology vehicles and components. Finally, the IRA has also increased the total amount of loans available at any given time under the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program (TELGP) from 2 bil- lion to 20 billion dollars.\nIn terms of tax credits, around 30 billion dollars are planned for the production of solar panels, wind turbines, critical minerals and batteries; about 10 billion dollars for the construction of renewable energy plants and electric vehicles; ap- proximately 9 billion dollars will be allo- cated to energy efficiency measures for residential buildings. A 27 billion dollar clean energy loan fund has been estab- lished for renewable energy and reclama- tion projects in low-income areas. Exist- ing regulations have also been amended with the introduction or increase of tax credits for carbon capture technologies, for the production of hydrogen or nuclear energy and for the production of biofuels or alternative fuels.\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 25",

Corporate strategies and performance indicators must therefore take into account a long-term vision and a values system built on the as- sumption that growth cannot be de- coupled from sustainability.\nIn response to this, an increasing num- ber of companies are taking a new course of action that places environ- mental impact at the core of their pri- orities and are aligning their strategies with energy transition goals.\nDecarbonisation is one of the major and most pressing pillars underpinning the commitments announced. This is because, if the current trend of GHG emissions does not change, the con- centration of CO, in the atmosphere is likely to see a 50% increase by 2050, leading to even greater environmental consequences than those we are al- ready witnessing. The ambitious decar- bonisation target set out in net-zero scenarios by 2050 requires significant capital investment (in the order of 1.5- 3.5 trillion dollars per year) and helps develop more resilient economic mod- els, in both developed and emerging economies, thanks to a reduction in fossil fuel dependence.\n16\nOECD 14\n'EU\nChina\n12\n10\nIndia\n1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050\nSource 2022 Energy Outlook (Equinor “Walls” scenario).\nje\nglobal food security\nCX\na)\nindustry decarbonization\n=)\nnew energy carriers\non\nsustainable materials\n\nCURRENT TRAJECTORY 4.0°C\nPARIS PLEDGES !\nPATH!\n2.0°C\n1.5°C PATH\n2030\n2040\n4.

The other four objectives still need to be regulated; this includes for the circular economy, where the Maire Tecnimont Group is making significant investments. It is therefore reasonable to expect that as the regulatory framework for the circular economy develops, the eligi- bility of the Group’s activities will be extended to the waste chemistry sec- tors. In any event, activities related to waste recycling plants have been in- cluded among those taxonomically eli- gible, as they correspond to a specific cluster in the existing regulation.\nimportance of human rights and la- bour standards. Finally, in relation to each eligible and permissible activity, the Regulation requires companies to report turn- over, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx).\nTaxonomy\ncontext\nThe EU Taxonomy of eco-sustainable economic activities is one of the ini- tiatives promoted by the European Commission to achieve the goals of the European Green Deal and its zero-im- pact objective by 2050. To this end, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the “Reg- ulation”) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 22 June 2020 - and entered into force on 12 July 2020. The Regulation sets out a classification system for defining which economic activities can be con- sidered eco-sustainable, influencing market dynamics and guiding investors towards sustainable initiatives.\nIn order to embed a corporate culture that is aligned to the Taxonomy’s reg- ulatory framework, during 2022 the Maire Tecnimont Group created a per- manent task force consisting of over 70 people from both corporate func- tions and its main subsidiaries, as well as carrying out various activities in- cluding: internal refresher courses pro- vided to each applicable company, with the aim of standardising the approach to the Regulation; meetings with Group divisions and internal functions, aimed at obtaining specific information on the activities and projects carried out; formalisation of an internal Group pro- cedure, with the aim of overseeing a process for the timely and effective collection of data and documents.\nAt the methodological level, an entity can classify its economic activities as eco-sustainable under the Taxonomy only if they coincide with the descrip- tion of one of the economic activities listed in the Delegated Regulation on the Climate (in which case we speak of eligibility), as well as complying with the relevant technical criteria. Only if these criteria are met can an economic ac- tivity be classified as eco-sustainable under the Taxonomy - i.e. as aligned. Specifically, for the purposes of align- ment, an activity must: +> comply with the criteria of substan- tially contributing to one of the en- vironmental objectives; comply with the criteria of not caus- ing significant harm (DNSH), i.e. not generating adverse effects on the other environmental objectives to which the economic activity does not substantially contribute; comply with the Minimal Social (MSS), the\nOn the basis of art. 9 of the Regula- tion, these specific economic activities refer to the following six environmental objectives: > climate change mitigation; > adaptation to climate change; > sustainable use and protection of waters and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; prevention and reduction of pollu- tion; protection and restoration of biodi- versity and ecosystems.\nMaire Tecnimont’s activity in relation to the Taxonomy\nFollowing the formal adoption of arti- cle 3 of the Regulation, for the 2022 reporting year, eligibility and alignment with the Taxonomy will be considered with reference to the first two envi- ronmental objectives formally adopted\nThere follows some useful background on the results of the Group’s analyses to identify which of its economic activities are eco-sustainable under the Taxonomy. The current regulatory framework fo- cuses mainly on CO,-intensive sectors\nSafeguards recognising\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 29\n28 CREATING VALUE\ning trend for this to be eligible for Tax- onomy criteria. Finally, in terms of the current legislative framework, the Group has achieved significant results for the activities of its Sustainable Technology Solutions BU, as this sector is specifi- cally aimed at developing solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation. In particular, the activities related to urea ultra-low energy technology, mechani- cal recycling and plastic upcycling are worthy of mention. Finally, in the green chemistry sector, the Maire Tecnimont Group can play a leading role in guid- ing the technological choices and the basic configuration of the plant, in line with the objectives of the EU Taxonomy. In FY22, despite the results described above, the revenues of the Sustainable Technology Solutions BU were still lower than those of the Integrated E&C solu- tions BU, while the 2023-2032 Busi- ness Plan envisages a balancing in the medium term. Given the very different nature of the business units in terms of the activities they carry out (the major- ity of revenues for the Integrated E&C Solutions business unit derive from gas monetisation and petrochemicals, while most of the revenues for the Sustain- able Technology Solutions business unit relate to energy transition activities), we believe that a consolidated analysis of the data would lead to an incorrect interpretation of the degree of eligibili- ty and alignment of Maire Tecnimont Group revenues.

VALUE FOR TERRITORIES\nAND COMMUNITIES\nand economic activities that could en- able mitigation and the adaptation of other sectors. Within this, there is only marginal scope for the activities of an EPC general contractor in a tradition- al sector, i.e. the one in which the In- tegrated E&C Solutions BU typically operates. It therefore follows that only a part of the plant design and con- struction activities carried out by the Maire Tecnimont Group is recognised by the Taxonomy as making a sub- stantial contribution to climate change mitigation. In contrast, the current tax- onomic regulatory framework includes within its scope production activities by clients for whom the Group designs plants, which in turn allow production processes with high energy efficiency and limited or no environmental impact to be carried out.\nIn addition, the general contractor can reduce the environmental impacts of the plants as a whole - or of some of their components - to the extent by which such measures are set out by the technical specifications in the con- tractual requirements negotiated with clients. This has an effect on the eli- gibility and alignment process. As the current taxonomic framework only par- tially includes advisory and engineering services related to the Delegating Reg- ulation on the Climate, only a part of the Group’s economic activities are eligible.\nCurrently, only part of the economic ac- tivities related to natural gas fall within the scope of eligible activities. Conse- quently, the gas treatment activities carried out by the Integrated E&C solu- tions BU - i.e. the design and construc- tion of plants for the treatment and transformation of natural gas (gas mon- etisation), which represent an import- ant component of the Maire Tecnimont Group’s revenues - will be eligible only when the legislation extends the scope of the Taxonomy to include these ac- tivities. However, in the context of the economic activities related to the pro- duction of hydrogen on its own techno- logical base, with design, planning and construction activities, there is a grow-",
  "page_17": "=\nAnalysis of the eligibility of the economic activities carried out by the Group\nMaire Tecnimont assessed eligibili- ty through a comprehensive analysis of each turnover-generating project during the year. As a result of this analysis, the Group identified the fol- lowing activities as eligible:\n“Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydro- gen”: the eligible economic activi- ty concerning the manufacture of equipment for a hydrogen (H,) pro- duction plant for biorefining. “Manufacture of other low- carbon technologies”: the eligible economic activity concerning the development of technologies for ultra-low energy consumption and energy-reduction projects (e.g. urea ultra-low energy). “Material recovery from non- hazardous waste”: the eligible eco- nomic activity concerning the con- struction and operation of a plant for the selection and treatment of non-hazardous waste collected sepa- rately (e.g. plastic recycling activities). “Infrastructure for rail trans- port”: the eligible economic activity related to electrified railway infra- structure. “Infrastructure enabling low- carbon water transport”: the eligible economic activity linked to the con- struction of port infrastructure for the water-based transport of con- struction materials. “Close-to-market research, development and innovation”: the eligible economic activity concern- ing the research and development of solutions dedicated to reducing GHG emissions for very low energy consumption and energy reduction projects.\nINTRODUCTION\n1. SUSTAINABILITY\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\nThe eligibility analysis was carried out with reference also to art. 8, § 1.1.2.2, point c of Annex | to Delegated Regu- lation 2021/2178, which allows compa- nies to report the purchase of outputs from economic activities aligned with the Taxonomy and individual measures that allow an economic activity to re- duce GHG or carbon emissions. To this end, the following activities were iden- tified as eligible:\n> (6.5) “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light com- mercial vehicles”: the — eligible economic activity relating to the purchase of the right of use of low-emission vehicles. “Renovation of existing build- ings”: the eligible economic activity linked to the renovation of buildings. “Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating and con- trolling the energy performance of buildings”: the activities of installa- tion, maintenance and repair of in- struments and devices for measur- ing, regulating and controlling the energy performance of buildings. “Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions”: the eligible economic activity related to the de- velopment or use of ICT solutions that are aimed at providing data and analysis enabling GHG emis- sions reductions.\nFollowing the identification of all eco- nomic activities eligible for the Taxon- omy, a further assessment was car- ried out to verify the fulfilment of the technical criteria for alignment. This was done to identify which activities were aligned with the requirements of the Regulation, as well as to deter- mine their relative turnover, CapEx and OpEx percentage. The analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team and involved the collaboration of sev- eral divisions.\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nAnalysis of the alignment of the Maire Tecnimont Group’s economic activities — Criteria for substantial contribution\nThe analysis confirmed that the sub- stantial contribution criteria were met in the case of the following activities:\n“Manufacture of equipment for\nthe production and use of hydro- gen”: the environmental perfor- mance of economic activities was analysed through a multi-divisional assessment that took into account the requirement to reduce GHG emissions during the life cycle, as methodologically provided for by the 14067/2018 standard. The analysis showed that the economic activities complied with the GHG emission thresholds.\n“Manufacture of other low-car- bon technologies”: a comprehensive analysis showed that the economic activities lead to the production of technologies with a substantial reduc- tion - compared to the best perform- ing alternative technologies available on the market — in GHG emissions during the activity’s life cycle “Material recovery from non- hazardous waste”: the economic activity is based on a mechanical recycling technology that allows - as part of production processes - the conversion into secondary raw materials of at least 50% (in terms of weight) of non-hazardous waste treated and collected separately. “Infrastructure for rail trans- port”: the activities contribute sub- stantially to the climate change mit- igation objective in as much as they consist of the construction of elec- trified ground-based infrastructure\n3. OUR PEOPLE AND THE VALUE\nOF HEALTH, SAFETY AND DIVERSITY\nand associated subsystems that\ntransfer passengers to rail transport from other forms of transport. “Infrastructure enabling low- carbon water transport”: the activ- ities consist of building port infra- structure for the transport of con- struction materials by water, with a substantial reduction in CO,. The analysis of the design solution was carried out in line with the national requirements applicable under the Environmental Impact Assessment. “Close-to-market research, de- velopment and innovation”: the economic activities consist of the research and development of technologies related to Taxono- my-aligned activities, which make it possible to meet the technical criteria in question. An LCA (life cy- cle assessment) on potential GHG emissions from new technological solutions showed that they per- form better than the current mar- ket-leading technologies.\nAs regards the purchase of outputs from taxonomy-aligned economic activ- ities and individual measures enabling an economic activity to reduce GHG or carbon emissions, the following activi- ties were identified as being aligned:\n> “Transport motorbikes,\nby pas- senger cars and light commercial vehicles”: from an analysis of avail- able data and documents, vehicles in the company fleet with emissions below the threshold of 50g CO,/km were identified.\n4. INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\nAlignment analysis of the Maire Tecnimont Group’s economic activities — Criteria for Do No Significant Harm\nFurther analysis was carried out on the economic activities that complied with the substantial contribution criteria in order to verify their compliance with the DNSH criteria — and therefore their alignment.\nFor the economic activities related to point 3.2, “Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydro- gen” the DNSH criteria were met. In particular, with regards to the DNSH “Adaptation to climate change” criteri- on, a data-driven analysis was carried out. Specifically, in view of extreme weather data, it did not appear that the performance of the activities could be affected by climate risks. With re- gard to the DNSH objective “Sustain- able use and protection of water and marine resources”, an EIA was carried out, which did not highlight any risk of direct contamination of groundwater. All water effluents and potentially pol- luted water such as first flush rainwa- ter are collected and delivered to the refinery’s wastewater treatment plant. With regard to the objective of “Transi- tion to a circular economy”, measures have been adopted, where available, to extract value from the waste pro- duced in the construction of the plant. In carrying out the economic activities analysed, none of the substances list- ed in Appendix C of Annex | of Dele- gated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 was produced or used; this was confirmed by the hazard and operability study. As regards the potential impacts on biodi- versity and ecosystems, the EIA (which also analysed the measures adopted\n5. VALUE FOR TERRITORIES\nAND COMMUNITIES\nAPPENDIX\nfor the construction and operation of the plant) confirmed that the location of the plant and its immediate sur- roundings were not sensitive areas in terms of biodiversity (including Natura 2000).\nFor the economic activities related to point 3.6, “Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies”, the DNSH criteria that were analysed were met. The climate change risk analysis car- ried out over a 20-year timeframe did not reveal any significant climate risks relevant to the economic activity. With regard to the “Sustainable use and pro- tection of water and marine resourc- es”, an environmental impact assess- ment was conducted in accordance with local and international regulations; the results of this confirmed compli- ance with effluent contamination lim- its. Measures were adopted to prevent water and soil contamination during the construction phase. With reference to the “Transition to a circular econo- my”, a waste management plan based on recycling and reuse principles was adopted for construction. In addition, a pollution prevention and control plan and a plan for managing the storage of hazardous materials were adopted, and periodic HSE checks put in place. According to the environmental impact study, there are no protected areas on the project’s site or its immediate vicin- ity; therefore the DNSH criteria for the protection and restoration of biodiversi- ty and ecosystems - which require the implementation of biodiversity mitiga- tion and compensation measures - are not applicable.\nFor the economic activities related to point 5.9, “Material recovery from non-hazardous waste”, no physical climatic risks relevant to the activity’s life cycle were identified. An Environ- mental Screening Study was conduct- ed, which ruled out the plant’s sub- jection to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure as no el- ements were found that could cause significant negative effects on the environment. The Study assessed that\n30 CREATING VALUE\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 31",

Following specific analyses, neither physical cli- matic risks nor risks of environmental degradation related to the conserva- tion of water quality and the preven- tion of water stress were identified. As regards the transition to a circular economy, measures were taken for the recycling, reuse and recovery of other materials from the waste generated during construction. With regard to pol- lution prevention and control (DNSH), appropriate measures were taken to mitigate noise and vibration resulting from the use of the infrastructure. The DNSH criteria of protecting and restoring biodiversity did not apply as the activities were not carried out in a protected area.\nFor the economic activities related to point 6.16, “Infrastructure enabling low-carbon waterway transport”, the DNSH criteria were met. Specifical- ly, with regard to the adaptation to climate change criteria, analysis of a 20-year timeframe did not reveal any physical climatic risks for the activ- ity. For the technical criteria related to “Sustainable use and protection of waters and marine resources”, an EIA was carried out that did not show any impact of the project on water resourc- es. With reference to the “Transition to a circular economy”, an environmental and waste management plan as well as a construction environmental man- agement plan were adopted; where possible, these seek to embrace the principles of recycling, reuse and re- covery of materials. An EIA led to spe- cific measures taken to reduce noise and dust emissions produced during the works. The EIA also showed that\nINTRODUCTION\n1. SUSTAINABILITY\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\nthere are no protected areas on the site of the project or in the immediate vicinity; therefore, the DNSH criteria for the protection and restoration of biodi- versity and ecosystems — which require the implementation of biodiversity mit- igation and compensation measures - are not applicable.\nThe DNSH criteria for the economic\nactivities related to point 9.1, “Close-to- market research, development and in- novation” were met. In particular - with reference to “Adaptation to climate change” the Group identified the potential climate risks of the solutions developed with an impact on its eco- nomic activities during the expected duration of the project. It conducted an analysis of the potential impacts on water resources. With regard to the potential risks to circular economy ob- jectives deriving from the desired solu- tion, possible recycling measures were identified, to be implemented where feasible. None of the substances listed in Appendix C of Annex | to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 were pro- duced or used in the development of solutions. in terms of the potential im- pacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, none of the economic activities were carried out in biodiversity-sensitive ar- eas (including Natura 2000).\nFor economic activities related to sec- tion 6.5, “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles”, the DNSH criteria were met as the vehicles complied with the air pollution requirements.\n\nMaire Tecnimont analysed its compli- ance with the minimum social safe- guarding requirements of the EU Tax- onomy in the conduct of its business. This analysis was carried out in ac- cordance with article 18 of the Tax- onomy Regulation and on the basis of the recommendations contained in the Draft Report on Minimum Safeguards prepared by the EU Platform on Sus-\n:\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\ntainable Finance (July 2022). Compli- ance with minimum safeguards is de- termined by evaluating performance criteria related to four topics:\n> Human rights, including workers’ rights; > Anti-corruption; > Taxation; > Fair competition.\nThe social safeguarding criteria are mainly covered by the Group Code of Ethics and the Business Integrity Policy, which applies to the Board of Directors, the Auditors, all Maire Tecn- imont Group employees and external personnel (consultants, business part- ners, etc.), suppliers, sub-contractors, clients and any other party at any lev- el that comes into contact with Maire Tecnimont Group companies or acts on their behalf.\n\nThe Group met all minimum require- ments relating to this topic. Indeed, the Group has adopted sets of pol- icies including an HR policy, a human rights policy and an HSE & SA policy to guarantee compliance with and pro- tection of internationally recognised human rights standards. Furthermore, in accordance with the SA 8000:2014 standard - achieved at multi-site lev- el and inspired by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights - Maire Tecnimont recognises and pro- motes respect for individuals, their dig- nity, and their values as a core aspect of their identity and conduct among its own employees and those of its busi- ness partners.\n\nThe Group met all minimum require- ments relating to this topic. The Group considers it essential to conduct its activities in full compliance with laws, regulations, statutory provisions and the principles of integrity and ethical correctness. Consequently, the Code of Ethics strictly prohibits engaging in\n3. OUR PEOPLE AND THE VALUE\nOF HEALTH, SAFETY AND DIVERSITY\npolicy and the values and guidelines guiding the company’s operations in compliance with tax regulations. In line with the Group’s commitment, the parent company Maire Tecnimont S.p.A. and the company Tecnimont S.p.A. are adopting a tax risk con- trol system (the so-called Tax Control Framework), through which internal tax risk is identified, assessed, managed and monitored, in line with the values of transparency, fairness, legality and risk prevention expressed in the Tax Strategy. Furthermore, through its organisational model, the Tax Affairs Department promotes the principles contained in the Tax Strategy and identifies, analyses and manages the main tax-related issues, in order also to provide support to the functions and business lines.\n=\n4.

The MTup platform reached around 70% of the company workforce each month. At the beginning of 2022, an in- ternal communication campaign on our sustainability strategy was launched, which engaged employees from the creative production stage and was implemented across online and offline tools at all Maire Tecni- mont Group sites. During the year, an employee en- gagement campaign on sustainable mobility was delivered, linked to a se- ries of initiatives and deals available.

There were numerous meetings with local authorities and govern- ments in the countries where we operate, which gave us the oppor- tunity to illustrate our sustainability strategy and receive indications and guidelines from them. This also took place in local areas, with our participation in numerous environmental and social initiatives run by non-profit organisations. Finally, through participation in nu- merous sector round tables, working groups and voluntary platforms, we actively contribute to establishing roadmaps and in-depth studies re- lated to many areas involving our sustainability strategy, constantly re- viewing our objectives and actions we have undertaken.\nIn 2022 Maire Tecnimont’s interaction with the media - print and/or online newspapers and TV and radio stations, by virtue of announcements of new contracts, industrial and technological partnerships and in general external communications - as well as participa- tion in conferences organised by news- papers and press agencies, generated around 1,300 dedicated articles and 2,000 mentions.\n9\npublished issues\n46\naverage pages per issue\n14\nee \\c average articles per issue\n6\naa 4 podcasts\ntalks\n&\n2.

Maire Tecnimont’s governance is based on a traditional administration model that includes a Shareholders’ Meeting, a Board of Directors and a Board of Statutory Auditors\".\nUnder the company By-Laws, this model establishes distinct roles and responsibilities for the various corpo- rate bodies: the Shareholders’ Meet-\nObjectives\n> Finalization of the Tax Control Framework and admission to the so-called Cooperative Compliance with Italian Tax Authorities\n> Adoption of Tax Control Framework (parent\n~ ESG-driven objectives primarily as part of the company and Tecnimont S.p.A.).

The role of CFOs in ESG reporting is to guide the com- pany’s evolution towards a culture that is also based on non-financial data. They must ensure that a company’s fi- nancial and non-financial performance is integrated, trans- parent, accountable and sustainable. Reporting trends for the future, in fact, are heading to- wards an integrated report that provides financial and non-financial information in parallel and that gives stake- holders a true vision of the value of the company, against a particularly complex environmental and social backdrop, which requires strategies that are based on an integrated vision of risks and opportunities.\n+\n5. VALUE FOR TERRITORIES\nAND COMMUNITIES\n| ae\n_\nHow do ESG metrics fit into the current environment? In the current environment, all stakeholders -— especially investors — no longer evaluate the performance of a com- pany by considering only traditional metrics, but those in the ESG field too; this means they can measure an organ- isation’s ability to create a greater and different kind of medium-to-long-term value compared to the economic-fi- nancial one. In this sense, environmental, social and governance re- porting (ESG reporting) has become an important way for companies to differentiate themselves and gain a competitive advantage, as well as a fundamental driver of reputation and success, particularly against the back- drop of the energy transition, which will be a feature of the coming decades.\n>\nWhat is the role of the CFO?\nThe CFO has a significant role to play in consolidating ESG\nreporting, in order to:\n>\nensure that non-financial data are accurate and consis- tent with the company’s ESG strategy and objectives guarantee both historical data and ESG objetives are\nAPPENDIX\n=\nESG disclosure\nis\ntransforming\nthe role of the CFO\n=o",

The results of the self-assessment were shared in advance with the Lead Independent Director and presented to the Board of Directors and reported in the 2022 Corporate Governance Report.\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors also conducted a self-assessment for 2022, concerning among other mat- ters the adequacy of the composition of the Board of Statutory Auditors, the professional expertise on the Board, and the functioning and climate of its meetings. In particular, the self-as- sessment procedure of the Maire Tecnimont S.p.A.’s Board of Statuto- ry Auditors was designed around the guidelines issued on the subject by the CNDCEC ((taly’s council of chartered accountants) and the indications in “The Self-Assessment of the Board of Statutory Auditors”, published by the CNDCEC in May 2019.\nWith reference to the year ended 31 December 2022, the self-assessment was supported by the Group’s Cor- porate Affairs, Governance & Com- pliance department and conducted through specific questionnaires; these took into account the indications re- ferred to in article 2, principle VIII of the “Corporate Governance Code” of Borsa Italiana S.p.A.

Specif- ically, this Committee is in charge of:\n> examining sustainability matters related to the business and to rela- tions with stakeholders; examining the reporting and con- solidation system for drafting the Group’s Sustainability Report that includes the Non-Financial State- ment as per Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 (“NFS”); examining the Maire Tecnimont Group’s proposed Sustainability Plan, which is part of the multi-year Industrial and Strategic Plan, and giving an opinion prior to its approv- al by the Board of Directors; examining the Maire Tecnimont Group’s Sustainability Report, which includes the NFS, and giving an opinion prior to its approval by the Board of Directors; supervising the sustainability activ- ities of the Maire Tecnimont Group, including through specific informa- tion provided for this purpose by the competent Company and Group Functions; monitoring the position of the Com- pany on sustainability topics and in particular on the ethics indicators of sustainability; giving opinions on_ sustainability topics if they are required by Board of Directors.\nThe Internal Sustainability Committee, a strategic advisory body for the Chief Executive Officer of Maire Tecnimont\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 55",

The function is also responsible for the related preliminary activities and verifying the data col- lection and consolidation process and information contained therein.\nThe Group Sustainability Function, part of the Group Institutional Relations, Communication & Sustainability Func- tion of the Company, is responsible for implementing the Group’s sustainability strategy, in line with the Sustainable De- velopment Goals (SDGs) defined by the aforementioned Internal Sustainability Committee, liaising with internal and ex- ternal stakeholders through stakeholder engagement, as well as planning and monitoring sustainability initiatives.

The Business Integrity Policy and the policies already adopted on Health and Safety, the Environment, Human Resources, Human Rights, the Supply Chain, Quality, and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion set out the Maire Tecnimont Group’s vision, as well as its reference principles, on Sustainability issues.\nFinally, in 2022 the Maire Tecnimont Innovation Board, was established; this advisory body serving the Company’s senior management is tasked with pro- viding support for evaluating decisions with Group value and impact in the field of technological innovation and company transformation.\n\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting of 8 April 2022 resolved - in line with previous years - to establish a long-term incen- tive plan for the CEO and COO of Maire Tecnimont, as well as selected top managers, based on financial instru- ments and set over three-year cycles. The Board of Directors subsequent- ly implemented the first cycle via the 2022-2024 LTI Plan, which, as part of the performance objectives measured at the end of the three-year vesting period, establishes a 10% weighting in sustainability-related parameter linked to the various pillars of the Group’s Sustainability Strategy, i.e. local con- tent, policies, investment in training, performance relating to the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, CO, emissions and technologies enabling the energy transition and the circular economy,\nFor more information on the Remu- neration Policy and the procedure for determining remuneration, please refer to the provisions contained in the “Re- port on the 2023 Remuneration Policy and the Fees Paid”, published on Maire Tecnimont’s corporate website.\n2.

To further embed these topics as an integral factor in the Company’s indus- trial strategy, a 10%-weighted objective closely linked to ESG issues was intro- duced as part of the corporate objec- tives in the MBO plan for the CEO and COO as well as to selected top manag- ers; in 2022 this focused on reducing the emission impact at Group level.\nThe ratio between the highest total remuneration received in 2022 by the CEO and COO to the median total remu- neration of employees is 23°. It should be noted that this analysis concerned the workforce employed by the Maire Tecnimont Group’s main Italian compa- nies, as it constitutes a significant and representative share of Human Capital, amounting to approximately 40% of the total global headcount at 31 De- cember 2022. More specifically, the scope of data collection includes Maire Tecnimont S.p.A. and the main Italian companies that - by virtue of their tar- get business - may be considered “ho- mogeneous” (Tecnimont S.p.A., KT - Kinetics Technology S.p.A., NextChem S.p.A., MyReChemical S.r.I. and Neosia Renewables S.p.A.). On the other hand, it is not deemed relevant to disclose the ratio between the percentage in- crease of the highest remuneration to the percentage increase of the median total remuneration of employees due to the change of the Company’s CEO and CEO during 2022.\n3.

It also plays a fundamental role in the structured and integrated management of the growing complexity of information and KPIs in the ESG field, and consequently in the pursuit of sustainability objectives.\nIn terms of compliance, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 on the new sustainability reporting obligation, which modifies the current reporting requirements of the NFRD (Non Finan- cial-Reporting Directive) and will enter into force from 1 January 2024, requires companies to digitally “label” the information they report to make it readable and ready to add to the European Single Access Point (ESAP) provided for in the Capital Markets Union Action Plan.\nIn addition, from a corporate funding perspective, ESG fac- tors are now increasingly a parameter used when assess- ing bank financing and credit; this is based on what is re-\nAPPENDIX\n|\nLi\nPe\nie\ni\n4!\ni\nquired by the technical standards of the European Banking Authority, which implies that advanced technologies may also be useful for demonstrating how sustainability objec- tives have been achieved.\nIn view of the above, in 2021 Maire Tecnimont began the process of managing and consolidating ESG data via an integrated digital platform (ESGeo), which is audited and certified in accordance with the main reference standards. ESGeo’s functionality has made it possible to manage the reporting information in a collaborative way and with the help of a work flow process that incorporates the alloca- tion, validation and approval phases, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy and traceability of the data. The platform also gives access to detailed data by sister company, by project and by geographical area, which makes it possible to meet the demands of the GRI Standards optimally. By digitalising sustainability data collection, the Maire Tecni- mont Group has traceable and higher quality information available, which can also be used to more accurately iden- tify sustainability objectives.\n5.

In order to consolidate the principles of conduct, monitoring and control already adopt- ed by the Group to prevent corruption crimes, the Maire Tecnimont Board of Directors also approved, on 16 Decem- ber 2021, the Maire Tecnimont Group’s Business Integrity Policy raised accord- ing to international guidelines and the ISO 37001 standard.

During 2022, the Business Integrity Policy, was adopted by all the companies di- rectly and indirectly controlled by Maire Tecnimont through the competent cor- porate bodies.\nThe Business Integrity Policy is con- sistent with the tenth principle of the Global Compact, which repudiates cor- ruption “in all its forms, including extor- tion and bribery” and clearly outlines which behaviours are permitted and which are prohibited. In particular:\npractices aimed at promoting and/ or facilitating and/or putting in place any behaviour, active or pas- sive, from which an illegitimate or unlawful benefit derives or may de- rive in favour of an individual and/or third parties and/or the Maire Tecn- imont Group are not allowed; it is expressly forbidden to exploit existing relations with persons in the role of public official or persons in charge of a public service for the purpose of illegal mediation, or to promise, offer or provide money or other benefits (gifts, donations, sponsorships, promises of employ- ment, etc.), directly or through a third party, to a public official or a private individual, or to an individual indicat- ed by a public official, or to direct- ly or indirectly authorise anyone to carry out such activities in order to unduly promote or favour the inter- ests of the Maire Tecnimont Group or breach the applicable laws; financial contributions to political\nparties or to associations and bod-\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nies directly linked to political parties are allowed only if permitted by law, and only if expressly authorised by the competent corporate bodies.\nThe Business Integrity Policy is an integral part of a broader system of controls designed to standardise and make consistent the conduct of indi- viduals within the Maire Tecnimont Group. This system is made up of pol- icies, company regulations, standards, procedures and work instructions aimed at enabling the identification, measurement, management and mon- itoring of the main risks. The docu- ment system is easily accessible on the Group’s website and intranet.\nThe Code of Ethics, the 231 Model and the Business Integrity Policy guide the resources that operate for and on be- half of the Company with respect to business control processes and raise awareness of such processes.\nIn order to strengthen the dissemina- tion and knowledge of the Maire Tecn- imont Group’s principles and rules of conduct, the Group Corporate Affairs, Governance & Compliance Function, in collaboration with the Group De- velopment & Compensation Function, assists in drawing up and implement- ing a training plan for internal and ex- ternal personnel. The plan covers the 231/2001 Decree, the 231 Model, the Group Code of Ethics, the Business Integrity Policy and other related ar- eas of interest for all Maire Tecnimont Group companies. It is vital that all internal and external Maire Tecnimont personnel are extensively informed of and trained on the importance of legal\n>\n3.

The training will be made available to all Group employ- ees and collaborators in the first half of 2023, with the aim of having 80% of the recipients using it by next year.\nTo spread knowledge of the Maire Tecnimont Group’s ethical principles, in the context of business relations all third parties are required to com- ply with the applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws and the Group’s ethical principles.\nThe system of internal controls and the compliance with the anti-corrup- tion principles and rules adopted by the Group are examined and assessed by the Maire Tecnimont Group Internal Audit Function and by the Supervisory Bodies, where appointed, on the basis of their audit plans.\nTax governance\nThe Maire Tecnimont Group’s Tax Strategy, which applies to all Group companies, was approved by the Board of Directors of the parent com- pany Maire Tecnimont S.p.A. on 19 December 2022 and by the Board of Directors of Tecnimont S.p.A. on 22 December 2022.\n,\n4.

As an EPC Contractor, all risks related to the health and safety of employees both on construction sites and in offices are continuously analysed and mitigated. HSE risk management is based on the principles of prevention, protection, awareness, promotion and participation; its aim is to ensure the health and safety of workers and to protect the environment and the general welfare of the community. Even if these actions are taken, the risk of harmful events to human health and the environment cannot be excluded. In addition, possible risks may relate to environmental non-compliance. The Maire Tecnimont Group is also exposed to risks related to climate change, such as: > the impact of stricter laws and regulations on energy efficiency and climate change, which may lead to increased operating costs and thus reduced investment in the sector the impact of client awareness and sensitivity to climate change and GHG emissions reduction, resulting in a shift to low-carbon products the impact of climate change mainly due to greenhouse gases leading to changes in temperature and seasonality in different geographical areas The development of “general environmental regulations” could generate new business opportunities for Maire Tecnimont, in the growing market for low-carbon products and services. The Group’s expertise in developing sustainable solutions for its clients, and its ability to react quickly to changes in environmental regulations, are clear competitive advantages. The number of clients and end users who are demanding greener solutions and renewable energy technologies is growing. The Maire Tecnimont Group is already providing low-carbon solutions to its clients, and is therefore equipped to handle the potential growth in demand. This is due above all to its NextChem subsidiary, a company focused on the energy transition.\nBaseline scenario and Material topic ‘© description of risks/opportunities\n1.

Particular emphasis is placed on the technology used to protect the confidential and proprietary information managed by IT systems. However, the hardware and software products and information contained in the Company’s IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as malicious activity or fraud by unauthorised third parties who intentionally induce an employee to send confidential information in writing or orally by e-mail, fax, letter or telephone, cyber attacks, system or computer network failures or computer viruses. The inability of IT systems to function properly for any reason could compromise operations and lead to reduced performance, significant repair costs, transaction errors, data loss, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation, and adverse effects on business transactions and reputation.\n5.

Enterprise Access that authenticates all users using multi- factor authentication procedures or security certificates. The Enterprise Access Service also filters access to its services so that devices or PCs without an antivirus, connections from untrustworthy locations or users who do not meet the company’s policies are flagged up and access is denied. Anti-fraud systems managed by artificial intelligence Open Source Intelligence tools to search for sensitive corporate information on the dark web and protect domains and users more broadly Continuous, effective threat management through a 24/7 Security Operation Centre to prevent virus activity, phishing, spam or spoofing and malicious domains regular back-up procedures relocation/decentralisation of parts of systems (i.e. Sap) outside Head Office\n>\n>\nPeriodic evaluation of IT security according to ISO:27001.

As an Engineering & Technology firm with aspirations to be- come a worldwide leader in the energy transition, it is Maire Tecnimont’s duty to lead the way in developing climate solutions that make a genuine and en- during difference.\nNumerous initiatives are already in progress to increase the energy effi- ciency of our plant designs and reduce the environmental impact of our tra- ditional technologies. We are actively developing technological solutions and forming partnerships to advance the circular economy, green chemistry, low-emission hydrogen, and decarboni- sation services we offer to our clients and partners.\nWe are achieving this by leveraging the collective knowledge and skills of our Group companies, combining expertise from our established business with new skills related to low-carbon and environmentally friendly practices. Our efforts to promote the energy transition have resulted in the establishment of partnerships across Europe, the Amer- icas, India, and the Middle East, leading to agreements for the construction of plants that will significantly contribute to greenhouse gas reduction efforts once operational.\nWe have also observed a growing in- terest among our clients in adopting\nAPPENDIX\nmeasures to mitigate environmental impacts through process improve- ments and individual plant component optimisations. Our digitalisation efforts are contributing to reducing our car- bon footprint, and we are taking full advantage of its benefits.\nFour interrelated macro trends are coming together to enable and compel action on energy transition and green acceleration around the world.\nThe first is the need to sustainably feed the planet while developing in- novative energy carriers.\nThe second is the need to prevent global warming and achieve a dras- tic reduction in CO, emissions. The third is the need to reduce use of fossil sources for fuels and chem- ical production. The fourth is the need to support production output standards nec-\nessary to enable GDP growth.\nFour each of these four needs, sus- tainable nitrogen solutions, hydrogen and circular carbon, as well as sus- tainable fuels and polymers are the backbone of any feasible long-term sustainability strategy.\nAs Maire Tecnimont is a provider of unique high value adding technologi- cal solutions, we stay focused on four business clusters that must play a leading role in accessing a global sus- tainable economy.\nBidt ons *\niK\n|\n2.

In accordance with the new methodology, the Company recalculated direct and indirect emissions, eliminating the contribution of subcontractors in the aforementioned calculation, in line with the GHG Protocol, and included this emission contribution only in the indirect Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 and 2 data for the years 2021 and 2020 were restated and were included in the scope of the 2022 Sustainability Report Assurance by PwC.\n501\n2020\n2021\n2022\nGHG EMISSION INTENSITY [kg CO, /MAN HOURS WORKED]\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 87\n2.

OUR PEOPLE AND THE VALUE\nOF HEALTH, SAFETY AND DIVERSITY\nthe consumption of electricity (“Scope 2”) and_ other indirect emissions (“Scope 3”), which overall make up the basis for comparison with the baseline.\nWith regard to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, the Group has reduced the GHG emission intensity for offices and construction sites in 2022 compared to 2021.\nThe offices figure benefits from smart working and energy efficiency activities implemented in particular by subsidiary Tecnimont S.p.A. at the Group’s Milan headquarters. In 2022, the number of hours worked on sites by Maire Tecni- mont personnel increased, resulting in a slight increase in emissions in terms of absolute values, but in terms of hourly unit values the indicator decreased due to the mix of geographical areas of the projects and the progress of the various construction sites, most of which were in the final phase.\nIn addition to the Group’s emissions value there are those of the MyReplast plant. The plant carries out the upcy- cling of plastic waste - through a pro- cess of mechanical recycling and com- pounding - in order to obtain recycled polymers of a high quality which offer excellent application-related _ perfor- mance, with the capacity to replace vir- gin plastics in many sectors. In 2020, its emissions were 1,885 tonnes CO, eq., in 2021 3,164 tonnes CO, eq. and 2,920 tonnes CO, eq. in 2022. The figures for 2022 remain in line with those for 2021, the slight decrease in the figure follows the plant’s production trend.\nThe aforementioned trend in reduced emissions (as well as the forecasts for the next few years) are in line with the objectives set for 2023 and 2030.\nThe table above shows the aggregate volume of indirect emissions included in Scope 3 (“Purchased Goods & Ser- vices , 6“ Upstream Transportation” and “Waste generated in Operations”).\n4. INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\n\nYear\n2020\n2021\n2022\nThe increase in Scope 3 emissions ob- served in 2022 compared to 2021 can be mainly attributed to a greater volume of expenditure and the relative mix of materials purchased, as well as to the different phases of the projects that ex- ert an influence over the mix of waste produced by construction sites during the year.\nWith reference to emissions related to the supply chain, which represent over 90% of the total, the Group has launched a strategic pathway to ensure that the chain of suppliers and sub-con- tractors are in line with the decarbonisa- tion objectives by 2050.\nSpecifically, the dedicated working group within the MET Zero task force lunched a structured process of engag- ing suppliers on measurement method- ologies and aligning them with our ob- jectives.\nPlan towards carbon neutrality - MET zero task force\nClimate change emerges from the ma- teriality analysis as one of the issues that Maire Tecnimont Group Stake-\nScope 3 Emissions\n- Business Travel &\nCommuting\n[tonnes of CO, eq,]\nScope 1 emissions\n[tonnes of CO, eq.]\n2018 - Baseline\n11,012 11,826 9,256\n5.

  "page_47": "=\nThe decarbonisation plan was imple- mented with a holistic approach and involved different business functions with cross-functional skills and knowl- edge. The decarbonisation strategy is integrated with the new 2023-2032 business plan of the Maire Tecnimont Group, which positions itself as a key player in the energy transition, involving its entire value chain on this journey.\nPlanned _ structural measures include the reduction of energy consumption, the switch to renewable energy sourc- es and the inclusion of biofuels, which will produce a gradual reduction in an- nual emissions, considering also a mix of compensation solutions for the re- sidual part of the ‘hard to abate’ emis- sions. In the following paragraphs, you can find details of the individual reduc- tion and efficiency activities by area of action with reference to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\nWith regard to Scope 3 emissions, over which the Group has no direct control, a roadmap has been set to impact the supply chain in relation to suppli- er emissions and emissions from the transport of people and goods, achiev- ing carbon neutrality by 2050. With specific reference to the supply chain, the Group wants to take a leading role in supporting and guiding suppliers and value chain actors to reduce their GHG emissions. The first step is to im- prove the monitoring and calculation of emissions through the so-called “car- bon tracker”, an innovative tool made available to an initial group of selected suppliers and which will form the ba- sis for identifying areas of intervention with the aim of setting reduction tar- gets as soon as possible, in the con- text of the MET Zero Plan.\n\nTo reach the target of zero emissions scope 1 and 2 by 2080, it was con- sidered strategic to start with the Mi- lan HQ in the office sector. The latter in fact contributes around 50% of scope 1 and 2 emissions related to the\nINTRODUCTION\n1. SUSTAINABILITY\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\ngroup’s locations. With this in mind, a medium-term plan has been defined that aims to reduce HQ emissions by 50% as early as 2025. All the actions detailed in this three-year plan are therefore aimed at defining a ethical model that can later be exported to all the group’s offices. This plan relies on two pillars - energy efficiency and the purchase of green energy.\nThe energy efficiency component in turn breaks down into a management contribution and a technological one. Following an initial in-depth analysis of energy consumption and business pro- cesses, so-called “bad energy habits” were identified, leading to the definition of energy-saving policies and proce- dures. As an example, a fine-tuning of the switching on/off of the lighting and air-conditioning system was defined, which has already brought initial bene- fits in the second half of 2022.\nFrom a technological point of view, on the other hand, a market scouting of innovative efficiency solutions was car- ried out, which led to the definition of an investment plan to support the first target set for 2025. Examples include smart lighting, building automation systems equipped with weather-pre- dictive technology, power quality sys- tems, loT sensors, shielding films and more. It is clear that digital support is crucial to the success of the efficiency plan. For this reason, an EMS (energy management system) platform was de- veloped to collect, correlate, process and present the data collected from devices and plants. This allows con- tinuous monitoring aimed at constant optimisation of consumption with con- sequent reduction of emissions.\nAs far as the purchase of green energy is concerned, the foundations of the new energy supply contract for 2023 were laid, which provides for the purchase of energy from certified renewable sources covered by guarantees of origin. These attest to the renewable origin of electric- ity and serve to promote the transition to a low-carbon economy. It is expected\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nthat this first tranche of operations de- scribed above will lead to an incremen- tal abatement of about 2,200 t CO, by 2025, to be followed by cyclical contin- uous improvement initiatives geared to- wards carbon neutrality.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Maire Tecn- imont set up a subgroup of the MET Zero task force to analyse data on GHG emissions related to the con- struction phase of its EPC business (scope 1-2 first and then scope 3) and to define, together with Subcontrac- tors involved in the erection of works and plants contracted to Maire Tecni- mont worldwide, possible actions to be implemented both in the design phase of the construction site and in the con- struction phase.\nThe group focused on possible mea- sures to make the business more ef- ficient, both in terms of consumption related to the construction site offices and warehouses and the vehicles and equipment used during construction, and in terms of replacing the diesel fuel used to generate the necessary ener- gy with solutions with a lower environ- mental impact.\nThe actions identified as effective and\nsustainable were: > photovoltaic panel installations > gradual replacement of the car fleet with hybrids and then electric cars use of green fuels (biodiesel) connection to the local power grid where possible support of a dedicated site energy manager dedicated staff training to promote ethical behaviour periodic energy audits at production sites (construction sites) Based on the above, a strategic plan was developed to achieve Scope 1 and 2 carbon neutrality for Maire Tecni- mont by 2030. For the three-year pe- riod 2023-2025, when _ challenging\nprojects in North/Central Africa and the\nMiddle East are underway or about to\n22 For more details on energy consumption, see the data in Appendix - Sustainability Performance.\n3. OUR PEOPLE AND THE VALUE\nOF HEALTH, SAFETY AND DIVERSITY\nbe launched, ad hoc preliminary studies have been developed to define the ap- plicability of the above measures, with a particular focus on the optimal potential of photovoltaic panels to be installed on construction sites in order to maximise the cost-benefit ratio in reducing Maire Tecnimont’s carbon footprint, with the aim of achieving a reduction in emis- sions of up to 50% on a single construc- tion site compared to the traditional use of diesel for energy production.\n\nDuring 2022, an information campaign was carried out with all major logis- tics service providers involved in our implementation projects: The aim was to draw their attention to the journey taken by the Maire Tecnimont Group to achieve its goals of reducing CO, emis- sions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\nThe first step on this long journey is to understand whether our partners are on the same path, whether they are aligned with our mission, whether they already have some good practices in place or are in the process of implementing targeted CO, reduction plans. They were therefore asked to provide a sustainability plan, if already in place, with a focus on reduc- ing CO, emissions and detailing short and long term targets.\nWhere action\nno was taken, we lated their interest on the issue by es- tablishing a dialogue to communicate the objectives of the Met Zero Task Force. What our logistics partners have or have not yet implemented leads us to define and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.\nstimu-\nStarting from weaknesses: most of them have not yet taken any action to reduce emissions, since the shipper is an intermediary between Maire Tecni- mont and the transport market (local road hauliers, shipowners, shipping companies, airlines, railway companies, etc.). A number of targeted actions\n90 CREATING VALUE\n4. INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 91\nthat some of our partners are carry- ing out are aimed at reducing Scope 1 emissions (building efficiency, introduc- tion of Smart Working, replacement of company vehicles for employees). How- ever, these actions are not reflected in the transport services they coordinate and for which they are responsible, during the execution of transports to our construction sites.\nWhat strengths did we find? We found partners with a strong interest in the topic, interested in understanding what our group is doing and how. Many were proactive in their search for useful infor- mation for our growth path, which is only such if shared proactively. Our audience of shippers also includes international players, some of whom have approached the issue of emissions thanks to our in- volvement, as it may not be a particularly significant issue in their countries. Humil- ity and the desire to work as a team is a winning formula that we can invest in and continue to work on.\nEach Logistics Service Provider is part of our supply chain and therefore an important partner: by increasingly aligning our visions and actions, we can implement useful strategies to achieve this important and essential goal.\nIn the coming year, it will be increasing- ly necessary to obtain useful informa- tion about the way in which companies to which services are subcontracted, whether national or international, op- erate within each type of transport, in order to make our needs understood by the market and to obtain clear feedback.\nOn the other hand, as far as packaging and all related aspects are concerned, there has been a strong focus on con- tinuously achieving, if not improving, saturation targets by trying to optimise the use of the means of transport to which this practice can be applied (con- tainers, lorries and railway wagons). In the coming year, we will also be fo- cusing more on the characteristics of the packaging provided by our suppli-\n5.

Hours worked are seen as representative of the Group’s overall activity. In 2022, the Energy Intensity indicator de- creased compared to 2021 for all our construction sites and Group offices. For offices, the figure is affected by the application of smart working and energy efficiency activities imple- mented in particular by the subsid- iary Tecnimont S.p.A. at the Group’s Milan Headquarters and decreased from 7,030 kJ in 2021 to 6,634 kJ in 2022. For construction sites, it went from 18,581 kJ in 2021 to 18,155 kJ in 2022. This reflects a percentage reduction in environmental impact, partly due to the geographical mix of projects and the progress of the vari- ous construction sites, most of which were in their final stages.\nThe following main consumptions are monitored for continuous improvement: + natural gas for heating offices; > electricity for air conditioning, com- puter equipment, lighting, etc.; fuel for power needed for emergen- cy generators and heating units; fuel for private and public transport for employees’ journeys to work; fuel for the transportation of suppli- ers’ goods or services.\nThe Maire Tecnimont Group monitors the energy consumption of temporary structures at its construction sites, including plant and machine power consumption, and that of suppliers of materials and the private vehicles used by sub-contractors?",

The choice of an agroforestry model, which integrates the planting of trees into an agricultural system, aims to find a compromise between the needs of local communi- ties and the balance of ecosystems, favouring the bene- ficial integration of species. The trees and their fruits are owned by the farmers, allowing them to diversify and sup- plement their income and in some cases to start micro-en- trepreneurship initiatives.\nThe trees are planted according to a methodology that fol-\nlows three basic principles, recommended by the Global\nLandscapes Forum:\n>\nTransferring skills to communities and ensuring a long\nlife for trees.\nInnovation also changes the way we approach habitual ac- tivities. In 2021, the pilot project “EEE- Energy Efficiency and Carbon Footprint Reduction” demonstrated that it is possible to find new design solutions - applicable to EPC projects - for the reduction of the Group’s carbon footprint and for the improvement of energy efficiency in compliance with the Equator Principles IV (international guidelines ad- opted by the institutions that finance the construction of infrastructures and industrial plants). The implementation of the EEE project has allowed us to develop Guidelines (expected to be published in 2023) that represent the methodology for identifying possible engineering or equip- ment selection solutions. These innovative solutions enable a reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (as defined\nBLOCK DIAGRAM FOR IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS WITH LOWER GHG EMISSIONS\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 93\n3.

Monitoring, guiding and supporting the care of trees in their early years.\nThis type of tree management gives trees a long life by optimising their ability to absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere. It also encourages the development of mi- cro-organisms, improves water retention, reduces erosion and run-off from soils and, in the long term, allows nature to regenerate. To date, the Group has supported the plant- ing of more than 2,700 trees in 9 countries (Cameroon, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, Madagas- car, Malawi and Tanzania) with an estimated absorption capacity of 343.20 tonnes of CO, over the next 10 years.

They can be applied at an early design stage or suggested to clients at the offer stage. The EEE project has demonstrated that sometimes the solutions identified do not increase the project cost, and in any event the cost of a more sustainable solution should no longer be a discriminating factor in its implementation. The positive intention for the future is to make the analy- sis proposed in the EEE project a standard activity in the design phase and a desirable in the tender phase, also involving technology licensors for a more comprehensive analysis. The expectation is to create more value in our designs and a better reputation among our clients.\nAs members of the Alliance for the Circular Economy, through our advo- cacy policies we are committed to rep- resenting the Alliance’s joint work in creating a culture of circularity among companies and in society, and in creat- ing models and tools for implementing initiatives and monitoring results.",

Firstly, the PSCL (home- work travel plan) was released, which promotes the use of sustainable solu- tions (electric scooters, car sharing, etc.) for home-work travel by offering concessions and discounts for all com- pany staff. In addition, with regard to company cars, a market analysis of vehicles and their CO, emission levels was carried out to finalise the new car list, which includes plug-in hybrid, mild hybrid and electric cars. All cars in the company fleet will then be equipped with mileage measurement and related carbon emissions reporting devices.\n>\nMoreover, to more accurately monitor the carbon footprint of home-to-work journeys by the end of 2022, the com- pany’s office booking application has been released with the ability to indi- cate how and from where you travel to your workplace. This fully anonymised data will then be processed for work- home commuting reporting purposes. For 2023 and beyond, the aim is to promote cycling and/or shared mobility among colleagues through a campaign based on reward models, supported by a dedicated application to be installed on company devices.\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 95\n94 CREATING VALUE\n3.

The same quantity of water was discharged into sewers over the last three years. Of the 48,110 m°, only 15,889 m*® was drawn off and then discharged in areas considered to be under water stress?°.\nThe facilities of the complex use un- treated ground water to feed the Heat- ing Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, both for heating and air con- ditioning.\nIn 2020, 1,121,802 m* of ground water was drawn and then discharged, while in 2021, 1,071,580 m? was drawn. The figure was 945,750 m in 2022. These quantities do not fall into areas con- sidered as being under “water stress”. During construction, the safeguarding of water resources is one of the topics highlighted during training and environ- mental awareness campaigns.\nO Waste water is discharged into the ur- the ban sewer- safeguarding age network, of water for which no resources drainage au- thorisation is is one of needed under the topics the current lo- highlighted cal law.\nIn accordance with Client rules and the local laws, no water can be discharged\n23 By water stress we mean the ability or inability to meet the demand for water, both human and ecological (see GRI 303). The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool created by the World Resources Institute was used to assess areas subject to water stress. Those classified as being subject to “High” and “Extremely high” levels were considered to be water stress areas.\n=e\ninto the public sewer or directly into seas and rivers. In particular, water consumption is influenced by the work- ing phase of construction sites during the year and is largely proportional to the number of hours worked during the observation period. In 2022, there was a slight increase in the unit values of water consumption compared to 2021, from 207,142 m* in 2021 to 208,779 m® in 2022, due to the different mix of project phases. Water consumption on construction sites over the last three years is pre- sented in detail in “Appendix - Sus- tainability Performance”.\nThe Maire Tecnimont Group takes great care with the collection, trans- port and processing of waste, and uses licensed, qualified external pro- viders.\nThe Group has provided several loca- tions with segregated collection bins",

Paper represents the highest percent- age of all waste produced; the digitalisa- tion of documents assists a paperless approach, which helps to reduce paper supplies and consequently the volume of paper waste. The Maire Tecnimont Group has started also to increase its purchases of recycled paper, to further encourage a culture of recycling.\nIn 2022 waste production fell. This was mainly due to a substantial reduction in internal reorganisation and restructur- ing activities and the creation of work- stations at the subsidiary Tecnimont S.p.A. compared to 2021 and 2020.\nIn line with Group Policy, daily checks are conducted on waste management and sub-contractors’ behaviours at construction sites, in cooperation with specialised waste companies and in accordance with local laws.\nThe production of waste is also influ- enced by the work phase of the con- struction sites over the course of the year and by the mix of countries in which the various construction sites are located. In 2022, there was an in- crease in waste due to some projects that, in accordance with local laws, produced significant amounts of waste (e.g. excavated soil and rocks). The pro- duction of waste at the Maire Tecnimont Group’s offices and construction sites is presented in detail in “Appendix - Sus- tainability Performance”.\n1. SUSTAINABILITY\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n\nMaire Tecnimont Group’s environmen- tal policy is also made evident during the engineering phase, and this pro- vides an opportunity to propose changes or technological innovations that can reduce environmental impact, bringing environmental and economic benefits to the client, stakeholders and the entire community.\nBiodiversity is one of the aspects the Group takes into account to ensure environmentally friendly and responsi- ble activities.\nThe protection and safeguarding of the environment are key factors and essen- tial business objectives for the Maire Tecnimont Group. The Group is contin- ually committed in the control and mit- igation of its impact on the ecosystem as a result of the projects and activities conducted at its head offices.\nIn 2022, the Group developed many projects in different parts of the world, some of them in the vicinity of ‘biodiver- sity-related vulnerable areas’. The follow- ing cases are the most representative.\nHAIL & GHASHA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND CO, RECOVERY — ONSHORE - UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\nThe site is located in the Ruwais area, around 8.5 km east of the Ruwais industrial area. The recognition of protected fauna/habitats has been conducted in accordance with both EAD (Abu Dhabi Environment Agency) and IUCN (Unione Internazionale per la Conservazione della Natura). At the project stage, the poten- tial ecological impact - particularly habitat loss, disturbance to terrestrial fauna, etc. - was iden- tified - due to the location of the majority of the pipeline within the Houbara Protected Area. This area is specifically designated as a protected area in order to support the reintroduction program of the Ubara Bustard (Chlamydotis un- dulata) bred in captivity by the International Fund for the Conservation of the Ubara (IFHC).\nThe Houbara Protected Area is also a designated important bird area (IBA) [BirdLife International (2019) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Al Houbara] and it supports large mammals (including mountain gazelle Gazella gazella) and Spiny-tailed lizards (Uromastyx aegyptius), a locally protected reptile species in UAE. The Project is ongoing and a list of mitigation measures was identified in order to address the potential terrestrial ecological impacts and to minimise impact of activities e.g. > during the construction phase, exact work corridors will be identified for all activities to be undertaken; Open trenches will be provided with temporary barriers in areas where ani- mals would be present; Light sources will be minimised where possible and ensure that lights are on only when needed. These measures will form part of the environmental management plan - for both Construction and Operation Phases - to be developed for the Project.\n-\nINTRODUCTION\n3.

As per previous years, this opportunity for young people to boost their project management skills met with great appreciation and received numerous applications. For this reason, the Group also wanted to promote a number of tailored training events for all those who submitted their application, as an opportunity to share, discuss and raise awareness of key current and future issues for the Group.\nv, ee\n! =\na\nYar\n<=\nom,\nTe\nee Ce\nes\n* i a\na\n1\n=\nUnderlining the importance of innovation and digitalisation in the context of the Group’s initiatives, these two training events - on the topic of Open In- novation and an interactive workshop on the subject of Agile Project Manage- ment- were organised in collaboration with Professor Henry Chesbrough, Di- rector at the Garwood Centre for Corporate Innovation at Berkeley University, and with the support of qualified partners. Following on from these initiatives, a development program was designed - to be launched in early 2028 - to trial solutions that make it possible to improve the way people work and experience the digital sphere (the Digital Citizen program); it also aims to strengthen soft skills to support young people in acquiring expertise and methods for manag- ing people in line with ongoing changes.\nThe wider corporate program to ac- tively promote an inclusive culture and leverage diversity included an im- portant training course, delivered with the assistance of the Fondo Nuove Competenze, an Italian public fund co-financed by the European Social Fund to encourage companies to in- vest in strengthening their workers’ skills.

The training sessions, which were widely embraced and appreciated, were dedicated not only to diversity and in- clusion topics, but also to strengthen multidisciplinary and cross-functional skills related to topics of practical in- terest for those involved, while also considering the innovation and digi- talisation process taking place in the Group. Moreover as part of the plan, another program was created to focus on boosting managerial skills in roles who has resposability in coordinating groups of people. The longstanding centrality and value of training and Human Capital Develop- ment to the Group has resulted, among other things, in the provision of more than 214,640 hours of training broken down as in the graph on the right.\nThanks to the dual mode of training and development delivery (digital and in-per- son), it was possible to provide about 45,800 hours dedicated to strength- ening soft skills, about 5,600 hours to project management and more than 35,900 hours to technical-specialist subjects, giving priority to initiatives focused on strengthening multicultural\nINTRODUCTION\n3.

In 2022, engagement initiatives in the HSE area aimed at involving leaders were identified: HSE & SA + World Day for Safety and Health at Work: the Maire Tecnimont Group participated in the 2022 ENGAGEMENT edition of the world the International Labour in order and INITIATIVES day promoted by Organization (ILO) to spread strengthen its commitment on these issues (for more information see the box “World Day for Safety and Health at work”); bringing together its construction sites through the organisation of the fifth HSE Group Workshop. Celebration days following strong HSE performances during construction projects. In 2022 to be noted, the HSE Celebration Day for Tecnimont Private Limited Construction Site (for more information see HSE CELEBRATION the box “Tecnimont’s Indian Projects”), the APOC Projects (for more information see the box “HSE DAY Challenges in APOC PP Plant Project”) and PHRC Nigeria (for more information see the box “Nigeria Limited - Two million hours worked without LTIs”); A dual goal achieved by the Maire Tecnimont Group in HSE and Social Accountability, which improves the synergies between the various companies. As part of this, in 2022 the following activities were carried out: > HSE certification: in May 2022, Maire Tecnimont successfully completed the renewal of its HSE Multi- site Certification in accordance with ISO 45001:2018 and ISO 14001:2015 standards. + Social Accountability certification: surveillance audits were carried out by a third-party certification body during 2022 which confirmed the Maire Tecnimont Group’s maintenance of and strong commitment to the SA8000 the work was also carried out MAIRE TECNIMONT management system. During year, significant the SA8000 documentation HSE & SA8000 on system. MULTI-SITE > Social audits: in July 2022, social audits conducted by third-party certification body Bureau Veritas CERTIFICATIONS Italia (BVI) were executed on five Tecnimont suppliers. They were aimed at promoting respect for human rights and work in our supply chain (for more information see the box “Social Audit Campaign’). > VCA certification carried out by third-party certification body BV The Netherlands: = in March and October 2022, a periodic surveillance audit and renewal certification audit were carried out at sister company Tecnimont’s Kallo construction site by the third-party certification body BV The Netherlands. The certification was confirmed and renewed. = In December 2022, the first surveillance audit was carried out at sister company KT-Kinetics Technology’s Rijeka construction site. The certification was confirmed. Social initiatives on HSE and SA8000 topics to support local development, undertaking activities which best reflect the Maire Tecnimont Group’s values. In 2022 the following activities related to this topic HSE & SA SOCIAL were carried out: INITIATIVES + Promoting safety in schools: In October 2022, Maire Tecnimont - as a member of the Unindustria Occupational Health and Safety Technical Group - began planning action in support of Unindustria to promote a culture of safety in schools aimed at encouraging aware and responsible behaviour. Training activities and spread of HSE pills to increase awareness of procedures and good practices on HSE & SA8000 issues in and out of the workplace. As part of this, in 2022 the following activities were carried out: TRAINING > HSE & SA pills: planning began for two pills on the HSE & SA8000 management systems, scheduled for launch in 2023 within MET Academy. > Site induction: harmonization and standardisation of site induction material for all group construction sites. Development and distribution of HSE tools to increase awareness of procedures and good practices on HSE & SA8000 issues in and out of the workplace. As part of this, in 2022 the following activities were carried out: ~ Emergency Management project: Development of a web-based application for real-time monitoring TOOLS of the presence/position of emergency team members within the company headquarters. The tool was officially released in February 2022 (for more information see the box on the following page). + Stop & Coach Program: An innovative program aimed at driving up safety awareness by increasing the engagement and onboarding of our colleagues, clients and subcontractors through a participatory approach (for more information see the box “Stop and Coach Program”).\nco\nongoing promotion TRIR\nand strengthening per million hours per million hours\nof H&S culture\nworked\nAs testament to the great work carried out and our commitment, in July 2022 Unindustria named the Safethink Pro- gram as one of the best projects in the field of HSE culture took second place in the “Grandi Imprese” category of the first edition of the Unindustria “Salute e Sicurezza sul lavoro” Award.\nIn addition to the significant work on the activities described thus far, the effort made by the Maire Tecnimont Group to ensure the safe performance of all work activities, in accordance with the highest health standards, continued in 2022.\nAll the recommendations of the Italian Government and the competent health authorities were therefore fully incor- porated and implemented within the companies’ sites. This was achieved by adopting a preventive protocol set out in specific documents regarding the correct policies and behaviour to be implemented following the emergency.\nThe discussion and sharing of each aspect between the following various corporate functions of all the Maire Tecnimont Italian legal entities was once again fundamental in establishing the best strategies to be implement- ed: the Head of the Prevention and Protection Service, the members of the Prevention and Protection Service, the Company Physician/Coordinating Physician, the HR function, the Gener- al Services function and the Workers’ Representative for Health, Safety and the Environment (RLSSA).\n3.

Smart working and fluid desk policies have been adopted in the Group’s major Italian offices. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the extension of these policies was a key preventative measure for the workforce, with at- tendance in the corporate offices varying as a result. Given the requirement to support the company’s emergency coordinators in carrying out their func- tions efficiently in the event of an emergency office evacuation, a web-based application accessible from all business devices was developed in-house for real-time monitoring of the presence and position in the office of the emergen- cy team members. The tool was developed based on the existing and widely used application for booking workstations; it gives coordinators useful infor- mation for quick and effective emergency management by identifying both the number of staff present and the name/role of all members of the emergency teams present on each floor of the company offices, with immediate access to their company mobile phone number. Finally, in addition to providing real-time information, the application allows you to find out and export this information on a historical basis. This is useful for analysing coverage over time by emer- gency teams, recognising areas for improvement and shaping initiatives more effectively in order to improve them. The tool was released in February 2022 and successfully tested during fire drills conducted on premises.\n<0.135\nLTIR\ntraining hours\nworked\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 115\n3%\nprovided / hours\nworked (on site)",

The Stop & Coach Pro-\ngram proved once again to be the\nmost innovative and distinctive part of our macro-objective of building HSE awareness to prevent accidents. Specifi- cally, the program aims to increase the safety awareness of our Construction Team by promoting a participato- ry approach to managing the measures taken regarding activities not complying with our Safethink Rules for Life. The innovative aspect of this program is that it aims to not only correct behaviour, but ensure a high level of HSE awareness through a coaching process, promoting safe behaviour as part of employees’ value system, and not just through operational instructions. The variety of cultures in- volved in the Maire Tecnimont Group naturally continues to be one of the project’s major challenges, both because of varying levels of maturity on safety issues, but also be- cause of the ways in which different communities give and receive feedback. For this reason, the project places great emphasis on identifying tools that are versatile, and univer- sal to different cultures and roles.\nIn 2022, we continued to organise kick-off meetings to involve new construction sites and related training for all the staff of those sites - supervisors and managers - aimed at building awareness and providing tools to help them approach their roles correctly. The same methodol- ogy used in the program’s launch was applied: the focus\nWHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE PROGRAM\nTikie\npal\n16\nconstruction sites\ninvolved\n(45\nparticipants\n1,/04\nhours of training\n34\nsessions for HSE,\nsite and construction\nManagers\n97\nsessions for\nsupervisors and\nsuperintendents\n8\nsessions for project\ndirectors/project\nmanagers\n1\nsession for the HSE\nhome office team\na\n1.

This strategy, inspired by safety coaching, derives from the goal of empowering workers and leading to safer, more conscious conduct during all construction activities. At the same time, we provided a user-friendly tool, through a sequence of predefined questions that take into account the intercultural differences involved while minimising their impact. Following the training and mentoring activities, the program was implemented in the field through the use of an actual physical card - the “Stop & Coach Card” - a tool that gives workers the authority to stop an unsafe action or situation and manage the coaching activity.\nIn parallel to adding new construction sites to the Stop & Coach Program, in 2022 our efforts also focused on mon- itoring activities for sites where the program had been put in place the previous year. The latter monitoring activity revealed strong commitment on the part of those involved and a high degree of involvement; this emerged from the impact survey carried out by an Watch the Stop & Coach video external consult-\nProgram\ning firm engaged\nin the project.\nfe\na\neran ar\n—\n-\n—\n=\n-\nripe\nao\n_\nhis\nt\nfie\nar\nee\n3.

The Maire Tecnimont Group, in compliance with the SA8000 standard and the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, recognises and promotes among its employees and business partners re- spect for the individual, their dignity and their values as a core aspect of its iden- tity and of its conduct. Accordingly, any form of intolerance, violence, harassment and discrimination (be it based on gen- der, race, nationality, age, political opin- ion, religion, sexual orientation, health condition or socio-economic conditions) is disavowed.\nOne of Maire\nIn order to ensure ethical and respon- sible business management, the Maire Tecnimont Group’s companies are com- mitted to a voluntary social responsibil- ity certification in accordance with the SA8000 management system.\nThis system can be certified through an audit system by an independent body and is based on international human rights standards (ILO and UN conven- tions) and national employment laws. Its purpose is to provide a tool that protects and gives authority to all per- sonnel working for a company and to all those who collaborate with the com- pany, such as suppliers, contractors, sub-contractors, and home workers.\nAs a part of this process, in late 2020, the Maire Tecnimont Group received Multi-site certification from Bureau Veritas Italia in accordance with the SA 8000:2014 standard. Achieving this ambitious goal was the result of coordinated work between the main Group companies that were already in-\n\n4. INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\ndividually SA8000 certified. The great challenge for Maire Tecnimont was to restructure the various SA8000 certi- fications that already existed in individ- ual Maire Tecnimont Group companies under a single control structure.\nMaire Tecnimont is the first Italian group, and the first in the world in the energy industry technology, en- gineering and construction sector, to certify a single social responsibility management system at a multi-geo- graphic level, confirming its commit- ment to the well-being of people in offices and on construction sites.\nIn addressing all these issues, Maire Tecnimont has therefore demonstrat- ed the implementation of a solid and structured management system, made up of policies and procedures that are able to clearly guide the work of the certified companies. The centralisation of the management system, an equally challenging target for a multinational with operations in 45 countries, was possible thanks to the presence of a core of shared values that translate into strategic choices and operational practices applied uniformly among the various companies of the Maire Tecni- mont Group, while taking into account the specific characteristics of the indi- vidual businesses.\nar\na’\na* hha\n“a\nTy\na=\nob\nee\nTEL\ns\nof its clients, suppliers and employees, and each is valued as a strategic asset.\nMaire Tecnimont’s position on safe- guarding human rights is made clear to all stakeholders, both internal and ex- ternal, through the Code of Ethics - a copy of which is provided to new hires\ni\n1,\nFi\nath\n5.

On construc- tion sites, our Construction team plays a lead role in increasing awareness and monitoring of human rights for our sub-contractors: all construction site staff (both supervisors and workers) receive training in Social Responsibility. In 2022, planning began on a training pills focusing on the SA8000 manage- ment system to be delivered on MET Academy, aimed both at new hires as part of their induction and at the entire workforce as a periodic update on the management system.\nThe total number of hours in the re- porting period for the companies in- cluded in the Multi-site certification in relation to training on human rights policies or procedures concerning the human rights aspects of operations were as follows: 1,660 hours in 2020, 8,704 hours in 2021 and 3,197 hours in 2022.\nThe training hours delivered in 2022, slight decrease due to the lower num- ber of hours worked on the Group’s construction sites, however are sub-\nINTRODUCTION\n1.

When relat- ed to SA8000 certified companies, the percentage increased to 64% in 2022. The commitment to human rights training also involves sub-contrac- tors, in addition to employees. 100% of sub-contractors receive human rights issues training.\n\nIn order to facilitate workers’ liaison and communication with company man- agement on matters related to social responsibility, an SA8SO000 (RLSA8000) workers’ representative has been elect- ed at each certified Maire Tecnimont Group company.\nIn 2022, planning began on a process to raise awareness of the SA8000 management system with a particular focus on communication channels, and strengthening of those dedicated to RLSA8000.\n\nA Social Performance Team (SPT) was also set up for every certified company, made up of a balanced representation of managers and representatives of SA8000 workers, and is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the SA8000 Management System. In this context, the SPT conducts a period- ic written risk assessment to identify and prioritise areas of current or po- tential non-compliance with the stan-\n2.

The risk assessment is carried out on the basis of the ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) method- ology that the Maire Tecnimont Group has adapted from the assessment of corporate business risks. Involving the Social Performance Team in this sys- tematic process, the Maire Tecnimont Group’s companies are able to foster worker-manager collaboration around a proactive process that leads to prac- tical workplace improvements.\n\nA central aspect of our vision is to lis- ten and give voice to the Maire Tecni- mont Group’s various internal and ex- ternal stakeholders. We have therefore created a channel for all our stake- holders to send/receive reports, as a direct way of receiving insights and suggestions to improve daily working life. These channels differ depending on the type of stakeholder involved and are all managed through applying thorough analysis and transparency.\nIn particular, alongside the dedicated SA8000 management team and work- er representative mailboxes, the Maire Tecnimont Group has developed more structured ways to access the chan- nels and ensure the anonymity of the complainant, as per the previously mentioned grievance mechanism. Two special sections of the corporate web- site and the internal portal allow both internal and external stakeholders to report alleged breaches of company policies and/or of SA8000 standard requirements. A system for collect- ing reports was also established with ‘physical boxes’, both in offices and in our construction sites.\nIn 2022, as part of the work of up- dating and standardising processes/ procedures, sister company Tecnimont S.p.A.’s procedure to manage com- plaints was published and an aware-\n3.

The promotion and protection of human rights in the supply chain is also managed through audits at our construction sites, including sub-con- tractors’ “leaving camps”. Among the requirements of the management sys- tem, the HSE construction site function is responsible for monitoring its supply chain’s compliance with the SA8000 standard via audits on the facilities of the companies in question. MET has always worked to promote and respect human rights and labour in its supply chain in the activities de- scribed this far; but in 2022 we also launched a new and ambitious activity aimed at monitoring our supply chain - a Social Audit Campaign which was completed in July 2022 with the com- pletion of audits on five Tecnimont suppliers by the third-party certifica- tion body Bureau Veritas (BV) (for more information see the box “Social Audit Campaign”).\n4.

On the subject of social responsibility, as well as on that of health and safety, the Maire Tecnimont Group has put in place many initiatives to generally strengthen awareness on these issues. In 2022, we continued our commitment in this area, especially by strengthen- ing communication on our social media channels, which are fundamental for our Group’s promotion of initiatives and values such as safety and human rights. People’s awareness is an asset we are working on today and which we are committed to for the next few years. In the SA8000 context, dedi- cating focus and commitment to these matters does not only mean improving the well-being of employees, but the even more complex mission to transfer and share these requirements with all the companies that work with us, and this is our challenge for the future.\nness-building program was designed; this will be launched in 2023 with its main focus on the management of complaints and respective channels.\nIn 2022, at the Multi-site aggregate level, we received 51 complaints re- lating to SA8000 requirements, all of which were taken up during the year: 48 reports were handled and success- fully resolved by the end of 2022; the 5 complaints remaining open will con- tinue to be managed in 2023.\n\nRespect for the human rights of the entire production chain that works with our Group is fundamental to building positive, transparent and lasting rela- tionships.\nThe Maire Tecnimont Group makes all its suppliers/sub-contractors aware of these issues so that they undertake to respect human rights in their operations.\nTo this end, our suppliers are required to follow the founding principles of the Code of Ethics and to respect human rights in line with Group policies, with a commitment to adopt best practices in terms of human rights and working con- ditions, occupational health and safety and environmental responsibility.\nIn addition, in line with the Group’s continued commitment in terms of sustainability, Maire Tecnimont has launched structured activities for the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors within its supply chain from supplier scouting to qualification process and post-order management.\nWe are therefore constantly engaged in pre-qualifying our suppliers, con- tractors and partners, a process which sees hundreds of suppliers assessed each year on their performance, in- cluding on human rights and social accountability issues.

Tecn- imont decided to participate, together with Shell, Technip and Linde, in the second phase of the project, lasting three years, starting in 2021 and ending in 2024.\nThe main goal of the project is to verify whether current specifications for LNG production are too restrictive com- pared to real solidification limits of the substances. While the risk of solidification can cause operability and plant safety problems, overly restrictive specifications require very stringent gas purification, with higher energy con- sumption and higher costs of the purification units required for LNG production, and in particular gas purification and processing of Natural Gas Liquids. The design of these plants is an important part of Tecnimont’s core business.\nParticipation in this project is motivated by the possibility of acquiring new knowledge that will enable a more reliable and lower-consumption (and thus lower-emission) design of plants in the natural gas and LNG chain to make the use of natural gas as an energy source increasingly sus- tainable.\nJOINT DEVELOPMENT\n= Jie\n3.

Open Innovation aims to challenge the status quo and help companies adapt to a rapidly changing world. The definition of an Open Inno- vation management strategy therefore becomes a critical factor for success. Another such factor is the implemen- tation process, which depends on its alignment with the corporate vision, so that the process is firstly accepted at management level and then at all levels of the wider corporate culture.\nMaire Tecnimont sees the adoption of an Open Innovation model as a strategic need. Such a model must not seek to wall in the innovation process, but in- stead must open it up to collaboration across a wide network of players: ex- ploiting external resources, developing new products and generating new ideas and sources of income for the Group and the system. To this end, the Maire Tecnimont Group has adopted some Open Innovation practices to accompa- ny the process of transformation which iS Now underway in relation to Open In- novation and related issues, in order to promote and spread the culture of Open Innovation, to establish a presence in innovation environments, to coordinate the Group’s internal and external Open Innovation initiatives, and to enable the innovation ecosystem.\nIn a context in which innovation has be- come a critical factor for success, the adoption of open systems of collabora- tion with a range of players allows us to pool resources and skills in order to develop new solutions.\nNew Initiatives:\nThe Group, through its subsidiary NextChem, has decided to strengthen the scien- tific and research aspects of its expertise in the area of energy transition technolo- gies through an “accelerated innovation” path. To this end, Nextchem and Sapienza University met to try to pool some common interests through the definition of a stable and active partnership between the Group and the University. The “GREEN CHEMISTRY AND MECHATRONICS OPEN INNOVATION LAB” project envisaged in its first year (over a three-year horizon) the setting up of a laboratory at NextChem’s Rome headquarters, where a university scientific research team and engineers made available by the Group work together. Waste To Chemicals is the focus in the first years of activity: in particular, the focus is on optimisation both in the waste feed phase (Development Line 1) and in the study of thermodynamic reactions within the reactor (Development Line 2). Specifically, the objective of the 1Y of Development Line 1 (DIMA) is to define the architecture of the system that enables the analysis of waste and its sorting and blending; while for Development Line 2 (DICMA) the aim is to develop a one-dimensional kinetic block model in Aspen Plus / Hysys and SW CFD. On the University side, the two departments of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (DIMA) and the Department of Chemical, Materials and Environmental Engineering (DICMA) of Sapienza were involved.\n8\nINTRODUCTION\nOPEN INNOVATION\nChange, environment, climate, future, sustainability, new humanism are some of the most recurring keywords, which increasingly take on a practical, tangible and real meaning in an ev- er-changing socio-economic context, where change is increasingly discon- tinuous and difficult to manage. In this uncertain situation, each public or pri- vate entity is called upon to make its own significant contribution through the identification of new responsible business models, new approaches to investment, new processes for techno- logical development and the identifica- tion of new value chains.\nIt is clear that the key factor in facing this profound transformation is the adoption of the paradigm of Sustain- able Open Innovation, i.e. the correct combination of innovation (product,\n3.

Identified our innovation initiative - Call for ideas on vertical sustainability and energy transition through a provider accredited to Federated Innovation@MIND. The aim is for the Group to make an active contribution to the project by offering on the one hand a technological platform to facilitate the industrialization of solutions of interest, and on the other, to offer our commercial platform to facilitate the interna- tional dissemination of these solutions.\nthis is the innovation ecosystem created within the Elis Consortium. Now in its sev- enth edition, OPEN ITALY has evolved into a co-creation lab where large companies, Italian start-ups/SMEs and innovation enablers such as accelerators, research cen- tres, venture capitalists and young talent collaborate. The 2022 edition was held with the involvement of 58 large corporates, with 478 start-up candidates and more than 2900 solutions put forward to meet companies’ challenges (568+ Innovation needs collected, 6 average applications for each need expressed). In addition, par- ticipation in the programme will enable the launch of a masterclass and the provision of 30 scholarships for the training of young people who will participate in the co-in- novation phase. This latest edition introduced the first index measuring the impact generated by innovation, called “Innovation to Impact”, which allows innovative com- panies to guide their processes and strategies with an impact-driven approach and to measure the intentional and unintentional impact of projects and programmes from an integrated (environmental, social and economic) sustainability perspective. In connection with OPEN ITALY, Maire Tecnimont is an industrial enabler of green technologies thanks to the expertise provided by NextChem, and is contributing to the growth of this ecosystem thanks to the strength of our Group.\nis the Italian Cleantech Accelerator of the National Network of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) Accelerators, launched by CDP Venture Capital SGR — Fondo Nazio- nale Innovazione, Eni, LVenture Group and ELIS, with the support of the Corporate Partners Acea, Maire Tecnimont and Microsoft. ZERO was created to identify start- ups with major business potential and a zero-impact solution for the environment. For Maire Tecnimont, initiatives like this are ideal contexts in which to strengthen or develop new partnerships, in full awareness of the tangible and intangible benefits that open innovation can offer both inside and outside the Group. The verticals covered by the programme are perfectly in line with the strategic objectives of the Group and the United Nations SDGs, as the main promoter of the programme is a leading Italian institution and the partners involved are top Italian companies. The second edition of the ZERO programme received 250+ applications and after a rig- orous selection process, the final 9 start-ups were announced at the last Demo Day, each receiving a pre-seed investment and undergoing a 5-month acceleration programme. Accelerated start-ups deal with sustainability and cover various sectors ranging from water management and the waste cycle with a view to savings and the circular economy, to the production of energy from renewable sources, and the reduction of emissions and optimisation of processes. In this edition, an interactive tool with indicators and outcomes was also created to assess the readiness of the start-up against ZERO impact targets.\nMILANO INNOVATION DISTRICT\nFEDERATED INNOVATION@MIND",

This extends to the present day with a consolidated busi- ness structure, at the level of projects and operating companies. Thanks to the regional model, Maire Tecnimont has the opportunity to better under- stand the local areas in which it op- erates and to put in place mitigating measures.\nCollaboration with communities, the optimisation of production chains in each country and constant open dia- logue with stakeholders within institu- tions and civil society are the corner- stones of the way we create value in the areas where we work.\nStarting in 2018, the Group launched a comprehensive programme focused on managing In-Country Value (ICV), understood as locally generated value, with the initial objective of increasing knowledge and understanding of the various regulatory frameworks regard-\n=o\ning ICV on specific countries of inter- est, identifying an action plan aimed at building a tailored approach.\nSubsequently, the Group has contin- ued the programme to further improve its ICV management model and refine the initiatives supported, in order to meet the following requirements: > comply with ICV regulatory require- ments and maximise market oppor- tunities; ensure efficient supply pricing, pro- mote diversification of the supplier base domestically and globally, op- timise the supply mix and reduce supply risks; strengthen relations with strategic partners and local institutions (in- cluding the Italian national context), through a closer relationship with the supply chain of individual terri- tories; develop a resilient regional organisa- tion and strengthen local resources\nMaire Tecnimont has therefore imple- mented a visionary In-Country Value\n160 CREATING VALUE\n5.

At the end of 2022, with particular reference to the TCM-KT JV Azerbaijan project, local personnel amounted to about 49%. Furthermore, in terms of gender composition, the pro- portion of women working in Branch offices was 85%.\nProcurement scenario\nMaire Tecnimont works proactively with local suppliers and subcontractors to boost local skills, support the quality of the material supplied or services performed in order to in- clude them in Maire Tecnimont’s global supply chain, sta- bilise its local footprint and generate value for Azerbaijan in Azerbaijan. For this reason, since 2016, the Maire Tecni- mont Group has had a Purchasing team entirely dedicated to the subsidiary in Azerbaijan, in charge of all purchases on the local market.

INNOVATION THAT\nBRINGS WELL-BEING\nUNIVERSITY AND BUSINESS: AN EXAMPLE OF ICV\nMaire Tecnimont Group has a long history of collaboration with major universities, technology partners, research cen- tres and commercial partners. In recent years, the Group has intensified its collaboration with top Italian and foreign universities, developing research projects and exchanging views and ideas, thus creating a strong bridge between academia and industry. The Group believes strongly in the synergy between academia and industry, based on pro- moting local employment and economic development, and accelerating the transfer of skills and resources.\nThe advantages of this link are undoubtedly tangible for both sides: For the University, it facilitates the connection with the world of work and facilitates the integration of young people into it; offering students managerial experi- ence; illustrating the skills and professionalism appropriate to the needs of the world of work; offering opportunities for theses, internships and work placements. For the com- pany, it allows for the scouting of young talent and their training, it also allows the identification and promotion of activities that enable the various training courses to cor- respond to the innovation and development needs of com- panies; accelerating the transfer of knowledge and skills.\nws\naa\na >\n=\n164 CREATING VALUE\nry\n~ a\nMe +h Can ds ee\n5.

In this general framework, it is essential for us to interact with the local educational and academic sector at various levels as interlocu- tors dedicated to educating the future operators, decision makers and opinion leaders of the socio-economic devel- opment of regions and of the energy transition in particular, making our ex- pertise as an industrial player available whenever possible.\nEDUCATION & TRAINING\nfor the new generations\nOUTCOMES & IMPACTS\nto activate social change\nThat is why in recent years we have focused our giving initiatives in ed- ucation and higher education, and for 2022 we have followed the same course of action with a specific focus on fair and gender balanced access to training opportunities.\nFor this approach to work, we believe it is essential to adopt a direction that is both strategic, because it is con- sistent with corporate strategies and focused in business-related areas, and transformative, because it is aimed at\nTg =\nSina!\nF,\nay, hooey\nMele\ney\nTBs,\ni\nA\nc\nLeong 9\na\nWe pa Sif\nrer Fs\nen are\ney on a z\naf\n*\n1”\n=, i\ncass,\neu\neer\n= io\nai\nhe\nai\nif\ni\nrr;\nf\n1.

To enable the ener- gy transition and the circular economy, it is essential to support technological and plant innovation through a pro- cess of education and information to help understanding. Dialogue with local stakeholders thus takes on new forms, beyond consensus-building, but edu- cational and listening, functional to the path of decarbonisation and enabling the circular economy.\nIn line with the objectives of the new sustainability strategy, the Group has become the promoter of a new initia- tive. Dialogue with the local area is necessary and useful, because it al- lows technologies to be understood in their innovative value and environ- mental benefits, while at the same time allowing local needs to be heard. Stakeholder involvement becomes fun- damental to the achievement of sus- tainable growth objectives in the terri- tories, representing a change of course from traditional industrial culture and a form of innovation in approach and content.

As part of the collaboration with the National Institute of Technology - Karnataka, the interdisciplinary “Maire Tecni- mont Centre for Research on Waste Recycling and Circular Economy” launched in 2021, welcomed additional student fellows also in 2022. Students can take advantage of the bio-gas pilot plant, built at the NITK campus in 2020 thanks to our Group’s contribution, which has now become a complementary university research facility. Both the cen- tre and the pilot plant were opened for visits by secondary school students from schools in the vicinity of the campus, during which the fellows explained the centre’s activities, the features of the pilot plant and the research being done on energy transition issues.\nOpportunities for upgrading the pilot plant and its replica- bility in other areas of India close to the regions where the Group has a business presence are being assessed.\nIN ITALY FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF TECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS\ni With a view to developing pro-\nenergy transition at all levels, the opportunity to support the training of young people in tech- nical institutes is in line with the long-term perspective that embodies the corporate giving work of our Group. To support local organisations in Italy that promote the professional development of younger generations in challenging social contexts, in 2022 we supported the Ettore Molinari Technological Institute in Milan, which has received national recognition for its achievements. As a Group we donated the glassware of the school’s in-house chemistry laboratory to the Institute, and as a Foundation we supported the organisation of the 20th National Chemistry Competition that the school hosted as the winner of the previous competition. Our Foun- dation also promoted orienteering and training courses in several technical and high schools to introduce the engineering sector, and the role of technicians and en- gineers as designers of the energy transition\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 169\nCSR INITIATIVES IN INDIA FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION",

This comprises revenues from sales and services and changes in contract work in progress. In accordance with the requirements of Annex | of the Delegated Act 2021/4987, the Group considered only revenues related to eligible and aligned economic activi- ties for the numerator. To collect this data, the administrative and account- ing functions of each Group company within the scope of the EU Taxonomy extracted the data directly from the management information system. Tak- ing a project-based approach, the ac- counting material that guided the data collection process for the numerator of the Turnover KPI were the techni- cal contracts of the Maire Tecnimont Group’s subsidiaries recognised for 2022.

This is particularly evident in the essential use of personnel in engineering new plants for clients or in revamping existing plants. Therefore, each asset on which the Group’s activ- ity is carried out entails a limited pres- ence, from an accounting point of view, of tangible or intangible fixed assets in the assets of the balance sheet, given they constitute revenues for the Group, at the time of sale to the client.

Specifically, the numerator of the Turnover KPI mainly comprises revenues generated by the Group’s in- dividual business units: the E&C and Sustainable Technologies business units. Following the same approach used to comment on the consolidated financial results, the turnover KPls will be analysed accordingly.\n\nUnder the Regulation’s guidelines, the denominator of the Group’s OpEx KPI was 57,904.09 thousand euros. For the numerator, the approach used to identify the operating cost items as- sociated with eligible and aligned ac- tivities was based on a detailed anal- ysis of each company’s management income statement, in order to select only those accounting items specifi- cally related to the categories speci- fied by the Regulation.\nIn particular, for each cost element identified in paragraph 1.1.3.2 of the Annexes to Commission Delegated Act (EU) 2021/4987 of 6 July 2021 supple- menting Regulation (EU) 2020/852, an analysis was carried out on the items in the management income statement. This led to the following being included for point A of the OpEx KPI - “costs related to assets or processes associ- ated with economic activities aligned to the Taxonomy” (see Taxonomy of revenue-generating activities):\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n> “Maintenance\nexpenses”, mainly re- lated to work on plants and applica- tion packages; “Research and development ex- penses”, allocated to the various cost items using the number of hours devoted to the activities as a driver. These expenses, derived from the income statement items relating to eligible activities and stripped of intercompany items, were broken down into non-capi- talised staff costs, raw materials and consumables used, consultan- cy services, share of leased equip- ment, and share of start-up costs; “Short-term leases”, comprising short-term leases, rentals and leas- es of equipment/cars used by em- ployees in the performance of eligi- ble and aligned activities; “Day-to-day servicing of assets” considered in the sense of costs for cleaning plants, identified as the only tangible assets for a Group whose core business is the sale of engineering services.\nFurthermore, in relation to point C of the OpEx KPI - “costs related to the purchase of output from Taxono- my-aligned economic activities and to individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions” - the Maire Tecnimont Group mainly in- cluded “maintenance expenses” relat- ed to the following economic activities: > Activity 6.5 - Transport by mo- torbikes, passenger cars and light\ncommercial vehicles\n3.

The “Sustainable Technolo- gy Solutions” unit accounted for about 3% of revenues.\n\nDetermining the components of the numerator required a more granular level of analysis for the purposes of identifying the share of increases in the value of tangible and intangible as- sets that were related to eligible and aligned activities; the denominator, however, was calculated at a higher level, as it is the sum of both eligible/ non-eligible, aligned/unaligned compo- nents. This work led to the breakdown of increases in 2022 by tangible and intangible assets and rights of use (ac- cording to IFRS 16). This included com- ponents specifically related to business combinations that occurred during the year. The values taken into account were selected without considering the effects of amortisation, depreciation, write-downs and changes in fair value, as required by the Regulation.\n\nWhile the numerator was derived using a purely managerial approach to iden- tify the components for each eligible contract under the Regulation, a more elaborate approach was followed for the denominator. For costs related to Research and Development activities, the management income statement was taken as the reference, focusing on the “R&D costs” item, excluding the part related to the management of these projects, as clarified by FAQ #1 published by the European Commis- sion in February 2022. The figure for maintenance costs was derived from an analysis of the consolidated income statement by identifying the (i) “main- tenance” and (ii) “maintenance of ap- plication packages” items as sub-items of the financial statement item “costs for services”. The concept of “routine maintenance of assets” - indicated by\nthe Taxonomy as a component that can be included in the calculation of the relevant KPI - was associated with the costs of “cleaning/disinfection ser- vices” as a sub-item of the “Costs for services” income statement item.",

In 2022, there was a slight increase in the unit values of water consumption compared to 2021. This increase was due to the different mix of phases for the con- struction sites in question, particularly for the subsidiaries KT - Kinetics Tech- nology S.p.A. and Tecnimont Private Limited.

The remainder downstream of the pro- duction process is treated and subse- quently discharged into the sewerage system in areas considered to be “wa- ter stressed”.\n194 CREATING VALUE\nIn 2022 waste production fell. This was mainly due to a substantial reduction in internal reorganisation and restructur- ing activities and the creation of work- stations at the subsidiary Tecnimont S.p.A. compared to 2021 and 2020. All non-hazardous waste was recycled.\nIt is highlighted that about 69 tonnes of non-hazardous and_ hazardous waste (99.98% of total waste) were recycled.\nThe production of waste is influenced by the work phase of the construction sites over the course of the year and by the mix of countries in which the various construction sites are locat- ed. In 2022 there was an increase in waste compared to 2021, particularly for the subsidiary Tecnimont S.p.A. This was due to the presence in cer- tain projects of significant quantities of material such as excavation soil and rocks, classified as waste according to local regulations. This waste was then recycled in accordance with local laws.\n2021\n237,608\n237,452\n156\n237,608\n174,188\n63,390\n29\nIn addition to the above quantities of waste produced, there are also quanti- ties of waste from the MyReplast plant. In 2020, the waste produced amount- ed to 9,595 tonnes, 12,054 in 2021 and 8,249 tonnes in 2022. The reduc- tion in the value of waste produced in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020 is in line with the plant’s output.\n2022\n99,9%\n68,93 68,95\n=\n2022\n452,268\n452,048\n220\n452,268\n273,514\n67,847\n110,907\n73.3%\n60.5%\n26.7%\n39.5%\nWASTE MANAGEMENT ON CONSTRUCTION SITES\n8.9%\n3.

  "page_104": "=\nReporting\nPrinciples, Period, Objective\nThe Maire Tecnimont Sustainability Re- port, now in its sixth edition, is intend- ed to provide a complete overview of the Group’s activities, impact, commit- ments and objectives in economic-fi- nancial, social and environmental terms. The path that the Group has taken aims to incorporate sustainability into the Group’s commercial strategy itself, as well as into its governance, opera- tions and financial reporting, in line with the Group’s Sustainability Plan, which promotes the Sustainable Development Goals (SGD) established by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda.\nThe document was drawn up in com- pliance with the Global Reporting Ini- tiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards: “In accordance with’. In addition, Maire Tecnimont has aligned itself with the new reporting require- ments for “Consolidated Non-Financial Statements” in accordance with Italian Legislative Decree No. 254 of 30 De- cember 2016, which transposes the 2014/95/EU Directive of the European Parliament and Council into Italian law.\nThe 2023-2032 Business Plan ap- proved by the Board of Directors of Maire Tecnimont includes ESG (en- vironmental, social and governance) sustainability disclosures linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. As of this year, the plan identifies and prioritises material top- ics based on the various business lines and the relevant SDGs. The plan matches economic and financial goals to those related to sustainability, allow- ing for integrated strategic planning.\nScope within the\nOrganisation\nINTRODUCTION\n1. SUSTAINABILITY\nAT MAIRE TECNIMONT\nfrom the perspective of the economic, social and environmental topics identi- fied in the materiality analysis and de- scribed in detail in paragraph 1.7 “Ma- teriality Analysis” of this document. To identify the most pertinent issues, and therefore the content of this Re- port, the opinion of senior managers in the various departments was taken into account, as well as the results of a sector analysis, sustainability mac- ro-trends and other external sources. The objective of the document is also to better inform all stakeholders about the Maire Tecnimont Group’s main eco- nomic, social and environmental results\nThe following table illustrates, for each of the material topics identified, the relative scope both inside and outside the Organisation. There are no limits to the scope of material issues within the Organisation.\nThe reporting process consisted in identifying, for each of the Group’s material topics, the related disclosures necessary to explain the main impacts, activities and performances.\nThe following table shows the correla- tion between the themes related to Legislative Decree 254/2016 and the material topics identified by the Maire Tecnimont Group.\nThe data and information provided in the Sustainability Report refer to the Maire Tecnimont Group, which in turn refers to the entity Maire Tecnimont S.p.A. and to the companies consol- idated on a line-by-line basis in the Group’s Annual Financial Report for 2022. It is noted that:\nthe economic data were taken from the Group’s Annual Financial Report and, as such, in this document also include all the consolidated Group companies; the corporate data include all the companies of the Group consoli- dated on a line-by-line basis in the Annual Financial Report; the data relating to health, safety and the environment (HSE) include\n>\n2. CLIMATE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY,\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nall the companies of the Group, consolidated with the integral method in the Annual Financial Re- port, as well as their data, including related construction sites. Where the companies of the Maire Tecni- mont Group have the role of main contractor, the figures concerning them also include sub-contractor data; any further exceptions to the re- porting scope are indicated in the individual sections. The Group’s Sustainability Report is published annually and circulated us- ing the communication tools normally used by the Group.\n\nTo ensure the Sustainability Report is accessible to all stakeholders, this Report uses clear, complete and con- cise language and includes images and graphics. The disclosures presented in the Report refer to the period between 01/01/2022 and 31/12/2022. Where possible, comparisons with the previ- ous year are provided and progress is reviewed to better explain and high- light any significant changes.\n\nThe data is presented in an objective and systematic way. The disclosures describe the performance of the relat- ed reporting period.\n\nThe data presented in this Report have been verified by the Heads of each De- partment, in order to guarantee data integrity. Where possible, the data extracted from the Maire Tecnimont Group’s 2022 Annual Financial Report, drawn up in compliance with “IAS” in- ternational accounting standards, have been included in the Report.\n\nThe Sustainability Report is published annually.

Our audit firm adopts International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations.\nAuditor’s responsibilities\nWe are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) — Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (“ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\nThe procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, analyses of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain evidence considered useful.\nIn detail, we performed the following procedures:\n1\nanalysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standard adopted; analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to assess their compliance with the Decree; comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with the information reported in the Group’s consolidated financial statements; understanding of the following matters:\nbusiness and organisational model of the Group with reference to the management of the matters specified by article 3 of the Decree;\ne\n214 CREATING VALUE\n2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 215",

In detail, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Maire Tecnimont SpA and with the personnel of Tecnimont SpA and KT -— Kinetics Technology SpA and we performed limited analyses of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial information to the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS. Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group at a group level: a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with available evidence; b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of the information. For the following companies Maire Tecnimont SpA, Tecnimont SpA and KT - Kinetics Technology SpA and for the sites of New Delayed Coking Complex for the Rijeka Refinery, Rijeka, Croatia, Modernization Baku Oil Refinery - Haor Project, Baku, Azerbaijan e Urea, UAN Plant, Gemlik, Turkey, which were selected on the basis of their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and their location, we carried out site visits during which we met local management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct application of the procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators.\nConclusion\nBased on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of Maire Tecnimont Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards.\n=\nAPPENDIX\n3.
