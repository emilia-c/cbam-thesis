  "page_2": "The paper in a nutshell\nThe paper studies how monetary policy should be conducted during the green transition\nIt uses a closed-economy DSGE framework with a green and a dirty sector to analyze if the\ntransition is inflationary and how monetary policy should respond to the effects of climate policies\non inflation\nIt finds that carbon tax generates upward pressures on inflation if prices in the dirty sector\nare more flexible than prices in the rest of the economy\nBut the transition is not necessarily inflationary: the central bank can keep inflation close to\ntarget if it accepts a cost in terms of widening output gap. The cost can be large if wages are sticky\nResults are robust to alternative model specifications and do not depend on I-O interlinkages\nIMF | European Department",
  "page_3": "Siti EE ae\nIt is a topical paper tackling a question that is very much in the minds of policymakers, financial market participants and practitioners\nIt is built in steps. It explains the basic intuition behind the results in a relatively simple framework and runs two further variants of the model with growing complexity to check the robustness of the findings, including a network economy realistically calibrated on US data\nIt has a strong potential to effectively inform policymaking\nThe emphasis on the importance of relative price stickiness in determining the tradeoffs faced by the central bank is an original contribution. The role of wage stickiness in affecting the size of the inflation-output tradeoff faced by monetary policy is another important contribution\nThere is high potential for future research using the same modelling framework by exploring angles that are currently not pursued",
  "page_4": "Closed economy model: no trade or financial interactions with the rest of the world\nFocus on transition policies: the model does not study the physical effects of climate change\nProduction uses only labor, no capital in the model: green investment and how transition\npolicies can affect capital accumulation in the green and dirty sectors are not studied\nNo financial sector: impact of transition policies on the financial sector and the transmission of\nmonetary policy is not studied\nNo feedback between emissions and macro variables: e.g., no impact of climate risks on r*. But\nthis is fine given the focus on the length of the monetary policy horizon, which is typically much shorter than the long horizon with which climate policies affect emissions",
  "page_5": "Key implication of the model for policy-making: treat inflationary push from the green transition as\nan ordinary cost-push shock\nTextbook recommendation for cost-push shock: if the shock is transitory and there is no evidence of\nsecond-round effects, monetary policy can focus on the medium term and “look through” the shock\nBut carbon pricing will instill a persistent trend in certain inflation components. Looking through the\nshock may imply a prolonged deviation of inflation from target and an unusually long “medium term”\nover which price stability will be restored. Any impact on credibility?\nIn practice, wages may not be fully flexible, expectations may be backward looking. Can the model\nsay anything on the optimal course of monetary policy when there are frictions in the economy? Under what conditions can the CB no longer “look through” the shock and must act against the\ninflation upswing caused by the transition?",
  "page_6": "But the inflationary impact of the carbon tax presumably depends also on how the revenues\ncollected from the tax are recycled back in the economy\n@ Paper assumes neutral fiscal policy: tax revenues are handed out back to households\nHow would the conclusion change if the tax was a sunk cost or if revenues were used to reduce another distortionary tax? It would be interesting to add a more thorough discussion on this\nIs the green transition inflationary?\nThe paper finds that the green transition does not need to imply higher inflation, but it can\ngenerate a tradeoff between price and output stabilization, which can be steep\nThe tradeoff depends\ne Relative stickiness of prices in the dirty and clean sectors of the economy @ Type of climate policy adopted (carbon tax or green subsidy) @ “Sweet spot” (no tradeoff) when prices are fully flexible and when dirty and clean goods are equally sticky\ne",
