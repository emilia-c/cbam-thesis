The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is expected to \"better integrate value chains that are key to the green and digital transition\", and to develop a long-term partnership. \"Together, we will work to strengthen the integration of our strategic production chains. This concerns the mining of rare earth elements, the production of batteries and green hydrogen,\" the EC President stated. The EU legislative package that aims at strengthening the supply of strategically important raw materials will come at the end of March 2023, Peter Handley, the Commission's Head of Unit for Raw Materials (DG Grow) reportedly said during on the fringes of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh.\nTaxation: The Czech Presidency is putting forward a compromising text on energy\ntaxation, according to a document published by Context. The compromise, that was\ndiscussed on 10 November, introduces new minimum rates of specific taxation for natural\ngas and liquified petroleum gas (LPG), depending on their use (as transport fuels, for\nheating, etc). With the rates set to be valid until the end of 2032, there is a ten-year\ntransition period, during which, states can voluntarily introduce reduced rates for a range of\nfuels and energy.\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM): A \"jumbo\" trialogue on CBAM and the\nSocial Climate Fund could be held in mid-December, Peter Liese, the EU Parliament's\nChair of the committee has reportedly confirmed. So far, a trilogue on CBAM is scheduled\nfor 12 December, according to the Czech Presidency's calendar. As Agence Europe\nreported, negotiators already agree on the governance of CBAM. The scope of the tool is\nstill on the table; free quotas under the ETS, as well. Following the trilogue held on 8\nNovember, a diplomat told Contexte that both the Council and the Parliament want to",
  "page_3": "conclude talks before the end of the year, as the mechanism is supposed to enter into\nforce on 1 January 2023. The trilogue scheduled for mid-December could bring an\nagreement on the text.\nEffort Sharing Regulation (ESR): On 8 November, the Council and the EP reached a\nprovisional agreement on the revision of the ESR, which is one of the Fit for 55 files. The\nregulation sets binding annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for EU member\nstates and currently regulates roughly 60% of EU emissions (including road transport,\nheating of buildings, agriculture, small industrial installations and waste management). As\npart of the deal, each member state will have to ensure every year that they do not exceed\ntheir annual GHG emission allocation, and also a headline emissions reduction target of\n40% by 2030, based on 2005 levels.\nEU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): The third trilogue on the proposal amending\nthe EU ETS was held on 10 November 2022, for negotiators to discuss the scope of the\napplication, the conditions for allocating free allowances and the use of revenues, among\nothers, Contexte reported. Following the meeting, Peter Liese, the Parliament's chief\nnegotiator voiced his disappointment over the \"unsuccessful\" outcome of the talks, with\nMichael Bloss (German MEP, Greens) also noting that the Council \"has shown little will to\nmove towards the Parliament and thus continue to block the process\", Euractiv reported.\nAccording to the so-called four-column document published by Contexte, the\nCouncil would be ready to accept that carbon emissions from incineration activities be\n\"monitored\" from 2024, with the possibility for states to include the sector in their national\ncarbon market from 2026. The EU Executive would still need to carry out an impact\nassessment on the inclusion of the sector at EU level by 2031, which was the EU Council's\noriginal position. A new trilogue could take place on 22 November.\nEnergy Charter Treaty: According to information published by Contexte, the updated EU\nposition outlined in a document to be adopted on 22 November during the Energy Charter\nconference, reads that the EU should not oppose the modernisation of the treaty. The\nlatter was signed in 1994 by 53 parties to enforce cooperation in the energy industry and to\noffer guarantees to Western states looking to do business in post-Soviet states. Its",
  "page_4": "framework provides the ability to investors and companies to sue countries over policy changes that could threaten their business and profits. Several states are now claiming that the ECT's punitive legal protections for fossil fuels could jeopardise their ambitious climate plans.\nState Aid: According to information published by Contexte, a \"high-level\" working lunch\nwas scheduled for 9 November, during which, the note prepared by the three Council\nPresidencies, namely the French, Czech and the upcoming Swedish one, will be\ndiscussed. The experts will touch upon the criteria used to define state aid schemes and\nthe industries in Europe that are in need of protection in case of gas rationing.\nConstruction Products Regulation (CPR): On 7 November, Member-States' experts\ndiscussed a compromise text by the Czech Presidency. The document, published by\nContexte, addresses only a few articles related to definitions and products that fall within\nthe scope of the performance, marking, safety and durability obligations proposed by the\nEC in its revision, without amending the obligations at this stage. It also suggests that the\nregulation does not apply to systems treating waste water.\nIn the European Parliament, according to a provisional timetable issued by the\nParliament's IMCO committee, lawmakers are expected to discuss the draft Report by\nChristian Doleschal (EPP), on 28-29 November 2022. MEPs would then have until 6\nDecember 2022 to table amendments to the Rapporteur’s text.\nEcodesign on Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR): In the European Parliament,\nMEPs have until 15 November to table amendments to the draft opinion of the IMCO committee, which is then expected to vote on the document and any amends in April 2023. The ITRE Committee Rapporteur is developing a draft Opinion on the Commission’s proposal, with the committee then expected to discuss the expected draft Opinion, once published, on 28 November 2022. Following this, lawmakers will have until 1 December to submit any amendments.\nProtection of the environment through criminal law: The Council’s Working Party on",

The high-level meeting was also attended\nby Mrs. Olga Algayerova, Executive Secretary, UNECE and Mr. Yuwei Lee, Director,\nSustainable Transport Division, UNECE.\nDuring its intervention, FEAD explained how the introduction of rules that take into account\nthe specific nature of waste as a dangerous good in the ADR provide the legal certainty\nneeded for the waste management industry to work efficiently, closing material loops\nand steering Europe towards a circular and low carbon economy. The WP.15 approved the\ncircular economy as a fixed agenda point for their meetings. Relevant points in terms of\ncircular economy for the WP.15 were for example, the possibility to use recycled\npackaging for transport as well as the transport of waste batteries.\nYou can find the meeting's agenda here and FEAD's presentation here.\n1 5-16 November, Rotterdam: Public conference on Paper and Plastic recycling\n— FEAD representative to be a speaker\n16 November, Brussels: 6\" meeting of the ADR - Informal Working Group on the\nTransport of Hazardous Waste, dedicated to the transport of asbestos waste in\nbulk.\n30 November, online: ECHA Workshop on the Forum pilot project on Recovered\nSubstances exempted from REACH registration - FEAD representative to be a\nspeaker.",
