The Commission acted on its target to achieve at least 25% reduction in administrative burdens, and at least 35% for SMEs until the end of this mandate. If adopted and implemented as set out today, the proposals are conservatively estimated to bring total savings in annual administrative costs of around €6.3 billion and to mobilise additional public and private investment capacity of €50 billion to support policy priorities.\nThis first ‘Omnibus' package will bring simplification to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), Taxonomy Regulation, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n2. Applicability\nThe current Omnibus package is composed by 4 main legislative proposals. These proposals will be discussed, likely amended, and approved by both the Parliament and Council.\n1) Legislative changes to CSRD, CSDDD: to be applied 12 months after entry into force. 2) Legislative changes to CBAM: directly applicable once it enters into force. 3) New, delayed applicability dates for CSRD (waves 2 and 3 to report in 2028 and 2029 instead of 2026 and 2027) and CSDDD (first companies in scope from 2028 instead of 2027) to be applied from 31 December 2025.",
