  "page_2": "28 October 2020\nIntroduction\nThe American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union (AmCham EU) is committed to the values of global and free trade. We recognise the need for urgent action to achieve a lower-carbon economy, mitigate climate change and remain committed to supporting the objectives detailed in the Paris Agreement. Our member companies are willing to play an active role in this transition and have been researching, investing in and developing a wide range of lower-carbon technologies in Europe for decades.\nThe introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) presents both challenges and opportunities for the business communities to play a constructive role in facilitating a low-carbon transition in Europe and across the globe. We acknowledge the challenge of maintaining the competitiveness of manufacturing production in jurisdictions with strong climate ambitions in the absence of equivalent measures in other jurisdictions of the global economy. In this regard, we strongly encourage the European Commission to closely engage with third countries during the development of the CBAM to generate global consensus with key trading partners and with like-minded countries with high climate ambitions to avoid unnecessary trade tensions and to minimise any negative impacts on international trade.\nThe success of a future CBAM will be largely dependent on thorough Impact Assessments. The results of which should be clearly communicated to the public and impacted stakeholders. AmCham EU believes that transparency is a prerequisite for data-driven, science-based policymaking and is essential to create the most efficient, economically viable and effective solutions to address climate change.\nAmCham EU and its member companies have the required expertise to contribute to the policy debate and we welcome opportunities to engage in the discussion on the best possible policies to encourage low emission production and to support a fair and level playing field.\nBelow we have detailed our perspectives on the following: objectives of CBAM; the design of the mechanism; Scope; WTO compatibility; potential exemptions and the calculation of carbon content of products.\nObjective of the CBAM (Q4)\nThe European Commission’s proposal for a European Green Deal is an important political milestone and delivering on the EU’s objectives will require equally ambitious policy and regulatory frameworks as well as adequate financial resources. The world has seen cosmic changes over the last several months due to the COVID- 19 crisis and in Europe we now look towards economic recovery from the impact of the pandemic and beyond. We encourage the Commission to strike the right balance between economic recovery and environmental protection.\nThe introduction of CBAM is a key component of the Green Deal and, similarly to other proposals within the Green Deal, CBAM should be clearly defined in terms of the objectives, pathway towards a future mechanism and detail on how the revenue will be used to support climate ambitions. The Commission has emphasised that a CBAM should be fair and promote a level playing field while incentivising the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, we underscore that the primary objective of CRAM must be to address climate change by avoiding the risk of carbon leakage. This would be important not only to avoid discrimination against foreign companies when introducing the CBAM, but also to defend such measure under GATT Article XX (General Exceptions).\nx * %\nad SA\nx\n*\nAmCham EU\nSPEAKING FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS IN EUROPE\nAmCham EU response to the Consultation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism",
  "page_3": "28 October 2020\nThese objectives will require a clear framework that balances sustainability, competitiveness and innovation. Such a framework should encourage industry to invest in solutions that meet societal needs and consumer demands. Any framework should be clearly defined by the following:\nA CBAM must be implemented in coordination with all relevant areas of EU policy and regulatory competence in order to make the EU more attractive to foreign investment and to avoid the risk of undermining industrial competitiveness while ensuring equal opportunity for global market players. Implementation should take into account sectors where environmental and climate regulations and policies are already in place. As per above, the primary objective of CBAM should be to address climate change so there shouldn’t be double taxation. CBAM revenues should be used for the development and deployment of climate change mitigation initiatives and technologies. AmCham EU encourages the Commission to set out a revenue distribution policy to ensure that the CBAM is socially just and does not disproportionally impact low-income households. AmCham EU supports the EU’s leadership in global climate negotiations under the framework of the Paris Climate Agreement. Climate change is a global issue that requires international cooperation and this is especially important in the context of the development of the CBAM. We welcome the Commission’s ambition to ensure that the CBAM adopts an inclusive and global approach when it comes to emission reductions and the Commission’s plan to work with other countries on climate change.\nType of CBAM mechanism (Q6)\nA well-designed CBAM can provide an important policy tool to incentivise companies to reduce the emission intensity of their products, provide a level playing-field for domestic industry, and encourage governments globally to increase their climate ambitions.\nAs ageneral principle, AmCham EU believes that a market-based ETS linked approach offers the best option as it is transparent and allows the market to determine the most efficient and effective price level to drive emissions reductions. Such an approach sets a level playing-field for domestic industry and importers, helping to reduce significant risks posed by potential trade tensions and WTO challenges.\nWithout knowing the details around scope, sectors, design, etc, it is challenging to assess the impact and to provide answers that can be applied generally irrespective of the subsequent design choices. AMCham EU would be happy to provide additional comments as further details are known.\nOption 1 (Q6.1): A tax applied on imports at the EU border on a selection of products whose production is in sectors that are at risk of carbon leakage. This could be a border tax or customs duty on selected carbon intensive products. While this design option may be more manageable and feasible to operationalise under certain circumstances, price setting (as opposed to a market-based carbon price) is not transparent and policymakers may be challenged to set the appropriate price level given trade complexity. We do note that this may inadvertently also be the option the most at risk of trade compliance. Option 2 (Q6.2): An extension of the EU ETS to imports. By clearly linking the CBAM to domestic carbon pricing, this mechanism reduces the carbon leakage rate, provides a level playing-field, and incentivises global ambition by encouraging countries to adopt their own carbon pricing policies. By linking the CBAM to the existing climate change legislation, the EU’s emission reduction objectives will be explicit, and it is less likely to be viewed as a protectionist measure by third countries. Given that the EU ETS legislation will be reviewed in the near future, the European Commission may want to consider integrating the CBAM to support energy intensive industries in the event of carbon leakage (article 10B\nx * %\nad SA\nx\n*\nAmCham EU\nAmCham EU response to the Consultation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism\nSPEAKING FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS IN EUROPE\n3",
  "page_4": "28 October 2020\n1(B) of the EU ETS Directive). AmCham EU members believe that this design option is the most relevant option for the Commission to consider. This design option could be easier to implement for those sectors that are already compliant under the EU ETS.\nHowever, the Commission should note that this design option may result in increased complexity and require additional resources if applied to sectors outside the scope of the existing EU ETS. The Commission should also take into account potential disruption of the EU ETS if they choose to extend the EU ETS to importers. Option 3 (Q6.3): The obligation to purchase allowances from a specific pool outside the ETS dedicated to imports, which would mirror the ETS price. This design option could be effective. However, to avoid global trade tensions and survive WTO challenges, it is critical that the price for the ‘mirror pool’ be exactly the same price as the domestic ETS. Option 4 (Q6.4): Carbon tax (eg, excise or VAT type) at consumption level on a selection of products whose production is in sectors that are at risk of carbon leakage. Under this option, the tax would apply to EU production, as well as to imports. Such a carbon tax would not change the relative economics of imports versus EU production as it would apply to both. Hence, it would not resolve the issue of carbon leakage and could lead to double taxation of EU industry. If collected at the border and not at the time of sales, a carbon tax could also generate significant complexity in global supply chains, and less transparency for importers or customers. As such, AmCham EU does not recommend the European Commission consider this design option for the EU’s CBAM.\nSectors subject to the CBAM (Q9)\nWhen designing the CBAM, AmCham EU urges the Commission to assess various factors in a holistic manner and select targeted sectors based on transparent, predictable and science-based criteria. In particular, it would be important for the Commission to assess:\ne whether products are exposed to the high risks of carbon leakage; e whether the EU has emission benchmarks and data that have already been established within the EU; e whether products have a simple supply chain; e whether trade volume of EU’s imports of selected products is high or low;\nWe strongly urge the Commission to focus on a few material sectors with simple supply chains to ensure that the mechanism is well-designed and well-functioning. In addition, once the Commission has chosen targeted sectors, it will be important for the Commission to provide a sufficient transitional period to lessen the economic hardship caused by COVID-19 and thus to provide enough time for the affected industries to make necessary arrangements. In so doing, we urge the Commission to communicate with the affected industries and trading partners to minimise potential negative impacts of the CBAM.\nAmCham EU recommends that the Commission conducts a thorough review after implementing CBAM initially on selected sectors to fully understand its effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and impact on the affected industries. If the Commission intends to expand the scope of the CBAM after a few years of the initial application, we strongly urge the Commission to provide specific timelines and details on criteria for expanding the scope in advance. In any case such extensions should be subject to the legislative procedure and should not be left to delegated acts.\nWTO compatibility\nAmCham EU is committed to the values of global and free trade. The design of the CBAM should avoid trade conflicts and inadvertently disrupting highly integrated supply chains. Any mechanism to promote carbon-\nx * %\nad SA\nx\n*\nAmCham EU\nAmCham EU response to the Consultation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism\nSPEAKING FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS IN EUROPE",
  "page_5": "28 October 2020\nneutral domestic production must be WTO compatible, especially with regard to the principle of non- discrimination, and consider the broader ramifications of impact to supply chains and highly integrated manufacturing production.\nAmCham EU warmly welcomes the Commission’s emphasis that the CBAM will be fully compatible with WTO rules. However, the CBAM’s compatibility with WTO rules will be determined by details of the measure and the actual text of the legislative proposal. We strongly urge the Commission to deliver the CBAM that is compatible with WTO rules, in particular, the non-discrimination principle under the GATT Article III (national treatment). The CBAM must not be used as a protectionist measure. Foreign products manufactured with low greenhouse gas emissions must not face discrimination versus EU products.\nPotential exemptions (Q14)\nAmCham EU strongly urges the Commission to provide CBAM exemptions to countries who have similar climate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We understand that the Commission is currently assessing whether and how the exemptions could be provided and we welcome this consideration.\nProviding CBAM exemptions to countries with climate measures similar to the EU ETS would not only help the EU to achieve the main objective of the CBAM, which is to fight global climate change and to encourage other countries to join the EU’s efforts, but also to avoid unilateral retaliation by other countries in response to the CBAM. For other countries to be eligible for the exemptions, it would be sufficient if their climate measures are similar to the EU ETS in nature, market-based, and significantly contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These criteria should be well-defined, transparent and clear, to ensure predictability for third countries and importing companies and sectors. Further, it is worth noting that providing exemptions to countries implementing measures similar to the EU ETS would be necessary for the Commission to design a WTO-compatible CBAM and to justify the CBAM under GATT Article XX (in particular, to meet the requirement of the chapeau of GATT Article XX).\nCalculating the carbon content of products (Q10)\nAmCham EU members believe that the Commission should aim to include the broadest scope of emissions possible as this is critical to ensure the successful functioning of the mechanism. Ignoring important parts of the supply chain could result in loopholes, resource shifting and undermine the credibility of the mechanism. With this in mind, AmCham EU supports the inclusion of direct and indirect emissions. However, it is important that the design takes into account the potential for burdensome and complex calculation and reporting requirements, especially when it comes to scope 3 emissions. In addition, we recommend that the Commission takes into account the risk of double taxation that could arise from the life cycle-approach. For instance, road and air freight are already paying their emissions dues through road charging and tax on fuels as well as through ETS and Corsia respectively. AmCham EU members will be able to provide additional comments on how best to ensure a practical, efficient and holistic approach to GHG calculations as more details of the design and implementation of the mechanism are released.\nMost importantly, it is critical that the CBAM provide incentives for industries to deliver the lowest-carbon intensity products possible. Without incorporating value chain carbon intensity into the CBAM, individual firms are not incentivised to undertake efforts to reduce their own carbon intensity. Similarly, measuring carbon intensity at an industry or national level for a given product would actually discourage private sector action as investments in lowering carbon intensity are not rewarded and would put firms at a competitive disadvantage against those not spending capital to reduce emissions intensity. A CBAM that takes firm-level carbon intensity into account is uniquely able to encourage industries to reduce the carbon intensity of their goods by rewarding improvements by firms across the value chain.\nx * %\nad SA\nx\n*\nAmCham EU\nSPEAKING FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS IN EUROPE\n5\nAmCham EU response to the Consultation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism",
  "page_6": "28 October 2020\nTo avoid complexity in the initial phase of the CBAM, the Commission may consider providing a default value for the carbon intensity of imports (using EU benchmarks or by type of products), while allowing the importer to be able to provide sufficient evidence for the actual carbon intensity of the product in a timely and efficient manner. This would provide the flexibility required to incentivise investments in emissions reductions, while reducing the accounting burden for importers.\nEnforcement\nAmCham EU stresses that proper enforcement of any measure is critical to its effectiveness and the credibility of the Green Deal. There are many examples where duties or other controls are circumvented or avoided by re- routing shipment to alter the origin of the goods, misclassification under the customs nomenclature, abuse of transit arrangements, etc. For example, there is substantial illegal trade in hydrofluorocarbons, powerful greenhouse gases subject to strict controls in the EU. Other examples include goods subject to specific trade controls (agricultural products, goods subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duties or quantitative restrictions).\nAmCham EU suggests that the Chief Trade Enforcement Officer (CTEO), a new post created by the Commission to strengthen the enforcement of EU trade agreements, monitor the enforcement of the CBAM. As the CTEO is expected is to enforce the sustainable development commitments of EU trade agreements among other responsibilities, the CTEO could monitor and secure the enforcement of the CBAM. This would be particularly relevant if the Commission considers the customs duties or tariff design options (Q6.1) for the CBAM.\nx * %\nad —\nEe\nx\n*\nAmCham EU\nSPEAKING FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS IN EUROPE\nAmCham EU response to the Consultation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism 6",

The long-term objective of climate neutrality by 2050 will be enshrined in legislation and the Commission will propose to increase the EU’s climate ambition to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by 50-55% from 1990 levels by 2030.\nIn this context, the European Green Deal emphasized that “should differences in levels of ambition worldwide persist, as the EU increases its climate ambition, the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism, for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage”. Risk of carbon leakage means either that production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or that EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports. If this risk materialises, there will be no reduction in global emissions, and this will frustrate the efforts of the EU and its industries to meet the global climate objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nA Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) would ensure that the price of imports reflects more accurately their carbon content. This measure will be designed to comply with World Trade Organization rules and other international obligations of the EU. This measure would be an alternative to the current free allocation of allowances or compensation for the increase in electricity costs that address the risk of carbon leakage, because of carbon pricing in the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS). Since 2005, the EU Emissions Trading System has been a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial and power sectors, by setting up a carbon market based on a 'cap and trade' principle. The system works by putting a limit on overall emissions from covered installations, which is reduced each year. Within this limit, companies can buy and sell emission allowances as needed, while some allowances are provided for free to certain industries on the basis of harmonised rules.\nOn 27 May 2020, the European Commission set out a Recovery Plan for Europe in response to the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of this plan, a new recovery instrument has been put forward by the Commission, with the proposal that the necessary funds be raised by temporarily lifting the EU’s own resources ceiling. In this context, green own resources could contribute to future financing of the EU budget while supporting the green transition of the European economy and society. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is one of the possible options mentioned in the Recovery Plan for Europe in this context.",
