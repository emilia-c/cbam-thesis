  "page_3": "INTRODUCTION\nIn October of 2021, the United States and the European Union announced their intent to negotiate a “Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum” (Global Arrangement) that would restrict market access for high carbon intensity steel and aluminum.\" As an initial step, the parties agreed to form a technical working group to “confer on methodologies for calculating steel and aluminum carbon-intensity and share relevant data.”* There have been similar calls from private sector initiatives for international coordination on procedures for determining carbon intensity—particularly with regard to steel.°\nThere is little agreement, however, on how this coordination would work and what form it would take. This paper outlines an approach for coordinating product-level emissions accounting procedures for steel under the Global Arrangement to provide for both flexibility and interoperability, reducing the burden on covered manufacturers in generating emissions intensity data that would comply with both U.S. and EU requirements. Most proposals for promoting interoperability of standards focus ona “vertical,” top-down system based on international standards.* Although agreement on international standards for determining emissions intensity would be optimal, it appears unlikely that such standards will be approved at the multilateral level in the near future.\nWe propose as an alternative a “horizontal” approach linking the methodologies that are already being developed in the U.S. and the EU. For the EU, the obvious starting point is the procedures for determining embedded emissions under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).° For the United States, the reference point is the approach being developed by the International Trade Commission (ITC) for determining the carbon intensity of steel. The ITC investigation is much more limited in scope than the CBAM, aimed only at determining the average and highest emissions intensity of U.S. steel and aluminum production.’ Nonetheless, the ITC’s methodology provides an adequate basis for identifying potential avenues toward interoperability with the EU’s approach under the CBAM. In the discussion below, we propose an approach combining three tools of international regulatory cooperation’—harmonization, mutual recognition, and horizontal consultation procedures—to align emissions accounting for steel in the U.S. and the EU, while permitting flexibility for variation among systems where necessary or appropriate.\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel",
  "page_4": "l. HARMONIZATION\nFull harmonization of regulatory standards from different countries is rare due to differences in legal processes and political priorities.° As one commentator has noted:\nharmonization . . . can be cumbersome, less responsive to local priorities and contexts, and less subject to learning from experimentation. Harmonization of existing regulations is also unattractive to industry and regulators where they have sunk significant investment in compliance with existing standards. '°\nAccordingly, it is unlikely that the U.S. and EU will, at least in the near term, adopt precisely the same emissions intensity accounting procedures. A more viable approach would be to require harmonization of only those elements of emissions accounting systems that must be uniform in order to be interoperable, while accommodating unavoidable variations. Critically, the system should provide clarity regarding any differences between U.S. and EU emissions intensity standards, by using a harmonized reporting template, measurement unit, and taxonomy of emissions.\nHarmonization of other elements, including covered gases, system boundaries, and procedures for measurement or calculation of emissions, would be desirable, particularly if the intent is to develop a harmonized substantive policy—e.g., a shared system of import fees based on the emissions intensity of products like the Global Arrangement. Some variation on these issues, however, could be accommodated and made transparent through the reporting template. And deeper alignment on these elements could be pursued through the mutual recognition and consultation mechanisms discussed in Sections II and Ill.\nREPORTING TEMPLATE\nThe same basic template for reporting product-level emissions data should be used in both the U.S. and the EU, even if there is some variation in the emissions covered. To accommodate any variation in covered gases or system boundaries, the reporting template could provide “line items” for different gases and emissions sources (e.g., additional material inputs) that would permit the determination of emissions intensity under different standards.\nUNIT OF MEASUREMENT\nThe basic unit of measurement used for emissions should be harmonized to ensure interoperability. The U.S. approach\" and the EU approach’? for determining embedded emissions are harmonized on this point, both measuring emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (tCOze).\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel",
  "page_5": "TAXONOMY OF EMISSIONS\nHarmonization of the taxonomy of covered emissions—i.e., the categories or scopes of emissions that are included—is essential to ensuring interoperability. Ideally this would include both the categories themselves and the terminology used to describe those categories, although any differences in terminology could be addressed through clear definitions of the terms and relevant categories.\nThe EU uses the categories of direct emissions, indirect emissions, and emissions from precursors, '? while the ITC uses the scope 1, 2, and 3 taxonomy in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.'* That said, there is still significant overlap in these classifications. '°\nDirect emissions under the CBAM and Scope 7 emissions under the ITC investigation both include the emissions associated with fuel combustion within the facility. Indirect emissions and Scope 2 emissions both include the emissions associated with purchased electricity. Emissions from precursors and Scope 3 emissions both include the emissions associated with the production of upstream inputs within the system boundaries of each respective policy framework (see Table 1).\nThere are, however, discrepancies between the classification systems used by each party. Direct emissions under the CBAM include emissions from the production of heating and cooling, while these emissions are assigned to scope 2 emissions under the ITC investigation. Indirect emissions according to the EU framework include emissions associated with in-facility electricity production, but these emissions are assigned to scope 1 emissions in the U.S. framework (see Table 1).\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel",

The EU CBAM requires reporting of only COz emissions for iron and steel.24 The ITC’s proposed methodology, in contrast, indicates that it will cover methane (CHa) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in addition to COz, as specified under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) for large emitting facilities .2°\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel",
  "page_7": "SYSTEM BOUNDARIES\nThe U.S. and EU system boundaries are closely aligned for iron and steel products.”6 Most notably, the system boundaries of the U.S. and EU approaches both include the three major baskets of emissions: combustion emissions (direct/scope 1), emissions from electricity produced off-site (indirect/scope 2), and a limited set of upstream emissions (precursors/scope 3).\nBoth the U.S. and EU system boundaries for iron and steel exclude emissions from the mining process at the beginning of the supply chain. Both system boundaries also specify common upstream materials that need to be monitored and reported, which are referred to as “precursors” by the CBAM and as “intermediate products” by the ITC investigation. There is, however, a difference in the way that emissions embodied in these upstream inputs are counted that could be reflected in the reporting template. While system boundaries refer to the steps of the production process that require monitoring and reporting of emissions, we use the term “precursors” to refer to upstream materials that contribute to the total embedded emissions of an end- product. The EU CBAM’s calculation methodology assigns zero embedded emissions to purchased coke whereas the ITC’s does not, so we consider coke to be a precursor only for the ITC methodology and not for the EU CBAM in Table 2.27\nTable 2: System boundaries for the EU CBAM and USITC Investigation\nThe CBAM language is taken from the EU regulations; ITC terminology is adjusted to illustrate commonalities in the system boundaries (ex. iron sinter > sintered ore).\nEU CBAM\nUSITC Investigation\nSintered ore, pig iron, direct- Sintered ore, pig iron, direct-\nreduced iron, ferrous\nalloys,\nreduced iron, ferrous\nalloys,\nhydrogen, crude steel, and\nhydrogen, crude steel, semi-\nsemi-finished steel\nfinished steel products, and\nproducts.78\ncoke.?9\nThe acceptable methods of measuring or calculating emissions should also be harmonized to the greatest extent possible to ensure that reported data can be compared.°° The EU CBAM and ITC investigation permit slightly different calculation methods.

  "page_9": "ll. MUTUAL RECOGNITION\nBecause of the difficulty of achieving harmonization of international standards, much of the focus of efforts to promote international regulatory cooperation has shifted to mutual recognition.*’ Mutual recognition refers to agreements between countries to recognize elements of each other’s regulatory regimes as legally adequate.* Mutual recognition is most commonly used to provide for the acceptance of the competence of “conformity assessment bodies” (CABs) in participating countries to certify that products produced in one country comply with the standards of another.** These arrangements are implemented through “mutual recognition agreements” (MRAs).*4 The U.S. and the EU have MRAs covering a number of sectors, including telecommunications equipment, pharmaceutical goods manufacturing practices, and medical devices.*°\nThe U.S. and the EU could, accordingly, enter into an MRA addressing mutual recognition of “verifiers” (the term used under the CBAM) of data submitted regarding emissions intensity. Under the CBAM, data submitted regarding emissions intensity will be certified by a verifier that is accredited pursuant to the procedures used for data submitted under the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS).46 The European Commission is authorized to adopt additional guidelines regarding the verification process.*’’ The Commission is also authorized to issue additional rules on accreditation of verifiers, including standards for mutual recognition of accreditation bodies.*® A mutual recognition agreement between the EU and the U.S. regarding accreditation of verifiers would therefore be consistent with the design of the CBAM and permit steel producers in both the U.S. and the EU to use the same verifiers in determining the emissions intensity of traded steel under the Global Arrangement.\nMutual recognition could also be used to address any variation between U.S. and EU approaches to measurement or calculation of data, if they are deemed to be essentially equivalent.49 Mutual recognition, however, is very rare with regard to different regulatory standards,°° and would therefore be less appropriate for addressing any inconsistencies in covered gases or system boundaries if those differences significantly affected the determination of emissions intensity.\nlil. HORIZONTAL COOPERATION MECHANISMS\nIn addition to harmonization and mutual recognition, achieving interoperability of emissions accounting for steel will require procedural mechanisms for consultation, coordination, and information sharing.°' Models for a joint body to carry out these functions include the Western Climate Initiative, Inc. (WCl) for linking subnational emissions trading programs in the U.S. and Canada, and the Joint Committee established to link Switzerland’s and the EU’s emissions trading systems.\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel",
  "page_10": "The WCI is a non-profit corporation created in 2011 to provide technical, administrative, and IT support for developing and implementing the greenhouse gas emissions trading programs of participating jurisdictions, which currently include California, Washington, Nova Scotia, and Quebec.*” The WCI plays a key role in facilitating the operation and governance of California and Quebec’s linked emissions trading systems, providing technical and administrative support, market oversight, policy coordination, capacity building, and stakeholder engagement. However, the WCI does not exert direct authority over the emissions trading systems. Instead, it is a collaborative effort among participants, with “all participating jurisdictions retain[ing] all policy control and full oversight authority over their programs.”°3\nThe WCI requires member jurisdictions to have “rigorous reporting and verification” of GHG emissions, and “consistent methods for emissions reporting, within a sector and across sectors, must be applied by covered entities and is subject to independent third- party verification from accredited auditors.”°* The WCI incorporates elements of both vertical and horizontal approaches to regulatory cooperation, encouraging alignment with both international and national standards including the IPCC Guidelines, ISO Standards (14064), WRI’s GHG Protocol, National Inventories (often based on IPCC guidelines), and Sector-Specific Guidelines (EPA or Environment Canada). In 2010, WCI aimed to harmonize its greenhouse gas reporting requirements with the U.S. EPA’s “Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule” to ease compliance burdens.°* In its effort to harmonize its reporting requirements and the EPA's rule, the WCI released detailed reporting guidelines.°° The WCI builds off the U.S. EPA reporting rule to support an ETS program, providing additional calculations when needed.\nThe Swiss-EU Joint Committee was created by an agreement that entered into force in January 2020.9’ Comprised of representatives from each party, the Joint Committee oversees the regular exchange of information and consultation regarding a party’s development, proposal, or adoption of a legislative act of relevance.*® It also coordinates on implementation of the agreement,°? conducts periodic reviews of major developments in either ETS,®° and settles disputes.®' For each party, the agreement specifies the essential criteria that stationary installations must follow in their monitoring and reporting of emissions.®* The Joint Committee consults and coordinates on any developments concerning either parties’ relevant laws. As with the WCI, the Joint Committee functions in a coordinating capacity, with the EU and Switzerland maintaining control over their respective ETSs.\nA similar joint body could be established by the U.S. and the EU to coordinate and ensure the interoperability of their programs for determining the emissions intensity of traded steel. Specific functions of the body could include promoting harmonization of reporting templates, taxonomies, systems boundaries, and covered gases; mutual recognition of verifiers; and measurement and calculation procedures.\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel",
  "page_11": "CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. and EU approaches to determining the emissions intensity of steel are in many respects already aligned and could be made functionally interoperable using a combination of tools of international regulatory cooperation. Harmonization could be used to align the process for calculating and reporting emissions. A mutual recognition agreement could reduce the cost and compliance burden by eliminating the need for redundant verification procedures. And horizontal cooperation mechanisms, modeled on the WCI and the Switzerland-EU agreement, could be used to facilitate coordination of the U.S. and EU systems for determining emissions intensity.\nAlthough this paper has focused on an approach to interoperability specifically regarding the determination of emissions intensity for steel under the Global Arrangement, it could also be used with other products and with additional countries for compliance with the growing number of policies that will use emissions intensity as a metric for trade measures. For example, climate and trade measures have been proposed or are being developed in Taiwan,®* Canada, Australia,®° South Korea,® Japan,®’ and India.®° By aligning their approaches on steel, the U.S. and the EU have an opportunity as “first movers” to set the model for broader interoperability in product-level emissions measurement systems.\nInteroperability of U.S. and EU Systems for Determining GHG Emissions Intensity of Steel\n10",

The latter country neither gives up nor adapts any safety, health, environment and consumer protection objectives, nor does it have to change any existing procedure for conformity assessment.\nSee also Shaffer, supra, at 405-06 (“although there would be no mutual recognition of standards, the mutual recognition of CABs would permit a CAB within the jurisdiction of one party to assess and certify the conformity of a product to the standards of the other party to the agreement. . . reduc[ing] compliance costs.”)\n44 Article 6.3 of the TBT Agreement, supra, the of MRAs for conformity assessment encourages use procedures: “Members are encouraged, at the request of other Members, to be willing to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of agreements for the mutual recognition of results of each other's conformity assessment procedures.”\n45 See 1997 U.S.-EU MRA.\n46 See CBAM Regulation, Article 8 (“Verification of embedded emissions”) Article 18 (“Accreditation of Verifiers”), and Annex VI (“Verification principles and content of verification reports for the purpose of Article 8”).\n47 Article 8(3),\n48 Article 18(1) & (3).\n49 Shaffer, supra, at 405 (discussing “mutual recognition of standards pursuant to which country must one accept a product from another regardless of the detailed regulatory requirements that other country adopts, provided that country’s regulatory requirements are essentially equivalent.”)\n50 See OECD (2106) at 10:\nthere are only two examples of . . . mutual recognition [of substantive standards] — the EU and Trans-Tasman — and they have been made possible by a uniquely deep form of economic integration and some common institutional framework with responsibilities at high political level.\n51 See Shaffer, supra, at 406.\n52 “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading: A Cost-Effective Solution to Climate Change | WCI, Inc.”, wei-\ninc.org/.\n°3 “Purpose | Our Work.” n.d.
