  "page_6": "2 EXECULIVE SUMMA\nCircularity is an all-encompassing framework, extending beyond simple material recovery to transform material and product design, strategies, systems and business models. The most recent Circularity Gap Report, published in 2022, calculated the global circularity rate as 8.6%.' While circularity rates remain quite low globally, the European Union has set the topic on top of its political agenda, notably with its EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities. Restructuring the economy will result in the emergence of new businesses while obviating some others; this transition is expected to generate 700,000 green jobs in the EU alone by 2030.2\nTurkey's economy has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its investment space lacks a dedicated circularity focus, despite an investment plan devised with the World Bank. A national circular economy roadmap has not been devised yet in Turkey to date; however, “Green Deal Action Plan” announced in July 2021 by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, has considered the implementation of circularity principles in Turkey. As part of Turkey's efforts to integrate the European Union, legal harmonization has been undertaken to match the EU's current legislative frame on waste and circularity issues. WEEE”, ELV? and Batteries Regulation are just some of the regulations that were matched in Turkey. Current efforts such as regulations, education, innovative practices and a zero-waste project have nevertheless led to improve cyclical material flows in the country. Adopting such directives in Turkey has been the primary reason of higher recovery rates in the Automotive and Home Appliances sectors.\nFunded by AFD, a preliminary research was conducted between 2020-2021 on the circularity potential in five sectors of Turkey, with the collaboration of Business Council for Sustainable Development Turkey (SKD), KPMG Turkey and KPMG France. Plastic packaging, textile, home appliances, automotive and construction industries were the five sectors selected for this research, due to their importance in the Turkish economy, their resource-intensive nature, and their strategic imperative in regard to circularity related initiatives such as the Circular Economy Action Plan.\nElektrikli Elektronik\nKontrolu\nin\n'Atik ve Esyalarin Yonetmeligi (AEEE) Turkey ?Omrtint Tamamlamis Araclarin Kontorli Hakkinda Yonetmelik in Turkey 3Atik Pil ve AkUmiulatorlerin Kontrol YOnetmeligi in Turkey\nThis is a research report, in which limited publicly available qualitative and quantitative data from five sectors, complemented by information provided by volunteer companies and academicians, were compiled and assessed. Due to the low quality of the publicly available nation-wide data, sampling studies were carried out with limited amount of information; hence, varying results on circularity potential of the sectors and products were presented in the report. The most important reasons for the dearth of the studies in the field of circularity were determined as lack of regulations, data, policies and awareness. Other reasons for the absence of circular practices include insufficient industry-wide schemes, deficient infrastructure and lack of data and information transparency. While individual firms have started to research and invest into circular technologies and innovations, most companies are still at a nascent stage.\nOn the other hand, one of the most important reasons for boosting circularity in Turkey has been trade. Companies that sell in other markets, particularly Europe, have invested more in circular strategies due to European regulations and competition. As a result, some Turkish companies in the Home Appliances market have become pioneers in the global markets with their intensive R&D investments.\nThe supply chain and customers can either accelerate the transition to a circular economy or impede it and boundaries set by these stakeholders are pivotal. For instance, an organization cannot track or increase the circularity of its products, if the supply chain does not provide necessary data or circular input. As for clients, they tend to impose restrictions derived from a linear consumption model, which limits manufacturers’ circularity performance. Thus, while Some markets and clients can advance circular initiatives (e.g. European market), some may have the opposite effect. Raising awareness, improving regulations in favour of circularity and building labour capacity throughout the value chain is necessary to truly achieve circularity.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey )",
  "page_7": "The use of circular input remains low in most sectors. Lack of certified recycled materials in Turkey plays a big role. Companies avoid uncertified recycled materials due to regulations and quality standards that ensure durability, safety and hygiene. Automotive, Home Appliances, Construction and Plastic Packaging (for food) sectors are strictly regulated in that respect. Similar restraints imposed by lack of certified recycled materials rise in the Home Appliances sector too, since it is integral to use quality materials to manufacture durable goods that can withstand extreme temperatures. If the market has a steady and ample supply of certified recycled materials at a competitive rate, boosting the circularity of input will be possible in many sectors. As for bioplastics, their lack of durability and resilience under certain conditions limit their utility in most sectors and challenges the substitution of traditional plastics.\nDespite important data limitations in terms of available funding, it appears that development banks continue to play an important role as catalysts. Additionally, manufacturers, conglomerates, commercial banks and funds are also shaping the Turkish investment landscape currently. International partnerships with EU Countries and the EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) have contributed to advancing circularity awareness and topics in Turkey, with the Turkey Materials Marketplace and Turkey Circular Economy Platform being one of the most promising projects conducted to date. Funds and financial\nincentives will aid industries and organizations in overcoming the financial\nbarriers in an evolving economy.\nElevating the growth of a circular ecosystem and working towards a Net-Zero\nCarbon nation will\nrequire companies, industries, NGOs, regulators, municipalities, consumers and academic institutions. Circular practices have demonstrated their effectiveness in limiting emissions which makes them an essential component for nations and organizations’ Net-Zero Carbon goals. From capacity building and evolving regulations to awareness campaigns and R&D, a joint initiative and a sweeping roadmap to transform consumption will be integral for limiting GHG emissions.\nthe collaboration of\nThis report details possible easily implemented criteria to assess the circularity potential of a financed project and presents a summary of current actions and identification of possible trends/gaps for future actions. 29 companies from 5\ndifferent sectors participated via surveys; additionally, meetings were held with 15 different companies to evaluate the circularity potential of these 5 industries The circularity calculation methodology was applied on 2 industries and 4 companies from 3 sectors. The circularity ratios, which exclude energy and water cycles, were calculated based on a derivative method that was inspired by the CTI framework methodology developed by WBCSD. It should be noted that the official tool was not utilized for this study since the scope of the tool and the scope of the circularity calculations carried out for this study were not the same. We tabulated the average circularity of the inputs as 7% and output as 13% for the plastic sector while in the textile sector, circularity of inputs was as 16% and outputs as 23% based on the information received from volunteering companies. More industry players would need to contribute to such studies in order to analyse opportunities and barriers in more detail. We hope that this report will serve as a forerunner for future studies regarding circularity in Turkey and in them.\nencourage more companies to participate\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 7",
  "page_8": "3, FOFEWOT\nFor decades now, we have been feeling the ever-growing side effects of our linear economy in our day to day lives, and more recently, our politics and economics As the human population grew, life expectancies increased and consumption levels rose, we demanded more resources without a consideration of the finite capacity of the planet. Whether it be lakes drying up, species going extinct, water-levels rising, air pollution increasing or extended periods of drought, our environment holds all the evidence that we need to take the initiative to change how we live.\nDespite the palpable warnings of unsustainable levels of consumption and the pressure put on natural resources, it was not until recent years that nations came together to take a stand in unity. The Sustainable Development Goals set during the Paris Agreement in 2015 laid out the focus areas of an overarching approach for social, environmental and governance sustainability. Turkey has ratified this agreement on October 2021 and set 2053 as the target year for achieving Net Zero Emissions.\nThis shift in Turkey's position reflects the importance of supporting sustainability initiatives — not just for environmental and social motivations but for international affairs as well. In a world defined by the globalization of economies, countries that fall behind in integrating sustainability measures in their policies will surely face major losses in trades and stakeholder relationships. With an expanding network of firms and countries joining initiatives and pledges triggered by developments such as those in COP26, Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal, major changes in how we consume is on its way. Most recent commitments from COP26 include pledges regarding deforestation, methane, coal, cement, EVs and finance and are bound to transform industries as we know them.\nIn the light of such transformation, circularity principles hold a strategic importance in forsaking linear consumption, combating climate change and eliminating biodiversity loss. Majority of the emissions come from material handling and use-of-products phases; thus, when materials, products and services’ consumption decreases, so will waste and GHG emissions.\nThis project, funded by l'Agence Francaise de Développement and supported by SKD\"’, aims to conduct a preliminary research study of circularity potential by focusing on five major industries in Turkey. During the study, interviews and meetings were held with industry leaders, companies and researchers alongside renowned publications to evaluate and determine risks and opportunities germane to each industry in Turkey. This study consists of two phases, in which sector level research and company level circularity calculations were conducted in order to present a few examples, focusing on associated materials flow and physical waste-streams, excluding water and energy cycles.\n4 AFD, French Development Agency\n5 Business World and Sustainable Development Association, /s Diinyasi Surdtirtlebilir Kalkinma Dernegi\nve\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 8",
  "page_9": "Many KPIs have been developed over time to assess governance, social and environmental performances — but all-in-one circularity indicators are a relatively novel concept. To quantify companies and industries’ circularity performance that will assist them with adopting a cradle-to-cradle approach, we have adopted the circularity calculation methodology developed by KPMG Netherlands which was inspired by WBCSD's CT] Framework’. With this approach, companies can track how circular their operations and products are and evaluate the impact of their sustainability strategies over the years. As it will be later demonstrated on this report, we have conducted this study both on a sector and company level, utilizing the limited information that was available. The consensus of our investigation was that circularity concepts are unbeknownst to majority and sustainability practices are mainly limited to recycling, which are also some of the reasons of nation and company wide data limitations. We need to widen the scope of circularity practices to encompass the entire value chain and product life cycle to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. We hope that this preliminary study will not only introduce companies, leaders, investors and consumers to circular economy principles and the potential of circularity strategies in Turkey, but will also enhance organizations’ awareness regarding circularity practices and highlight the importance of data for tracking to supplant cradle-to-grave with cradle-to-cradle. ® World Business Council for Sustainable Development\nPreliminar\n—\nb\nectors In Turkey 9\n\\\n4",

The results presented below are not representative of the entire sector. As a result of the limited number of sources that were available for consultation for the sectoral study, quantitative projections cannot be made with the information provided below. Due to lack of data, study was applied to a portion of the sector and results are based on estimation from volunteer companies and publicly available sources.\nPhase 1:\nFollowing the selection of the sectors, work moved onto extensive research that included the following main activities:\ne Identified, collected and analysed the publicly available data needed to measure circularity performance on a national level via the circularity calculation methodology. Sources consulted included Turkish companies, sector associations, academia, Ministries and online research of reports. Due to lack of public data, extensive stakeholder consultation was conducted through meetings, interviews and surveys with leading companies, start-ups, experts, industry associations and the Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change to obtain more circularity data and verify and cross-validate information. Further macro level analysis is needed to enrich the methodology, underlying data and improve the circular economy performance levels of sectors in Turkey. Data covered a yearlong span. A total of 29 organizations and researchers from 5 sectors contributed to the research and data validation during phase 1. While the circularity calculation methodology was used to calculate the circularity of all five sectors, the results of only two (Plastic Packaging and Textiles) have been disclosed in this report due to the low quality of data. Details of phase 1 study are summarized in the sections of each sector. During Phase 1, circularity calculation methodology results were deemed low-quality for some sectors due to lack of data.\n7 Business Council for Sustainable Development Turkey, /s Diinyasi Stirdtirtilebilir Kalkinma Dernedgi,\nve\n8 Agence Francaise de Développement\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 42",
  "page_13": "Phase 2:\ne In order to enrich the data collected in Phase 1 study, which will be detailed further in later sections, the scope of the study Phase 2 study was conducted to calculate circularity rates at company level. To complement the results of Phase 1, circularity calculation methodology study was interpreted to include the calculation of individual companies’ circularity rates. Meetings were held with 15 companies from five sectors and four companies from plastics packaging, textile and construction sectors volunteered to participate in this project. Each participating company had the option to choose which product, project or plant circularity they wanted to evaluate and circularity calculation methodology was used to calculate circularity rates. For plastic packaging and textile sectors, data covered yearlong production of selected product lines. For construction sector, data was collected for a single project and the time frame was the start and end date of that project, which was longer than a year. The reason for scope variance is due to the nature of operations and products; while the plastic packaging and textile manufacturing sectors usually have a continuous product stream, construction companies work on a project-basis. Additionally, it was decided that a product or project focused approach instead of a company-wide one would be more useful for the participating companies to better understand their own performance. Circularity of inputs and outputs vary vastly from output to output, even within the same company. e Details of phase 2 study are summarized in the sections of each sector.\nThe methodology followed on this project has inspired by the methodology developed by WBCSD's Circular Transition Indicator (CTI) Framework. Hereinafter, the method used in this report will be referred to as ‘circularity calculation methodology’.\nCircularity calculation methodology uses the following definitions to evaluate circularity in which weight and % composition are primarily evaluated:\n% circular input\nThis ratio assesses the circularity rate of input materials. Inout materials are the sum of non-renewable, renewable and secondary materials used in production, as classified based on the following definitions:\nNon-renewable materials (tonnes): This is the weight of input that has neither been previously used or consumed (virgin) nor is it renewable. Therefore, for these materials, circularity is 0%.\nRenewable materials (tonnes): Renewable input is the weight of sustainably managed resource that is replenished/regrown after extraction. Input can consist of either fully or partially of renewable content. Thus, in this case, % circularity input is the % renewable material content.\nSecondary materials (tonnes): Secondary material is the weight of previously recovered non-virgin or secondary (reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled) materials. Input can consist of either fully or partially of renewable content. Hence, in this case, % circularity input is the % recovered content.\nIn the event input is both renewable and secondary, it is counted only once in the input in order to prevent double counting.\n% circular output\nThis ratio assesses the circularity rate of output materials. Output materials are the sum of products, by-products and waste generated during and after production and are as classified based on following definitions:\nProduct (tonnes): These are the weight of the target output of the manufacturing activities. By-product (tonnes): |n some sectors and companies, weight of by-products were included in calculations if data was available. Waste (tonnes): These are the weight of outputs of the manufacturing activities that, based on a linear model, no longer have economic utility.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 13",
  "page_14": "% Potential ratio of recovery: This is the potential recoverability rate of outputs based on how they were designed and treated in a way that they can be recovered ona technical, material level at end of life. Recovery design solutions can include disassembly, repairability and recyclability. Recovery potential refers to material recovery but does not include energy recovery.\n% Actual recovery: This is the realized recovery rate of outputs that leave the organization and actually find their way back into the value chain (either the same or a different value chain) and covers products, by-products, and waste). Recovery is different from collection. After collection, materials can still end up in landfill or incinerated. For this reason, this indicator is not based on estimates but requires actual data and in case no data is available the actual recovery is deemed to be 0%.\nThe aggregated weight of products, by-products and wastes yielded the weight of the total output.\nThe analysis for this report focused on the production and manufacturing phases; energy and water cycles alongside extraction of materials, transportation and end-of-life phases of products were excluded from the scope of the circularity calculation methodology. Only associated materials flow and physical waste-streams were considered for the selected sectors, products and project. Waste streams covered in the calculations include packaging wastes, hazardous wastes, paint-dye sludge, wastewater treatment sludge, by-products and scraps. Domestic wastes are excluded in this study. Additionally, construction, excavation and demolition wastes are excluded in the calculations except for the construction sector phase 2 study calculations. Here, it is important to note that in order to have an in depth understanding of circularity performance, the entire life cycle should be considered — which means performing the circularity study on the entire value chain.\nIt was decided that a product or project focused approach instead of a company-wide one would be more useful for the participating companies to better understand their own performance. Circularity of inputs and outputs vary greatly from output to output, even within the same company; regulations, clients, environment, infrastructure, availability of resources and a product's function are just some of the variables that affect the circularity potential. Due to this, companies that produce a range of products may prefer to track their circularity performance over the years for the same or similar product lines and instead of assessing all activities at once. Finally, a product-based approach also allows companies to better evaluate their costs per unit.\nThis report is a first attempt to assess the current state of circularity in some of the largest sectors in Turkey. It aims to raise awareness of circular economy principles and accelerate the transition away from a linear economy.\nThe report covers circular best practices mostly from France and Turkey to highlight opportunities for scaling up circular solutions more broadly across the sectors studied. In addition, it has also determined current gaps in data, technical and regulatory obstacles and untapped potential and opportunities. Work was undertaken over December ‘19 - December ‘21; the dates of the company's circularity calculation methodology data covered 01.01 2021 — 31.12.2021 for plastics packaging and textiles sectors while it covered the entire duration of the project for the construction sector.

  "page_17": "_|ntrocuction\nCircular economy is a cradle-to-cradle approach that focuses on regenerative design. It aims to optimize the value of materials, both environmentally and economically, by circulating resources, products, parts and materials continuously. Innovative business models that prioritize quality, durability, versatility, re-use, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling, renewability, and biodegradation are the pillars of a circular economy. Through circular designs and sustainable consumption, waste generation will fall concomitantly with lower demand on raw materials. For these principles to become the norm, a full-scale intervention in the value chain by the participation and contribution of all consumers and institutions is necessary.\nWhile traditional linear models have been proven to be profitable up until recently, such business activities and profits cannot be sustained in a world where planetary boundaries are being challenged. As environmental risks’ grip on world economy and policies tightens, companies that do not rejoinder will eventually face regulatory, operational, business, market and stakeholder risks. A circular business case can act as a defence mechanism against these risks while increasing resource efficiency and reducing long-term costs.\nPrinciples of circular economy rely on re-thinking and re-designing every aspect of how we produce, consume and discard as we move away from a linear economy that is defined by the take-make-waste model.? Ellen MacArthur Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the study and application of circular economy model, has outlined three circular economy pillars:\n1 Eliminate Waste and Pollution 2. Circulate Products and Materials 3. Regenerate Nature‘\nCircular economy pillars define waste and pollution as design flaws instead of unavoidable by-products, which means that they can be removed from the equation by changing product, service and process designs. To ensure that fewer resources are used, products will need to be designed for durability. For consumption to be circular, waste needs to circulate back into the economy and landfills utilized only as a last resort. Finally, while using fewer resources will put less stress on the environment, natural systems wvill still have to be further supported through restoring, nourishing and growing processes.\nDecoupling value creation, production and consumption from systematic reliance on raw materials and waste pilling-up is at the heart of the concept of a circular economy. In this respect, a circular economy is not simply focused on minimising the use of materials and wastes but looks more broadly at the overall amount of water consumed, wastewater recycled/reused and emissions reduced alongside materials and wastes’ levels of purity and toxicity; thus, it also insists on reducing consumption of energy, water and pollutants while shifting towards renewable energy. The economic and environmental rationale behind the circular economy is clear-cut as several value creation levers drive its mechanics: the amount of materials used is minimised compared to a linear production system; material reuse is maximised both through time and through the number of reuses; reuses can be diversified across the whole value chain; and finally, materials’ purity reinforces efficiencies in collection and redistribution.\nAdopting a circular approach for resource consumption imitates the processes of natural systems. In the natural environment, everything returns to nature and is absorbed by the environment. A circular approach to materials management follows the same philosophy, working to reduce and avoid waste throughout the lifecycle.®\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 47",

  "page_21": "Circularity principles aim to phase out waste or minimise at the very least, as demonstrated by the 9R framework adapted from Potting et al. It is important to note that the strategies have been listed sequentially. Circular practices need to start with refusing first, which does not require any energy or resource, and then continue with other items where recovery is dictated as a last resort. To support this principle, countries like Norway and Denmark have an incineration tax.? Similar prioritization is also emphasized in the butterfly diagram from Ellen MacArthur foundation, shown earlier in this section, where recycling is the final loop in the technical cycle. Additionally, only when all strategies have been exhausted, should recovery and other waste management systems be utilized.\nThis enumeration from the 9R Framework stresses that recycling and recovery, which are more pervasive in our existing sustainability practices despite being more energy intensive processes compared to other strategies, are to be treated as final resorts to circulate materials and resources.\nThese strategies are applicable for all players of the economy; responsibility falls on consumers, producers, financial institutions and legal entities alike for its implementation. For instance, consumers can ‘refuse’ to lower their demand for certain goods and services, while producers can ‘refuse’ to switch to more sustainable resources and regulators can ‘refuse’ by limiting or banning certain practices. Similarly, regulators will have to implement the technology and systems to collect and ‘recycle’ while producers and consumers will have to participate by methodically discarding materials and equipment that are no longer usable.\nThis transition comes with a very high price tag, though, it is less than the cost of an environmental failure, and the overarching responsibility of financing these ambitions falls on financial institutions. However, finance sector revolves around data and data pertaining to ESG performance is a relatively young study. Organizations have become adept in monitoring and reporting their financial assets; yet, reporting of non-financials remains insufficient and sporadic. Impact of environmental risks are growing and are now becoming more intertwined with economic and political risks; thus, organizations need to assess their investments, operations and value chains by quantifying and integrating such factors to reduce the risk of a default.\nOne way to do so will be applying circularity principles into data aggregation. The methodology in this report, which will be elucidated in the later sections further, attempts to assess a business's dependence and impact on non-circular and circular resources alongside the utility and recoverability of its outputs.\nAnother key aspect of circularity is communication.'® For this system to work with all its intended participants, awareness needs to be established and information shared accordingly. Knowledge of circularity needs to be communicated with a clear and concise language to reach an audience from all backgrounds, which is also one of the goals of this report. Communication also means inclusion and connection; industrial symbiosis projects and collaborations increase participation and optimize the flow of materials. Joint ventures enable different minds and resources to come together to unlock new knowledge, grow networks, share information and accelerate innovation.\nThis aspect of circularity also highlights the controversy of intellectual property and patents. While organizations such as WIPO® incentivize innovation and secure profits through licensing, such competitiveness can also hinder sustainable development.'® In a capitalist economy, innovations are used to create a competitive advantage in the industry instead of advancing circularity in the whole industry.\nWhen Volvo opened up the patent for its 3-point seat belts designed by Nils Bohlin, it did so because it valued safety over profits.\" This allowed other automakers to immediately replicate and implement that design, which has saved countless lives and averted serious damage for its users. Similarly, when Simon Velez and Marcelo Villegas designed durable bamboo houses as a means of affordable housing, they made their designs publicly available and never patented them. They also invested their time to educate the illiterate workers on the techniques they developed to spread their knowledge. Now, their sustainable houses can be found in thousands worldwide, which shows the power of communication in increasing impact.'*\nA study by WEF found that patent protection loss increases subsequent innovations by 50%, although this value varied across environments. Patent loss fuelled further innovations especially in the electronics industry while cumulative innovation was not seen in pharmaceuticals at the same rate.\"* This reaffirms that licenses, while promoting creative solutions, can slow down the global progress towards a circular economy in specific sectors.\n® WIPO —World Intellectual Property Organization\n1 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 24",
  "page_22": "2.1 Global Circularity Outlook\nAs households and communities’ living conditions improve, their demand for resources and products grow, too — in a linear economic model, that is. Thus, to ensure the long-terms success of SDGs set by the United Nations, changing designs, behaviour and consumption is of paramount importance.\nAccording to the CGRi', the global economy is now consuming more than 100 billion tonnes of materials annually for the first time; yet, the current level of circularity is very limited and has even started to falter.'* The latest annual Circularity Gap Report, launched in 2022, estimated that the world is only 8.6% circular, representing a reduction from 9.1% in the past 2 years.'® Globally, approximately 37% of waste is disposed in a landfill, 33% is discharged into open areas, 19% is recycled, and 11% is treated with modern incineration.'® This break down of waste treatment alone shows the lack of circularity practices across industries, since the only circularity strategy that is tracked is recycling.\nMany of the top risks facing the economy are now sustainability-related systemic risks such as climate action failure, extreme weather conditions and biodiversity loss. For instance, for the last 2 years, the World Economic Forum has rated majority of the top risks as environment related.” On the other hand, circularity solutions offer great potential for accelerating decarbonization, decreasing pollution, limiting biodiversity loss and mitigating water related risks by reducing our demand on virgin raw materials.\nIn light of growing resource scarcity issues and the accelerating global climate crisis, circular solutions offer many other potential benefits. Collateral benefits can include greater efficiency and profitability, reduced waste and cost, better innovation and enhanced customer relationships. Research has demonstrated that the circular economy presents huge opportunities for businesses, with one recent study suggesting that in Europe, adopting circular principles could generate net economic benefit of EU€1.8 trillion (USD 2 trillion) and 700,000 new jobs by 2030.''9\nCircular approach is not simply limited to environmental considerations but also encompasses social aspects such as economic prosperity, job creation and social equity. Sustainable development thus constitutes a key driver of a circular economy and both reinforce each other as circularity works towards “a more resource- aligned” and “people-centric future”.\n2.2 Circularity in the EU\nThe Circular Economy is a key pillar in the EU Green Deal, its new growth strategy to transform the union into a modern, resource-efficient, competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, where economic growth is decoupled from resource use and where no person and no place is left behind. A key building block of the European Green Deal is the CEAP\"?’, which was published in 2015, adopted by the European Commission in 2020. Moving to a Circular Economy is crucial to achieving the Green Deal as it will reduce pressure on natural resources, halt biodiversity loss and help EU achieve climate neutrality by 2050.\nMeasures that will be introduced under the new action plan aim to;\ne make sustainable products the norm in the EU e empower consumers and public buyers e focus on the sectors that use most resources and where the potential for circularity is high such as: electronics and ICT, batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients e ensure less waste e make circularity work for people, regions and cities\ne and lead global efforts on circular economy”*\"\n\" Circularity Gap Reporting Initiative\n' Circular Economy Action Plan\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 22",
  "page_23": "In March 2020, The EU Expert Group on Circular Economy Financing identified four high level types of circular business models: (1) “value recovery” business models where value is recaptured in the products’ end of life, (2) “circular design” business models where products’ design intentionally aims for material retention and product durability, (3) “optimal use” business models where repair and remanufacturing services increase products’ usage, and (4) “circular support” business models where advisory services and enabling activities support other circular business models.\nThe EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities, which was based on these business models, has identified activities deemed sustainable through specific performance criteria. It has a specific objective dedicated to the transition to a circular economy, with specific quantitative milestones to be reached such as a reduction of the EU27 material footprint of 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2050 (2015 baseline) and an increase in the average circular material use rate for all materials of 25% at least by 2030.7? This taxonomy will also limit “green-washing”\"*) by elucidating what actions and activities can be classified as sustainable.\nThese new ways of doing business highlight the importance of behavioural change in shifting towards a circular economy as this change will unlock a decrease in demand for new goods and the expansion of sharing and service economies. With such focus on usage rather than ownership, usage is prolonged through reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture and repurpose, to give a second life to materials, parts and products, reused to develop new ones or remanufactured to be put back in the economy.\nEurope's circularity and sustainability journey has played a key role in guiding the ecosystem in Turkey, too. Since Turkey is a major exporter of goods and services to Europe, it needs to adjust its regulations parallel to standards set in Europe to remain competitive in the market there. From EU ELV Directive” and energy labels to EU REACH\"® and EU RoHS\"® Directives, many of these practices have been adopted by the Turkish government or companies that trade with that region.\n'3 Giving false impression misleading the public about how environmentally friendly product, service is or a or company ™ European Union End-of-Life Vehicles Directive 2000/53/EC\n'S European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Directive (1907/2006)\n16 Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2011/65/EU\nat\na\nyy, ~\na\nPreliminary esearch On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 23",

In order to contain the negative social aftermath of the global lock-down, the government issued bill n°31102 in 2020, preventing the enforcement of bankruptcy proceedings and enforcements, freezing work contract termination procedures, extending the duration of mandatory unpaid leaves, etc. Additionally, economic recovery was promoted through a USD 15 billion stimulus package.?3\nUnsustainable urbanization, increasing inflation and limiting waste and pollution without compromising quality standards have become important development challenges for Turkey.

The plan noted that the presence of traditional products and production methods in manufacturing industries remain resilient but requirements for competitiveness are changing due to new trade and industrial standards introduced by the European Green Deal.\n“An Overall Assessment of the Potential of Turkey in the Context of Transition to Circular Economy Project” under the Environmental Management for Sustainable Development was kicked off in February ‘22, which is the third action of the IPA II period Environment and Climate Action Sector Operational Program. This was co-funded by the European Union and the Republic of Turkey with the end beneficiary set as the General Directorate of Environmental Management of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change. The budget allocated to the project, which will last for 36 months, is approximately 3,2 million Euros; 85% of this is EU contribution and 15% is national contribution. The project aims to enhance the institutional and technical capacity of Turkey in accordance with the EU Circular Economy Package, especially regarding waste management and transition to circular economy.?’\nThere are several other initiatives in Turkey, both registered and unregistered, that have been inadvertently contributing to the circular economy model. Prior to 2017, perhaps the most important contributors to recycling were the unregistered labour (street waste collectors) who collected and sorted domestic wastes to earn money. They accounted for most of the 9.2% of the waste recycling schemes in Turkey.28 Then, in 2018, the Turkish government announced its ‘Zero Waste’ policy to improve waste management and increase public awareness about waste treatment. Within the scope of the Zero Waste Policy, all municipalities and public private organizations are required to achieve a certain rate of waste recycling per area. The Policy's aim is to increase the recycling rate of domestic solid waste up to 35% by 2023, while 2019 domestic waste recycling rate has increased to 11,5% in Turkey.?9 Following this initiative, some improvements have been made regarding waste separation and treatment. For example, the iIBB'®) has started a project on reverse vending machines through which citizens can hand in plastic bottles and cans in exchange for public transport credits. Currently, only 9 such vending machines have been installed in metro stations and schools. This public awareness campaign about waste management also emphasizes the value of residual materials.24 Additionally, the Turkish Government introduced a fee on plastic bags to reduce their consumption. This initiative accentuated the awareness campaign regarding plastic waste while reducing plastic bag consumption by 75%.°°\n” Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n*®COP 21\n'8 Yesil Mutabakat Eylem Plani 2021\n20 17.

  "page_29": "As seen in the above examples, circularity practices in Turkey in most of the sectors concern the recycling/recovery phase; however, the ORs hierarchy categorizes these methods as last resorts since they are more capital and energy intensive processes and result in a greater loss of intrinsic value. Currently, the focus is more on the end of the lifecycle when in fact, it should be addressing the bigger picture to increase circularity.\nFor instance, enforcing stricter regulations without comprehensive financial incentives and instruments could hinder economic growth and drive-up prices by pushing companies to invest in CAPEX. The government would need to invest in infrastructure, facilities and systems that complement the new regulations as well Timing of such expenses would be important, especially during a period when the exchange rates are not in Turkish Lira’s favour and interest rates are low.\nMany Turkish companies have developed innovative circularity solutions that make them competitive on a global scale. This is due to a vast portion of their operations and clients being linked to the European market. As the global market enforces more stringent regulations, more companies in Turkey will have to invest in circularity strategies. Thus, one of the ambitions of this report is to highlight practices of circularity, other than recycling and energy recovery, to maximize the value of materials in the economy primarily through eliminating waste and pollution, optimizing the utility of materials and products and regenerating natural systems. By highlighting the vitality and benefits of circular economy practices and featuring some leading examples from Turkish producers, this report intends to encourage companies, consumers and regulators to focus more on implementing circular economy principles.\nTurkey Circular Economy Platform\nIn order to promote the active engagement of industrial companies located in Turkey with waste minimization practices and more broadly with the Circular Economy, the BCSD Turkey (SKD Turkiye) and EBRD®° have been collaboratively running a Circular Economy (CE) platform (previously referred to as Turkey Materials Marketplace, TMM) in Turkey since February 2016. Through the CE platform, companies are part of the largest business network in Turkey that is focusing on the Circular Economy. As of January 2022, the platform has more than 204 member companies.\nThe Platform includes a knowledge hub, an e-commerce platform and measurement tools, in addition to offering training, technical assistance and consultancy services for companies that are looking to accelerate their circular transition.\nCircular Vouchers\nSince 2018, Turkey Circular Economy Platform has been offering a technical assistance program called \"The Circular Vouchers\" to provide consultancy services for\nplatform members’ circular economy projects and connect them with international technical expertise. Through the Circular Vouchers, which also include short\nterm consultancies called desk-based studies, members can identify and implement circular economy practices in their businesses. This supporting package has\nbeen developed by EBRD to support companies in identifying viable circular investments (e.g. technological options available to introduce alternative raw materials\nin the production process and/or transforming by-products), adopt circular business models and introduce circular elements in their governance model.%6\nAs of 2021, 38 companies benefited from this grant, with a total budget of EUR 800,000, in order to become more circular.\n°° European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 29",

These inputs can be divided into 3 categories: non-renewable virgin content (fossil-based - oil or gas), renewable content (organic, bio-based) and recycled content (non-virgin content).*2 Most input materials for plastic packaging production are made from the first category, non-renewable virgin, which can take up to 500 years to decompose in nature.** As for biobased plastics, regardless of the nature of their raw materials, not all are biodegradable; biodegradability is an add-on property for some plastic types.*° At the end of their life, plastic materials are important resources that can be used in a new form. Their usage as secondary raw materials avoids or reduces demand on virgin raw materials, which helps avoid associated energy consumption, arable land usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\nPE plastic packaging is the most common source of plastic consumption and many of them are single use items. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the consumption of single-use plastic products such as hygiene items, takeaway packages and utensils has increased dramatically.\nThere are 2 types of plastics; thermoplastics and thermosets. The main difference between thermoplastic and thermoset plastic is that thermoplastic materials have low melting points, which means they can be reconstructed or recycled by heat exposure. The former is used more frequently in the packaging industry. The most common thermoplastics and thermoset plastics are shown in the following table.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 31",

The relative production of different types of plastic materials was as follows:\n\nFigure 3: Plastic packaging materials in Turkey in 2020%”\na\n\\\nenna\n——\nInternationally, and in Turkey, a lot of plastic waste recycling is done by small local businesses. Between 1950 and 2015, around 6,300 million tonnes of plastic waste were generated; only 9% was recycled, 12% was incinerated, and the remaining 80% was dumped into landfills or the natural environment.*® omamennahesothetbane, there is a growing de mand fopiecualeime's rial; thus, boosting the recycling ratio and certifying it for quality standards will be e ssential for increasing circularity in the industry.

  "page_34": "Even though recycling is viewed as a less prioritized circular economy strategy, for the plastic packaging sector, it is a strategy harder to avoid due to their utility in the food sector. Thus, keeping plastics away from waste-streams and directing them to recycling stations is key in circularizing these materials. Participation from both individual and industrial consumers is required; however, lack of awareness, weak policies and a narrow network for waste collection keep participation levels low. There is also public dissent regarding the efficiency of recycling set-ups with some believing that the collected waste is sent to dumpsters; this is how consumers validate their lack of contribution to the recycling cycle. Awareness of recycling, faith in the system and frequency of collection dumpsters need to be increased to boost participation.\nPlastic recycling is also problematic on a more technical level. First off, not all plastics can be recycled. Plastic packages’ physical and chemical properties make some of these materials technically challenging to recycle. Most packages used in the FMCG industry are multi-material plastic packages where some can have around seven layers of different subcomponents and recycling is harder when materials are not in a pure form. Another major issue is contamination, such as food waste; recycling centres need to sort out relevant materials which is not only time and labour intensive but also creates a health hazard for workers who do the sorting since they may get exposed to hazardous waste. It should be duly noted that some of this contamination is a result of good-intentioned consumers; however, ‘aspirational recycling’ or ‘wish cycling’S” increases inefficiencies in recycling streams by reducing the quality of the recycled materials and increasing maintenance costs.°? In order to reduce contamination, consumers need to be educated on the recycling process and sorting criteria; to further incentivize consumers, appropriate penalties should be enforced.\nThe recycling process demands energy too, and not just when the plastic is broken down. If there is no sustainable network to transport material to and from recycling stations, then the LCA*) of the recycled materials will yield poorer results. Supply chains need to be kept short and ‘low-carbon’ to avoid high emissions from logistics while achieving economies of scale in transportation and recycling facilities. Due to the energy, effort and system required to recycle plastics, recycled materials price is not always competitive against traditional raw materials, nor is the supply reliable. Financial incentives given to researchers, the recycling industry and the companies who contribute to the recycling ecosystem would need to be increased to boost recycled materials’ supply and demand.\n31 European Union Statistics Office\n82 ‘Aspirational Recycling’ and ‘Wish cycling’ is when consumer throws item into the a an recycling bin even when they are unsure about its recovery potential 33 Life Cycle Assessment",
  "page_35": "Plastic packages are also problematic due to lack of durability. For instance, plastic containers for food are not always dishwasher friendly and they tend to lose their form under heat. Their reusability needs to be improved to keep them away from landfills and recycling centres.\nRise of bioplastics made from virgin materials has been met with scepticism. In 2020, 2.3 billion people — 30% of global population did not have year-round access to adequate food, and 811 million people were undernourished® ; using arable land to replace plastics instead of mitigating the hunger crises is a trade-off that many oppose. In addition to that, bioplastics have the potential to contaminate other plastic recycling streams; since they are not easy to distinguish, they are not easy to sort. Bioplastics can also generate more emissions if they are not discarded properly; when bioplastics are incinerated in landfills and without oxygen, they may release methane, a GHG 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide.®> To avoid such outcomes, direct responsibility once again falls on consumers who need to become more conscious while obtaining and disposing of their waste.\nWhen using recycled materials, concerns regarding hygiene are raised in the food industry. Plastic packages are widely used for containing food and they play a key role in preserving nutrients. Even though they are not environment-friendly materials, their function in the food industry is critical for reducing food waste. Since they are in direct contact with edible items, there are certain health standards that have to be met, which are included in the Turkish Food Codex Legislation. Health standards, understandably, slow down the development of sustainable substitute materials that serve the same purpose as plastic packages.\nFinally, the plastics sector has been excluded from Turkey's 11\" Development Plan, even though the plan covers almost all other industries in Turkey.°” Besides a mention of bioplastics in the report, there has not been any strategies laid out for plastic packaging or any of its subsectors.

Boosting this performance will depend on introducing new regulations that increasing the usage of circular materials during production, such as setting a minimum requirement for recycled and renewable content % or providing tax breaks for companies who reach a certain level of circularity input. Regulations will need to be supported by complementing initiatives, such as increasing the supply of certified recycled materials and manufacturing high quality circular materials. Ensuring quality through certification will also support the increasing number of companies that are committing to establish a more sustainable supply chain. In cases where health and quality standards pose as an obstacle for changing the composition of the plastic package, supporting R&D that complements this goal will be necessary.\nThe circularity of output was determined as 13%, while recovery potential®” and actual recovery were deduced to have a huge gap, 88% vs. 13%. This gap can be reduced after addressing issues in areas of collection, transportation and separation of the waste through designing new policies that increase participation (both for industries and end-users), educating consumers on the process to reduce contamination and improving the network for collecting and sorting materials.\nIn the past few years, Turkey has focused more on excelling in the global plastic waste imports market. After China removed itself from the scene in 2017, this created an opportunity for Turkey to capitalize the market. In the past 15 years, plastic waste imports increased by 173 folds, with a major spike coming after 2016. To keep the input of such waste high, barriers to enter and stay in the market were kept low, with financial incentives like tax exemptions.® As a result of this spike in capacity, certain data was never tracked or made public. Issues regarding data availability are expected to improve with new regulations, which will in turn help with keeping track of the circularity performance in the plastics sector. One way the regulators will be addressing the issue of traceability is through the MOTAT®® which will be tracking wastes via chips from port to factory.\nConsequently, the limited data availability introduces uncertainty in the calculations from the sector.

The packaging product ,by-product and dye sludge datas are given as output.\ne\nThe biggest reason for the difference between potential and actual recovery rates is the lack of circular inputs; if inputs that are recyclable or recoverable are used, actual recovery would be higher for Company X and Y. The recovery potential in this example is very high which means that the products are recoverable. The main reason of this difference between the recovery potential and actual recovery is the insufficient end of life products collection and recovery practices.

The monetary value of the 2.1 billion pieces of bread that are wasted in Turkey in a year is estimated as 1.5 billion TL. Turkey's annual economic loss due to bread waste is equivalent to the income the country receives from flour exports, where Turkey ranks first in the world.\nPlasticMove, one of the finalists in TUSIAD’s “Bu Genclikte [s Var 2020” start-up competition, offers a solution to this problem based on the circular economy model and regains this waste stream into the economy for further use in the plastic industry. The istanbul based start-up was inspired by technologies that use corn starch to produce bioplastics, but that method relies on resources that could be used to combat hunger while 690 million people go hungry every day. Instead, PlasticMove's approach covers various SDGs and focuses on recycling starch-based agricultural and food waste to produce biopolymers without directly relying on the farming industry.'29 '24\nThe biopolymer was developed by working with companies in FMCG and automotive industries, which are characterized by high levels of plastic consumption; their packaging partners enable these companies to reduce their use of plastic by up to 20%. By reducing their plastic usage, these firms aim to reduce their carbon emissions and reach their environmental targets faster.\nFor every kilogram of bread, PlasticMove can make 1.3 kg of bioplastic and for every kilogram of bioplastic they produce, they prevent at least 6 kg of CO, emissions.\nAs anew company in the industry, they are currently more focused on integrating their materials as a fraction of their partners’ products. PlasticMove'’s plastic substitute is compatible with 2 types of common plastics: polypropylene and polyethylene. While testing this material at KordSA‘s facilities, they found that the products were compatible with these plastic types and yielded the same quality when 10% of it was substituted with biopolymer. The start-up just landed its first partnership with Evyap and Sarten where their materials will be used as a part of plastic bottle caps. This project will not only redirect waste streams but also reduce the demand for fossil resources which are the basis of traditional plastic products. In 2021, PlasticMove plans to finish product validations with 8 customers that operate in FMCG and the automotive industry and receive purchase contracts from these customers to further initiate the mass production stage in 2022.16\n51\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 47\n49 Turkish Grain Board T.

The industry accounts for 10.1% of national exports, for a total amount of USD 14.8 billion.\nTextile is more than the clothes we wear. It is an all-encompassing industry, which makes changing demand and supply patterns in favour of sustainability across the entire industry a challenge. Some examples of textile components outside of the fashion industry include home textiles, seat belts, industrial filters, face masks and even road materials. Each has a unique purpose and composition; so, setting standards and regulations and establishing sweeping circular economy targets is complex.\nThe utilization rate of clothing items decreases as household income increases.'°°\nOver the years, the textile industry has seen a rise in inefficient consumption, especially in the clothing sector. While the household's demand for garments increases, the utilization rate of such products has decreased. Compared to 15 years ago, the number of times textiles are worn before being discarded has decreased by 36%. This pattern in consumption highlights the importance of consumers ‘refusing’ in order to lower their demand and ‘reusing’ to increase the circularity of goods.\nMcKinsey Fashion Scenarios suggest that global fashion sales will reach 96-101% of 2019 levels in 2021 and 103-108% in 2022. Still, while sales are expected to make a recovery in the following year, performance will vary across geographies; growth will most likely be driven by the US and China, while the European market diminishes consumption.'*° In response, many companies will recalibrate their retail footprints, even amid uncertainty as to whether these pandemic-induced behavior shifts will stick.\nThe industry includes resource-intensive processes. It ranks 2\"* among production industries for water consumption during production, and 5\" amongst agricultural activities of cotton and the crops that consume the most water. In 2015, the global market consumed around 98 million tonnes of resources including oil to make synthetic fibres, fertilizers and pesticides to grow crops and chemicals to dye and finish fibres. 97% of its inputs were virgin feedstocks, plastic and cotton.'?\" However, there is potential to make textiles, and subsequently the food industry, more sustainable; by making the transition to the use of recycled cotton, recent studies have indicated that 17% of agricultural land in Turkey, equivalent to an area of 766,390 hectares, can be freed up.'*? Using this land to grow crops for food would drive down domestic food prices and increase the gains from exported agricultural products.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 49",
  "page_50": "lf the industry continues to embrace current decarbonisation initiatives at the ongoing pace, emissions will be capped at around 2.1 billion tonnes a year by 2030, which is around the same as they are now. This would leave levels at nearly double the maximum required to stay on the 1.5-degree pathway. To align with the 1.5-degree pathway over the next 10 years, the fashion industry needs to intensify its efforts. In practice, that means embracing accelerated abatement, which is estimated to reduce annual emissions to around 1.1 billion tonnes, about half of today’s figure.'%%\nAccording to the data of the European Union Commission, the textile sector is the 3rd largest sector contributing to GHG emissions globally. Considering only the energy consumption during the production process, approximately 10% of global GHG emissions arise from this sector alone, which exceeds the combined contribution (pre-COVID-19) of international aviation and shipping. Hence, by transitioning to renewable energy, the textile sector can have a significant impact in terms of decarbonizing the global economy.'*\n“Textile production, one of the industries with the highest pollution rate, produces 1.2 billion tons of CO, per year. More than 60% of textiles are used in the apparel industry, and it is stated that about 5% of global emissions come from the fashion industry. Synthetic fibres have had higher production rates in recent years. Polyester is the most used fibre and has replaced cotton at the beginning of the 21st century. Emissions for polyester and other synthetic materials are very high because they are produced from fossil fuels. In 2015, polyester production resulted in 706 billion kg of CO,,. (Rita Kant,2021)\"\nTextiles’ production uses around 93 billion m3 of water annually and globally while discharging high volumes of water containing hazardous chemicals into the environment.'*° In Turkey, studies show that textile production processes account for 15% of the industrial water consumption.'*° In a region that is already inflicted by seasonal draughts and is marked by the growing numbers of dried up lakes, water usage is currently a matter of life and death for some species. With the aggravating effects of climate change, water crises is expected to have a more crippling impact on communities, industries, nature and biodiversity.\nDuring the production phase, a major concern in textiles is the chemical waste that mixes in with the water. It is estimated that 20% of industrial water pollution load is a result of the treatment production of fabrics and fibres. Textiles generate pollution during their usage too. Microplastic pollution caused by the washing of synthetic textiles has recently been assessed as the main source of primary microplastics in the oceans.

About 12% is cascaded recycling®®), in which significant economic value is lost.'° Thus, a linear consumption does not only waste materials and resources but also economic value too. Increasing circularity in this subsector would have economic gains for consumers and producers alike.\nToday's textile sector is mainly linear with the sector using large amounts of resources and being responsible for a range of negative externalities. However, there are also many examples of companies internationally and in Turkey starting to embrace more circular business models.\nMain Obstacles and Corresponding Strategies\nIn a world defined by capitalist motives, it is hard to convince the consumer that more is usually not better. From social media to offices, many environments dictate a certain sense of fashion as appropriate, which challenges the first chain of 9Rs: refuse. Consumers are marketed the idea of ‘appropriateness’ by not just brands and marketing agencies but also by society. Environments such as restaurants, offices, gyms and schools inadvertently increase demand by enforcing expectations and rules to create a certain ambiance, which pushes consumers to make additional purchases for every occasion. Circularity principles need to apply to societal expectations in order to refuse and reduce the demand for unnecessary goods.\nThe growth of fast fashion has exasperated the problem that arises from a linear economy. Buying more for less has no just fuelled overconsumption but also increased waste since consumers are more likely to throw away items that hold less economic value. Thus, price of goods and its relativity to disposable income play key roles in controlling demand, waste and ‘refuse’ culture.\nMoving away from clothing, demand for textiles increase via demand for other marketed goods, such as automotive, furniture and buildings. By designing and producing quality goods that are durable, multi-functioning, easy to dismantle and are reusable, goods and materials can circulate in the economy for longer. Textiles complement products in other sectors, which also means that they are discarded as waste when the items they are used in are no longer deemed as useful. Designing textiles that can be dismantled or separated without damaging other components, such as those used in car interiors, would increase the reclaimed materials remanufacturing potential.\nA lot of fibre is generated as waste (or by-products if circular principles are applied) in factories; about 12% of the inputs are lost during production. Collecting these fibres for closed-loop recycling can prove very useful for reclaiming value that would have been lost otherwise. The problem regarding quality rises in this sort of application: since these by-products are relatively shorter fibres, it is more challenging to make longer-lasting fabrics. Companies are challenged with the loss of reusability when using production waste; thus, they can only mix in a certain ratio of reclaimed threads into their fabrics.\nKeeping valuable goods out of landfills requires consumer participation and brands have been implementing systems to incentivize post-consumer textile waste collection. While all circular practices are encouraged, some recycling incentives also generate more demand. For instance, brands sell new items at discounted prices if old clothes are dropped off for recycling at the store. While there are benefits to such actions, it should be noted that this strategy can still induce overconsumption.\nNot all textiles are recyclable. Especially in the garment industry, certain dyes, pigments, patterns and prints reduce the recovery potential of the fabric. Additionally, textiles are harder to recycle when the variance in its composition increase. For instance, a 100% cotton shirt can still include sewing threads or labels made from other materials such as polyester. Accessories like zippers, buttons, beads make the separation process very labour intensive and it requires a skilled workforce. Separating materials is a tedious process, but there is potential of growing employment in this sector. Low-income communities can be targeted which would generate more income and employment opportunities for less educated people.\n52 Closed Loop Recycling: materials recycled into similar applications are same or\n58 Cascaded recycling is downcycling.

  "page_53": "> Be <~ ys es\nLe §\n2\n=\nLS. 3S\niS\nPhi\nA\nBesides these general issues regarding textile circularity, the industry in Turkey faces several other challenges that come in the form of regulations and taxation. Producers are taxed for almost all items that are taken out of stock under the VAT” Regulations®®*’; this means that even if a company wants to give away its deformed or unsold goods for charity or research, the company will still need to pay VAT for these goods. However, products such as textile scraps and fabric fabrics are exceptions. Therefore, these products are included in the scrap textile waste category and are evaluated with 0% VAT.\nThe only way to avoid such payment would be to bury it or burn it. Such taxes deter companies from engaging in circularity strategies and hinders the potential of circularity innovations in the textile industry.\nSun Tekstil sends the waste generated as a result of production activities to licensed waste collection facilities for recycling. They primarily redesign the products remaining in stock. If it is still unsold, they wait for the period specified by the brands and sell it to the personnel with a symbolic fee. Products that cannot be kept in stocks are converted into scrap and sent to licensed waste facilities. These wastes are converted into products such as yarn, felt and filling materials at the facilities. The products that cannot be recycled are sent to energy recovery or landfill. Taxes on unsold goods need to be lifted in order to encourage companies to recycle, remanufacture, share and donate. Further incentives can be implemented by lowering VAT on finished goods that were manufactured with a certain rate of circular inputs.\nMost textile wastes are also among the list of banned imports. While this ruling can be perceived as an obstacle in increasing recycled content production in a country where there is no efficient collecting and sorting scheme, it is also in line with ensuring that Turkey is not pressured with other countries wastes and supply chains are kept short.

However, data is not available for these inputs and hence could not be included.\nOmission of textile wet processing\nAnalysis of Circularity Calculation Results\nThe scope of the study was the manufacturing phase, where materials are weaved and processed into textiles. The sub-sector that was focused on the circularity calculation methodology data collection was the clothing industry. Primarily, the TUIK data set was used to determine the total weight numbers, but there were many omissions in their data set, and the reason for such omissions were not indicated. To have an accurate calculation on a macro-level, data transparency is a must.\nFor the textiles sector in Turkey, the circularity of input was estimated to be around 16% and the output was 23%. However, these figures are calculated according to the assumptions made using the publicly available data, opinion of sector experts and companies which responded the survey. Due to the low number of participants representing large textile companies with good practices, these figures do not represent the average circularity rates of the textile sector and actual figures are estimated as much lower in textile sector in Turkey. The performance of both inputs and outputs can be improved by changing tax regulations regarding the flow of waste, unused materials, scraps and unsaleable goods. This would increase the flow of non-virgin materials between companies. These ratios can be increased by implementing fiscal incentives on finished goods — for instance, a lower tax on circular textile products would stimulate companies to change their designs and material compositions. If the end-of-the-life cycle is considered in the design phase, Circularity calculation methodology performance can be improved further by manufacturers avoiding, mixing materials, designing prints and embellishing fabrics.\nMany companies stated that they do not track the number of chemicals used in their processes since it varies vastly. The WWF report has also determined the mass of dyes and chemicals used in the textile industry to vary between 10% and 100% of the mass of the finished good.'® Due to this wide range, calculations based on assumptions could not be carried out either. On the one hand, it can be deduced that by excluding an integral component of the production process which had a high environmental footprint, the Circularity calculation methodology for the output was calculated to be potentially higher than the actual performance. However, it is also important to note that such exclusion was also partially supported by the framework of the Circularity calculation methodology Module 1 used for this study does not include the water flow and most of the chemicals and dyes used in textile belong in this cycle.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 57",

Gama has developed a new technic for recycling second-hand garments, in which they manufacture pure recycled cotton from multi blended fabrics. To ensure transparency, they have also established a tracing system for recycled fibers.\nThe upcycled material is then sent back to Orta Anadolu to be used in their new products. A downside of recycled fabric is that the fibre is shorter than others; so, the material is less homogenous and weaker. To compensate for its lack of durability, Orta Anadolu has been focusing on improving what they call the “Golden Ratio”, the ratio of recycled materials and natural resources to create high quality recycled jeans.\nOrta Anadolu used 650,000 kg of recycled materials in 2020 to produce new fabric which accounts for 20% of the product. Collaboration with Gama aims to bring this number up to 1 million kg in 2021 which will equate to 2,800 tons of CO, emissions prevented and 1,860,000 m? of water conserved at the farming level.\nOrta Anadolu has partnered with Levi's to improve the post-consumer recycling process as well. Globally, it is estimated that only 1% of textiles are recycled meaning that more than USD 100 billion worth of materials are lost every year.'?° By using the jeans received from Levi's, Orta Anadolu created 4 new types of recycled fabric that uses up to 20% of non-virgin material.

Most textile factories employ membrane processes such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to reuse wastewater steam; however, even though this process yields produce high quality water, it also produces brine as waste which is a highly polluted concentrate. The demo project located in Zorluteks Textile’s plant in Kirklareli will focus on developing a treatment and recovery system for this brine(concentrate stream) which can potentially recover about 400 tons of NaCl in a year.3 By , recycling wastewater, it is projected that demand for salt will decrease by 40%, water consumption by 15% and GHG emissions by 20% while improving aquatic environments and protecting the soil from salination.7°\nWith an interdisciplinary and systemic innovation approach, “OXIPRO” aims to develop environmentally friendly and sustainable products to be used in detergent, textile cosmetics and nutraceuticals (food supplements) sectors.

Considering aspects such as repairability, refurbishment, reusability of components, insurance schemes and production and service waste management standards, automotive sector plays a key role in supporting the circular economy in Turkey.2\"\nOne method to reduce energy consumption during production is to remanufacture. For example, Renault's re-manufactured gearboxes contains an average of 75% pre-used but tested parts while its engines currently contain 38% pre-used tested parts.?'* Renault's studies also show that giving components a new life requires 88% less water and more than 92% less chemicals. This circular approach can reduce overall waste by 70%.2'° As another example in Turkey, measured the rate of reuse and recycling processes approximately 91% within the scope of the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulation, and this rate does not include energy recovery and disposal processes. In addition, all wastes arising from vehicle production are evaluated as 100% recovery. Additionally, since most metals are easy to recycle, the metal waste generated during production has a high recovery potential. Even though automakers cannot utilize closed-loop recycling of certain materials due to regulations, their waste is still fit to be used in other sectors.\nBy incorporating pre-used and recyclable materials, the need for virgin raw materials and energy-intensive mining and manufacturing processes can be significantly reduced.\n64 Fiat, Renault and Ford accounted for majority of sales in Turkey. a All 3 of these brands have factories located in Turkey. °°\n2019 data\n°6 2019 data\n®7 Employment number is from 2020 February\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 67",

It was concluded that the following points would need to be addressed to lower air pollution:?\"*\ne Establishment of Low Emission Zones e Promotion of dissemination of low emission vehicles e Enforcement of stricter exhaust measurements Issuance of deterring traffic fines based on stricter standards Evaluation and repurposing of ELV scrap Increased traffic monitoring e Implementation of fiscal incentives to boost the production and sale EVs and low-emission vehicles e Offering financial incentives for dismantling and recycling factories\nAnother focus area for research and development projects has been smart technology integration; by improving data systems and software, drivers not only benefit from optimized route and lower fuel consumption but can also potentially achieve this without having to purchase a new vehicle. Smart technologies have also been improving the sharing economy, which is globally expected to reach USD 335 billion in 2025. Considering the potential in Turkey, it is expected to grow even faster, especially in the field of mobility as a service, MaaS.'©* According to Statista’s survey results from 2021, 16% of users used the services of MaaS businesses in the past 12 months in Turkey. Additionally, a study conducted in 2019 found that the rate of multimodal traveling in Turkey is relatively high compared to Europe and America with 27% of car owners in Turkey regularly benefiting from multiple models of mobility. Istanbul's status as the most populated city in Turkey and the 5\" most congested city in the world, makes the city an auspicious ecosystem for MaaS applications. It is estimated that the total revenues of the sharing economy in the automotive sector in Turkey will reach USD 53 million in 2021, and USD 107 million in 2025.\n°8 Mobility Service\nas a\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 68",

According to the regulation; the design and production of new vehicles shall thus “take into full account and facilitate” the dismantling, reuse and recovery of used vehicles as well as increasing quantity of recycled materials in vehicles and other products. In accordance with the ELV Directive and Control of End of Live Vehicles Regulation-30.12.2009, Turkish Automotive Industry has established an infrastructure to meet the below major requirements:\ne Take-Back: Economic Operators must provide a convenient network of authorised treatment facilities (ATFs), or make acceptable alternative arrangements,\noffering free take-back for their brands when they become ELVs. For this purpose, 174 licenced take-back facilities have been authorised in 81 cities in Turkey**. Materials and Components: Materials and components in M1/N1 vehicles shall not contain cadmium, lead, mercury or hexavalent chromium, unless covered by a specific exemption in Annex II of the ELV Directive. To meet these requirements, a material data system called The IMDS (International Material Data System) has been developed by the automobile industry. IMDS is now a global standard used by OEMs) to classify their parts and to ensure elimination of heavy metals and other hazardous materials. In Turkish Automobile Industry, all vehicle component producers should meet the IMDS reporting obligations. Certain plastic and rubber parts weighing over 200 grams (apart from tyres) must be marked in accordance with the regulations to promote their recovery, reuse and recycling. Recovery and recycling targets: Producers shall meet annual targets for their brands, currently 95% for recovery and 85% for recyclability rates for the plastic and metal parts used during manufacturing of vehicles. Details on recovery, reuse and recycling rates are reported to Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change by dismantling and recycling centers and facilities. In Turkey 119 authorised treatment facilities (in 43 cities) and 24 authorised final metal processing plants have been established.?'9\nAlthough a national regulation replicating the ELV Directive has come into force since 2009 in Turkey, Turkish Automobile Industry ELV infrastructure has still opportunities for improvement. Major problem is the small capacities of treatment and dismantling facilities to achieve feasible management. Annual ELV take-back number in Turkey is around 15,000 where total number of M1/N1 vehicles exceeding 21 years old is 3.5 million.\nRegarding circularity principles, some industry experts that contributed to this study also expressed that their focus has been mostly on increasing the recoverability of vehicles at the end of their life. Circularity principles that are applicable to other parts of the life cycle have not been a major focus area for some manufacturers, which is one other reason that circularity innovations are limited.\n® Original Equipment Manufacturer\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 69",
  "page_70": "Main Obstacles and Corresponding Strategies\nEven though the potential of circularity is high in the automotive industry, both the global and local sectors face numerous challenges. Since safety standards and specifications are of paramount importance, approving new materials and technologies can take longer as a result of the need for extensive research, testing and regulatory requirements. Therefore, some car producers are working on the recovery of other materials such as textiles and plastics that compose car accessories.?”°\nAs the automotive industry utilizes more data and software, and becomes increasingly digitalized, cyber risks associated with these new systems are also increasing. This is leading to concern amongst both internal and external stakeholders; customer are concerned regarding data privacy and the industry is concerned over the prospect of malicious attacks.7' It is essential to address these concerns and guarantee the safety of personal data and new products.\nMaaS applications show great potential for filling in the mobility gaps in cities like istanbul; however, certain barriers like the taxi lobby pose a threat to new comers. For instance, Uber has had a shaky start in Turkey despite a strong demand to the service; shortly after it started services in Turkey, the mobility service was banned after a harsh backlash from taxi drivers. The ban on the app was recently lifted, but it is once again being legally challenged by Istanbul Taxi Drivers Chamber of Commerce. Despite these obstacles, ride-hailing apps are still thriving and it is estimated that sharing economy in the automotive sector in Turkey will reach 1.1 million users in 2025.77° Another challenge for the car sharing economy has been the pandemic. For example, Italy recorded a 60-70% drop in car sharing services, which was fuelled both by health concerns and a decrease in user’s mobility.27* Health related concerns would have to be eliminated completely to optimize sharing economies.\nTurkish consumers also face economic barriers to switching to more sustainable solutions. Unfavourable exchange rates coupled with high inflation and taxes make many consumers more price conscious than environmentally conscious. 2020 has seen a surge in vehicle taxes; in some cases, the cost of these taxes exceeded the net sales price of the car and EVs'”” are not exempt from these fiscal instruments either.27° These prices push some drivers to purchase used cars instead of new ones, which means keeping less efficient engines on the roads; on the other hand, even though older engines are associated with higher emissions, opting for used cars also mean that the circularity of materials has increased via reuse. In 2020, of the 772,788 cars sold in Turkey, only 844 were EVs and 16,941 were hybrid vehicles, which shows how demand for these technologies is still at an early phase.**° Taxes need to be reduced on EVs, hybrid vehicles and older vehicles need to be refurbished with greener technologies for Turkey to reach Net Zero Emissions Goal for 2053.\nIn addition to the barriers noted above regarding EV purchases, there is also currently an absence of reliable infrastructure for circular and low carbon solutions. Lack of a vast charging station network deters potential buyers. Since Turkey is planning on launching its own EV in 2022, authorities are addressing these concerns by increasing network capacity and updating charging station regulations. For instance, regulations regarding minimum capacities for vehicle charging points in parking lots and shopping malls was recently updated to reflect rising demand.?*’ More details on this topic can be found in the case studies section.\nWhile EVs are hailed as a crucial step on the road to decarbonization, it is important to note that they come at a certain price. The World Economic Forum's Global Battery Alliance notes two major challenges in during extraction of minerals: \"First, raw materials needed for batteries are extracted at a high human and environmental toll. This includes, for example, child labour, health and safety hazards in informal work, poverty and pollution. Second, a recycling challenge looms over the eleven million tonnes of spent lithium-ion batteries forecast to be discarded by 2030, with few systems in place to enable reuse and recycling in a circular economy for batteries.\"\n70 Electric Vehicle\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey FQ",

While no country has laws that requires producers to report on their supply chains, two thirds of world’s cobalt need are met by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a region that is associated with many concerns regarding human rights and labour laws.?78?79\nEV batteries have low recovery potential. Chemicals and construction vary from brand to brand and variance in composition creates barriers for recycling. With such technical challenges, the price of recycled materials exceeds those of raw materials. Some nations and states are setting minimum recycled content requirements but as the demand for batteries increase, maintaining or increasing circularity input will pose a challenge.*°° Since one of the issues regarding recycling is separating components and materials, design can be improved to increase recovery potential.\n4 |\n.*\nML\nm//\n™\n\\%\n’\nr\n|\n4.\n—=—_—\" -\nOL.\nal\ny\nbee\n=e\n>\n~~,\n)\nll\n—\n=\ni}\n~~»\n*\n~\na\nf od\n7%\nPreliminary Research On Circu ay Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey J\n=—",

The factory’s focus will be on remanufacturing, recycling and researching to extend products and materials’ life cycles while reducing the consumption of virgin input.7°°\nDetails on Innovation & Circular Economy Practice\nRenault has been an active agent in developing circular practices on a global scale. The company is a founding partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and contributes to the foundation’s works and events.\nTo increase the value of its products, Renault has been focusing on ways to extend the lifetime of its equipment and preserving valuable materials for further remanufacturing. In 2019, EUR 15.6 million in electric vehicle batteries had been repaired and reused in vehicles or refurbished and resold for second-life applications. Closed-loop recycled materials such as metallic waste from plants and materials extracted from end-of-life vehicles that were reused to produce new vehicles were worth EUR 70.4 million. To optimize this extraction process, the number of fixing points has been reduced in vehicles and recyclable materials have been prioritized during manufacturing.\nRenault also established the first European factory dedicated to mobility for the circular economy, RE: Factory. By 2030, its factory in Flins, France will have a negative CO, balance. The operations will have four focus areas Retrofit, Re-energy, Re-cycle and Re- start. Retrofitting will recondition vehicles and convert thermal vehicles into less carbon intense versions, Re-energy will focus on extending battery life, Re- cycle will be using old vehicles to make new ones and Re-start will focus on other research areas.?°*\nImpact\nOne of the defining aspects of the circular economy is its reliance on partnership and communication. Renault's contribution to Ellen MacArthur Foundation, highlights the company’s commitment to circularity not just through innovation but by supporting the growth of the network too.\nThe circular economy activities of Groupe Renault and its subsidiary Renault Environment enabled the creation or preservation of EUR 219.8 million in technical and economic value during the 2019 financial year, up EUR 45.7 million compared to 2016. Renault recognizes that to generate waste with utility value at the end of a vehicle’s lifetime, products will need to be re-designed with that goal in mind. Thus, by simplifying the dismantling process, materials and equipment can be recovered more easily. By recycling and remanufacturing end-of-life waste like precious metals, polypropylene bumpers and textile scraps, le virgin material content of new products will be reduced.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 75",

Reduce the weight of the tyres, cut the emissions associated with its use and minimize the number of tires required to go anywhere. For instance, “X-ONE” tyres give the same performance as two-dual tyres even though they weigh less.\n2. Reuse to extend the life of tyres. Tyres are designed with an under tread that is thick enough to allow high quality regrooving without affecting the strength of the product. “REGROOVABLE” has been moulded on the sidewall to identify these tyres and have regrooving depth indicators act as a guide for the technician who performs the maintenance.\n3. Recover materials from tyres that have come to the end of their life cycle for other uses. “The BlackCycle Project”, a unique European public-private partnership of 13 organizations, aims at creating, developing, and optimising a full value chain from end of life tyres'”?) feedstock to Secondary Raw Materials (SRMs). These SRMs will be used to develop new ranges of passenger car and truck tyres.\n4. Renewable materials are to replace fossil-based inputs. “The BioButterfly Project” aims to produce butadiene from biomass (plants) based ethanol in order to produce innovative synthetic rubbers that are more environmentally friendly.\nImpact\n\"\n1. “X-ONE\" tyres deliver fuel savings of at least 4%. These tyres increase energy savings due to their lightness which reduces the demand for fuel.\n2. When regrooving is performed at a time when the original tread depth has 3 to 4mm remaining, regrooving will restore the tread depth, providing up to 25% greater tyre life. Regrooving also renews the grip of the tyre making the product safer. This process is carried out when the tyre has the lowest rolling resistance due to higher rigidity of the tread pattern, and low rolling resistance means increased fuel efficiency. By adding only 5% additional rubber volume when the tyre is new, these tyres will add up to 25% more kilometers which creates a 16% reduction in raw materials when compared to non-regroovable tyres. Due to having a low cost compared to performance gained, regrooving can lower operators’ running costs dramatically. In the long run, fewer new tyres will be purchased. By extending the product's life through repairing and remanufacturing, inputs required for a service are reduced over time. This product also supports the circular economy by establishing a communication line; marking these products and educating the technicians will ensure that the value of the innovation is optimized.\n3. “The BlackCycle” value chain has a lower carbon footprint, emitting 0.93 kg/CO,/kg tyre less and using 0.89 kg fossil/kg ELT less. “BlackCycle” will reduce the export of ELTs since it offers an economically and environmentally viable alternative. By relocating ELT management and transformation within the EU, “BlackCycle” is expected to create sustainable jobs inside the EU while shortening supply chains.\n4.

Many global companies like Ford, Volvo and Mini have already committed to a complete phase-out of their ICE’® vehicles while a few companies such as Tesla, the automotive company with the largest market cap globally, are already producing only EVs. The EV transition is accelerating due to drivers such as international political pressure with many major economies committing to more ambitious climate goals - including national net zero commitments - and new initiatives at the sector level which include a complete phase out of new ICE vehicle sales. For example, the UK Government recently announced it was bringing forward the ban of ICE vehicle sales from an initial phase-out date of 2040 to 2030. Phasing out of vehicles that consume carbon-based fuels requires all market players to commit to circular economy strategies, whether it be facilitating incentives, supporting infrastructure or refusing ICE technologies.\nAn intellectual property of Turkey, Togg is a globally competitive UseCaseMobility® brand. Togg was established on June 25, 2018 as a joint venture of Anadolu Grubu Holding A.S., BMC Otomotiv Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., Turkcell iletisim Hizmetleri A.S., Zorlu Holding A.S. and the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB). It is due to launch its first vehicle in 2022, followed by 4 more by 2030. Considering how the switch to EVs is yet to take hold in Turkey, Togg's price, which has not been announced yet, and its associated taxes, will be pivotal for the growth of EV markets in Turkey and in turn reducing demand for carbon-based fuels. Togg's production facility in Gemlik, Bursa, has been designed to release less hazardous waste into the environment.

In the EU, there are almost 8 billion installed products in homes which equals around 30 million tons of steel, 12 million tons of plastics as well as millions of tons of non-ferrous metals and glass.?”' It is projected that 3 billion new users will be added to the market by 2030.?’2 Increasing the circularity of these technologies will be crucial to meet this demand without consuming more non-circular materials\nTurkish companies like Arcelik A.S. and Veste! A.S. are some of the leading brands in Turkey that also dominate the global markets, both in sales and innovations. Their race for innovations has focused more on efficiency during the products usage — which is an attractive attribute for consumers since efficiencies in energy and water consumption reduce the budget allocated to these products during their use. It is also important to note that compared to other industries evaluated in this report, with the exception of vehicles, the environmental impact of home appliances during their usage is considerably high (ex: washing machines on average use 50 liters of water per use?’9), which justifies prioritizing usage efficiency during R&D. Improving efficiency in these technologies support CE as these products demand less resources (water and electricity primarily, followed by complementing products such as detergents) during their lifetime.\nIn the EU, industry-led recycling, mainly via take-back schemes set up by the industry, now collect and treat about 1.7 million tons annually across the EU but this is much less than the estimated 5 million tons of discarded appliances annually. Due to increasing resource scarcity and the need to rapidly decarbonize the global economy, the high metal content and intrinsic economic value of large appliances means that rapidly moving to a circular economy is essential for the home appliances industry. Indeed, the sector already has many initiatives in place, examples of which are shown in the following subsections.\nSince most home appliances are meant to be consumed over an extended period, EU has been implementing measures to enhance the potential of ‘repairability’, which will also benefit consumers and smaller businesses in the industry. Right to Repair movement has gained momentum all around the world and the European Commission has addressed this critical component of circular economy by implementing new eco-design measures in 2019.7” These measures require spare parts to be available for a period of time after purchase, parts to be easily dismantled and repaired with commonly available tools and disclosing professional repair and maintenance information to be disclosed for repairers. Such designs will also help refurbish products too — if products can be upgraded with just small alterations, customers would start to demand new components instead of whole new products.?”° Improving design, guaranteeing spare parts and making necessary knowledge accessible will enable consumers to use the same products for a longer time, empower the consumer and small businesses while avoiding emissions from longer supply chains.\nOther countries are implementing similar regulations too. Even though a resembling correspondence has been established in Turkey, the Directive for After-Sales Service Support®*) covers a narrower scope which dictates the number of years brands are obliged to provide repairing services after they sell a certain item.?”’ There is not a comprehensive law for eco-design established in this sector in Turkey yet — but the fact that most Turkish factories manufacture in accordance with demand and standards in the European market means that Turkish brands are equipped to support more circularity initiatives in the Turkish market.\n81 VECTO is simulation software developed by the European Commission and stakeholders that emissions and fuel a measures consumption of heavy-duty vehicles.

The major home appliances companies in Turkey also dominate the global markets — and their race for innovation, which is focused more on the efficiency of the products, is marked by their growing number of patents. While such competition drives companies to invest further in R&D, it also creates barriers in the expansion of circularity applications The importance of discrepancy also affected the quality of this report Companies could not disclose certain circularity data due to confidentially and competition\nCompanies have had a slow progress in increasing the circularity of their input, despite intensive R&D efforts. One reason is that replacing traditional plastic materials with bioplastics has been inefficient. Polyurethane (PU or PUR)”, is favored by the home appliances sector for its versatility, durability and energy efficiency. It takes longer to develop bio-based materials that showcase the same qualities under the same heat conditions for an extended amount of time. Lack of recycled materials to be utilized as inputs is another issue in the industry. Not all recycled plastics can be used in production since the exact chemical composition information is not available for all. Supply of TS EN ISO 15347 standard certified recycled plastics is low, which creates an unsteady supply of circular materials.?”°\nFor some orders, manufacturers do not have the flexibility to change the composition of the materials they use. Clients can have strict requirements that prevent the manufacturers from switching to more circular inputs; such constraints keep the manufacturers from achieving their circularity potential\nThe later steps in the ORs strategies — repairing, remanufacturing, refurbishing, repurposing and recycling - require an efficient way of collecting products at the end of their lifecycle. The operational and logistical challenges of reverse logistics prevent companies from directly engaging with consumers to reclaim used products An industry coalition, or a collection scheme supported by governments and regulations, can alleviate the problems that rise from reverse logistics. Currently, the AEEE Regulation®® has determined that companies should collect back used electronics from the end-users at the rate of 4 kg/person/year.””? The Directive should list higher quotas upon setting up a Support system for reverse logistics to boost circularity of the materials and products. Companies can use promotions and discounts to incentivize consumers to transport their end-of-life products to factories or collection points, but this carries a risk due to damages these goods can receive during transportation\nRecycling process is not directly handled by home appliances manufacturers, considering how the recycling industry has existed long before AEEE Regulations Intrinsic economic value of the materials and the high metal content in these products have attracted demand outside of the home appliances industry.”°° This ecosystem needs to be evaluated and optimized to increase the recovery potential of materials and components\n1G\na\ni—\n|\na\n{|\n=\nEEE ee —\nak =\nal\ni\nl |\n»\nals |\nie\nfw\nBn\n| [has\n=\nI\niS\n——\nfs\n))\ni\n\\\ni |\nie f\na 7\na\n|\ni)\niT\n.\n-\né )\ni\nwie\nI\nI\nVv\nW/ |\n|\nNy\nidl\nLa\nLi\nit\n\\|\n|\nLe\n| wy\n|\nra\nt\nwy\nair &\nla\n|\n[\n| ive lle\n—\n|\n== ||\n==\n|\n—=\n“I\n7 gal\nNy aaa (|\nWh\nfl\n|\nH\noo |\n\\\n—.\n>\ni\n==,\na\nMain Obstacles and Corresponding Strategies\npie lf\n|\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey Q2\nil\ni\n——\\—",

These labels also complement the new eco-design directive released by the EU that aims to promote better environmental performance through reparability and recyclability of appliances. Some of these new eco-design measures include making spare parts more easily replaceable and ensuring that key parts and repair and maintenance information are available for users and repairers for at least 7 to 10 years. This new legislation also reinforces the idea that waste is a design flaw; thus, circularity measures need to be taken at the early stages of design in order to minimize waste and prolong products’ life spans. Products would not be approved for sale unless they complied with these directives in EU.2°°\nAccording to the Special Eurobarometer 492%” in 2019, 93% of European consumers recognized the energy labels and 79% considered it when buying new products.?9%”\nHowever, these labels lost their performance over time. As new technologies developed and spread, every year more products were qualified as Grade A or above, meaning that existing indicators did not highlight out-performing products. For instance, around two-thirds of refrigerators and washing machines sold in 2006 were labelled as Class A, whereas over 90% of those sold in 2017 were labelled A+, A++ or A+++. To commit to higher levels of efficiency per the Paris Agreement, it was a necessity to rescale the standards and downgrade most of these products. This will also add more heat to the R&D competition within the sector.\nLabel2020 redefines qualifications to make home appliances more circular. The grading will be done only with letters and ‘+’ will be dropped. A simple alphabetical grading from ‘A’ to ‘G’ has been set to illustrate a clearer picture for quality variance. Fridges, freezers, dishwashers, washing machines and televisions have been prioritized in the labeling transition process that started in March of 2021, while other products will be transitioned later.\nThe new generation labels also highlight the importance of having accessible information; in order to sell in the European markets, producers must upload their products on to the European Product Database for Energy Labelling.'°® Consumers and sellers will be able to pull up this information via the OR codes on the labels; with information at people's fingertips, more conscious purchases can be made. One other change has been reducing the text on the labels and relaying information through symbols and numbers to create a uniform understanding of the grading scale that is not language biased.?°* As circular economy indicates; strong communication networks need to be established to optimize circular practices. Label2020 has been designed to be easily accessible and has eliminated language barriers with the assistance of a strong visual design to ensure information is relayed effectively.\nBy incorporating novel digital solutions, updating the grading scale to be more legible and competitive, stating requirements for reusability and recyclability for the first time and enforcing the directive on a large scale, the new rulings will not only contribute towards reducing GHG emissions but will also provide economic benefits to consumers and producers alike. The EU legislations for energy labels and eco-design are expected to bring energy savings of around 230 Mtoe by 2030 For households, this translates to average savings of up to EUR 285 per year on their energy bills.\n8” Eurobarometers\nare surveys\n88 EPREL\nto gather the public opinion in the European Union\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 38",

Utility of products can be maximized if the demand for that product does not cover the entire life cycle but just the time it’s needed. Sharing and rental systems can be better utilized if brands guarantee day-one quality through refurbishing. Demand for virgin materials will be reduced via the re-use model and the increased recycled content of these appliances. Furthermore, circularity in this project will be reinforced through communication: manufacturer's communication with the clients until the end of the lifecycle will keep these appliances away from waste streams and the partnership with Circularise will increase the materials traceability.\nImplementing smart glass into ovens will help EU reach its goal of 60% PJ/a energy savings by 2030.

According to the OECD, every year construction materials and the building sector are responsible for more than one-third of all resource consumption in the world and account for 36% of global final energy use.%*' 32? Buildings also generate excessive levels of waste, comprising around 40% of municipal urban waste in some countries.°23 Enforcing laws and facilitating systems to manage this waste is crucial for establishing sustainable communities.\nOne focus of the European Commission has been increasing renovation and refurbishment rates. Only 1% of buildings in Europe undergo energy efficiency renovations every year — The Renovation Wave intends to increase that rate to improve buildings while creating new job opportunities.°24 Additionally, the European Commission published Circular Economy Principles for Building Design to guide those in the construction value chain on circular practices; the strategies highlighted on that guide have also influenced the findings of this report. 376\nCOP26 reaffirmed the environmental impact of the construction industry.

On top of this, Turkey also lies on the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt, one of the most active earthquake zones. 92% of Turkey’s land is on a seismic belt and about 95% of the population reside there.** In Istanbul alone, of the 1.2 million buildings, 42% do not meet the requirements to withstand an earthquake the size of 7.5 as a result of uncontrolled developments.’ To avoid a catastrophe, government and private sectors have come together to reconstruct risky buildings while offering sustainable finance modules as a part of the initiative “Urban Renewal”. While the aim is to create stable structures for sustainable communities, the price of reconstruction will be higher consumption of raw materials which highlights the importance of durability as a pillar of circularity.\nStructures used to outlive their architects but now the opposite is becoming more prevalent. Buildings are being torn down prematurely to make way for new investments which generates an avoidable demand for resources. In October 2021, the government released its first regulation dedicated to demolition, ‘Directive on Building Demolition’®° but there are no laws or regulations that prevent developers from taking down a structure prematurely. Additionally, upgrades should be prioritized over knockdowns via penalties, financial incentives and tax regulations.\nCOVID-19 served as a good example of the importance of designing versatile buildings. Anticipating changes in demand and culture ensure optimizing the utility of a structure; so, architects and construction companies need to work together to design multi-purpose buildings. While the effect of work-from-home is expected to have long lasting impact on demand for real estate with many offices now downsizing, other social changes are influential too. Women’s economic empowerment, delay in marriages and changes in average household size are just some of the social changes that affect the type of real estate that is in demand.\nStructures should accommodate different preferences to ensure that they do not lose their utility.\nEven if they are not environmentally friendly, demolitions and new developments still provide some social benefits: employment for unskilled labour. Considering the size of the construction industry, their lobby remains as one of the main obstacles in achieving circularity in some regions. In Turkey, of the nearly 27.5 million people employed country wide, more than 1.7 million of them were working in the construction sector in 2020.°*' To avoid a rise in unemployment as a result of slowing down developments, it will be necessary to investment in those workers’ skillsets to support the workers’ transition to a new sector.\nIn a circular model, waste is treated as a design flaw, which means that intervention is needed at the earlier stages of production to design out waste and pollution.%3* For the construction industry, this could include a change in the material sourcing criteria and promotion of products with a lower environmental footprint. By integrating recycled content without compromising quality, the use of primary resources can be minimized. Designers should also avoid using materials that contain harmful substances or cause significant pollution in their life cycles. Modular, flexible structures that are easy to assemble or disassemble can help reduce waste and consumption, considering how such structures and materials used in those structures will have higher recovery potentials through recycling, refurbishing, remanufacturing and repairing. Developing durable materials is another aspect of circularity in the building sector. If materials and structures are resilient against external factors such as time, weather, earthquake and fires, buildings and infrastructures values can be preserved for a longer time.\n8° Rate of urbanization: the flow of population from the peripheries to cities 80 Binalarin Yikilmasi Hakkinda YOnetmelik\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 94",

Lastly, buildings should be built with a consideration for its location. Focusing on bioclimatic and biophilic design practices will not only bring building occupants closer to the natural environment and provide a healthier indoor climate but also reduce emissions during its use since the design incorporate the elements present in the building’s environment.?*4\nIn Turkey, according to the “Energy Efficiency Law No. 5627” and the “Energy Performance Regulation in Buildings”, energy and energy resources need to be consumed efficiently. Energy Performance Certificate - which contains information about a building's energy requirement and energy consumption classification, insulation properties and efficiency of heating and/or cooling systems - is used as a Minimum standard, in order to ensure the efficient use of energy, prevention of energy waste and protection of the environment.

Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) comprises of materials recovered from milling or demolition of roadways before new asphalt mix is applied. Since asphalt is traditionally mixed in with bitumen, a non- renewable petroleum based raw material that acts as the liquid binder which holds the asphalt together, this practice has both economic and environmental gains.\nColas Ile-de-France Normandie, an affiliate of Colas, has been working on utilizing construction waste recovered from buildings and not just roads. The affiliate has a network of around 40 facilities (recycling platforms, sorting platforms for commercial users, clean waste storage facilities) and its specialized affiliate Premys has been making progress on secondary elements\" waste. They empty out and selectively remove specialized materials (ferrous and non-ferrous metals, computer room flooring, wooden flooring, wooden beams, false ceilings, furniture, etc.) in buildings due for demolition, and turn them into a source of raw materials or equipment. Moreover, Premys is currently testing solutions for selling products from recovered demolition waste (doors, windows, false ceilings, insulation, etc.) to private individuals and trades people.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 4Q4\nImpact\nRecovered aggregates produced 9.2 million metric tons of recycled materials in 2019, which corresponds to about 10% of the Group’s total production from its quarries and gravel pits. Reducing raw material consumption by increasing recycled content ratio yielded savings equivalent to the average production of 47 Colas quarries.\nAs global economies shift away from petroleum and other carbon-based raw materials, bitumen\"°” becomes harder to obtain since its supply depends on demand and supply of crude oil. In 2019, 6.2 million metric tons of reclaimed asphalt was reused and 16% of new asphalt mixes had recycled asphalt mixes; savings from this practice was the same as the annual bitumen production of a medium-sized refinery. By reducing and reusing waste, energy savings increase while emissions and cost decrease.\nAt Colas Ile-de-France Normandie, 1.6 million metric tons of materials were recycled including 290,000 metric tons of reclaimed asphalt pavement from the demolition of former road surfaces. In 2019, the company completed the massive project to fully rebuild runway number 3 at Paris Orly airport in only 14 weeks using 300,000 metric tons of recycled materials",

  "page_107": "/ Areas of collaboration DeLWeEN France and TUKEY\nOne of the aims of this report, supported by the French Development Agency (AFD), has been to advocate circularity initiatives in Turkey by guiding international partnerships. In that light, propositions for circular collaboration strategies between Turkey and France have been presented in this section.\nFrench and Turkish organizations could develop platforms to share best circular economy practices such as “designforlongetivity”, a platform produced by Global Fashion Agenda as part of the European Clothing Action Plan (ECAP) that aims to drive sustainability throughout the entire lifecycle of clothing via communicating companies’ best practices, new innovations and training. Similar platforms already exist, so, to be truly efficient and reach their target audience, this platform should consider the specifics of Turkish sectors. These could include financial incentives that companies could benefit from by implementing circular projects such as green bonds, tax refunds, subsidies and lines of credit in addition to the conditions to fulfil.\nFrench companies could encourage their Turkish suppliers to adopt circular economy practices through the integration of circular economy criteria in the supplier selection process. Standards could be set for % of recycled material used or energy and water management systems. To help Turkish suppliers improve on these criteria and meet the requirements, French companies could also help them build capacity through sharing tools and knowledge.\nFrench companies could establish collection systems in the main countries where they sell their products. If consumers are incentivized (e.g. coupons) to bring in their old products back to stores, companies can take these items back to factories for refurbishing or remanufacturing. Assessing the environmental and economic cost of reverse logistics would be crucial to determine the sustainability of such initiatives. Supply chains can be shortened by building local factories or working with local actors to reduce the environmental impact of transporting used goods.\nFrench and Turkish organizations could develop shared platforms where actors from the whole value chain could connect and better manage resources avoiding waste. For example, Upcyclea in France has developed a collaborative software of circular resource management in the construction sector. The idea is to transform assets into a digital bank of products and materials that can be reused or upcycled. The business model of these platforms would apply to all sectors.\nTurkey could integrate existing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) at European level (e.g. packaging, electronic waste, batteries). EPR system is based on the “polluter pays” principle in which producers are held responsible of reducing the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle; thus, they are expected to support during take-back, recycling and final disposal phases. It makes the producer accountable for financing end-of-life cost, providing incentives to producers to prevent waste at the source and design products that are recyclable/reusable. Turkey could improve their EPR standards, following their initiative on Recycling Contribution Fee (GEKAP). Some French organizations such as the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) could support countries in the establishment of an EPR approach and the creation of an eco-organism and manage the project with local actors.\nTurkey's representatives could join working groups to better understand the legislative developments at European level. The European Commission is adopting new action plans (e.g. CEAP) alongside introducing legislative and non-legislative measures targeting sustainable growth and circular economy principles. Although itis led by the European Commission, the EU can only succeed if its efforts drive also the global transition to a just, climate-neutral, resource-efficient and circular economy. There is a growing need to advance discussions on defining a “Safe Operating Space” whereby the use of various natural resources does not exceed certain local, regional or global thresholds and environmental impacts remain within planetary boundaries. For countries with an EU accession perspective like Turkey, the new sustainable models will open up business and employment opportunities, while strengthening the ties with European economic actors. Turkish stakeholders should monitor the upcoming regulations to adopt and update their national strategies, plans and measures in light of European Commission's new ambitions.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 4Q7",

  "page_109": "6 Barriers and Uapaortunites\nBarriers\nSeveral obstacles, some of which vary from sector to sector, hindered data collection. Most significant barriers are given as follows:\ne Data deficiencies e Confidentiality of relevant data e Lack of protocols for enforcing circularity principles Lack of regulations for mandating reporting Low of awareness of circularity principles Lack of data for products’ LCAs e Restraints imposed by customers e Unavailability of certified circular inputs\nDuring Phase 1, which primarily focused on the nation-wide assessment of the production phase, a salient obstacle was obtaining data. Information regarding certain materials are not available in some sectors due to confidentiality. The datasets are not always compatible with principles of circularity either. For instance, data is collected within companies and Turkey for recycling, but other circularity strategies are not tracked. Also, companies and nations’ datasets focus are more on weight, quantity and economic value — circularity related KPIs need to be monitored as well. It Should be noted that plastic packaging and textile sectors had better circularity data publicly available, a sign that circularity principles are being applied. However, considering how most of the data available has come from companies that have initiated circular strategies in their operations, the circularity numbers calculated are assumed to be higher than the industry average.\nTo remove barriers regarding data availability, in parallel to “An Overall Assessment of the Potential of Turkey in the Context of Transition to Circular Economy Project” led by Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, it would be beneficial to prepare and publish a National Circularity Action Plan which will serve as a guidance for companies and include requirements to establish systems for monitoring and reporting data submitted by companies.\nLack of awareness regarding circularity data is another concern that impedes data collection. While many institutions are impassioned about sustainability, only a few monitor relevant KPls. Effective management is critical for raising awareness within a company. Our research revealed that most companies’ senior managements are still not focusing on circularity strategies; the knowledge of such strategies is still limited with recycling for most departments. Additionally, since circularity principles rely on strong network within the value chain, effective governance that spreads the knowledge of circularity strategies should permeate the entire market.\nSafety, hygiene and quality standards and specs, agreeably, can pace circular economy developments. There are strict standards that have to be met in food packages, automotive, construction and home appliance sectors to ensure that the products are safe, durable and hygienic. These quality standards result in certain restrictions in the design stage, which affects products actual and potential recoverability rates at the end of their lifecycle.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 109",
  "page_110": "Clients’ design expectations, supply chain’s capacity, sourcing problems can limit the circularity of products. Some clients’ orders have rigid standards, whether it be for clothing, buildings or small electronics, which means that manufacturers cannot change the inflows or designs to make a product more circular. As for the supply chain, if circular inflows are not available in the Turkish market, such as certified recycled textiles or second-hand electrical equipment, manufacturers will not be able to transition to a sustainable supply chain. Obtaining such inflows from different countries can negate some of the environmental benefits of using circular inflows due to emissions from transportation.\nMaking services, products and operations more circular can be expensive in the short run. Many firms, especially manufacturing businesses, face financial barriers when investing in innovative, greener and more resource efficient technologies. Some organizations also do not allocate a high budget for their R&D departments, which can support the development of circular innovations.\nSome fiscal policies do not consider circular applications. For instance, when textile scraps and by-products are used as secondary inputs in manufacturing operations and these output materials lose their waste feature, the manufacturer has to pay 18% of VAT on delivery of these materials. This law also applies to rubber, paper, metals, plastics and glass.\nA competitive market has had an equivocal role in the development of circular strategies and the transparency of KPIs. While such market characteristics push companies to invest more in R&D, they also raise barriers in the form of patents that secure the profitability of such investments. Especially in sectors such as home appliances and automotive, companies refrained from participating in the study due to this concern.\nOptimizing a Circular Economy\nEducation will be pivotal for developing circular solutions since such improvements rely on the capacity of the human capital. Educational institutions will need to develop more in-depth curriculums that target circular economy principles. If organizations want to ensure the longevity of their businesses, they will need to catalyse their employees’ growth through capacity building. For the general public, education entails shaping and abating demand via awareness campaigns.\nParallel to this, human resources at organizations should focus on finding candidates with qualities that can support their organizations’ sustainability initiatives, both technically and strategically. It is important to note that circularity principles are all-encompassing, and all departments should be educated on these topics. For instance, in textiles industry, design teams will need to understand which styles, patterns, blends and textiles have higher recovery potentials while the procurement department will need to know which KPIs to assess while purchasing new materials and goods. Concomitantly, R&D with a focus on circular practices should be another strategic objective. Institutions should allocate more budget for innovations that target circularity principles.\nInnovations in digitalization provide solutions in countless functions and industries. World Economic Forum’s analysis shows that 84% of Internet of Things (loT) applications either are already applicable, or are potentially applicable, for supporting SDGs. Increasing real-time connectivity between previously separate entities can increase efficiency in resource consumption alongside accurately quantifying the enablement effect'\"® 37°. For instance, consolidating information from on- site humidity sensors and weather forecasts can assist cotton farmers with optimizing water consumption during irrigation.[i] Another example of innovative information technology are OR codes and blockchain technology. These can act as digital passports for materials and products by storing information pertaining to their supply chain journey, circularity, optimal disposal method and potentially much more. They not only increase traceability and accountability but also provide valuable information to optimize circularity in the value chain.?”\nOptimizing circularity also relies on a strong infrastructure and network. For instance, disseminating local recycling facilities and improving collecting schemes will require the coalition of municipalities, financial institutions, manufacturers and end-users. This type of network should also enable transferring products, materials and waste within and between consumers and producers to increase the application of circularity strategies other than recycling.\n\"0 Mechanisms that facilitate the avoidance of carbon emissions\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 44Q",
  "page_111": "Aligning laws and regulations with circularity principles will increase industry participation and preserve Turkey’s environment. Banning the incineration of recoverable materials, implementing fiscal policies that incentivize sustainable investments while limiting environmentally detrimental activities, and enforcing stricter policies regarding circular practices are some ways to advance nation-wide circular economy practices. Zero Waste Regulation is a great example of the potency of such regulations; since its implementation in 2018, it has raised awareness, improved data collection and increased collection of recyclable wastes throughout the nation. Regulations regarding patents need to be re-evaluated as well: the positive and negative impact of IP laws should be considered to accelerate sustainable innovations.\nFinally, reporting and reliable data sets are the backbone of governance. Without an established and sweeping dataset, interpretations of companies, industries and countries’ performances will be challenged. Tracking, understanding and utilizing these KPls will help consumers, businesses, investors, financial institutions and regulators make more sustainable decisions.\nSeizing Opportunities in a Circular Economy\nFor Companies:\ne Increasing the circularity of inputs, by using more materials recovered via remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling and upcycling, provides multitude of benefits\nO An organizations’ Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions will decrease. O Profits can increase in the short and long run. e Substituting linear inputs with circular ones, such as waste streams, can reduce procurement related costs. e There may be monetary and fiscal incentives that support the switch to a circular business case. O Supply chain related risks are curtailed since sustainable inputs are more reliable, especially in the long run. O Implementing processes and technologies that utilize a company’s own waste and by-products shortens supply chains. Innovation is key to realizing and increasing recovery potential. O Water management technologies like reverse osmosis, rainwater harvesting, and brine treatment reduce a company’s demand for water. In regions where water crises is already looming, such innovations will reduce the demand on scarce resources and support local biodiversity. Innovations, such as green cement and bioplastics, can increase the circularity of inputs. 3D printing is an auspicious technology for reducing inputs, waste, emissions and costs in addition to shortening supply chains. Firms can be more flexible with their inouts when they use 3D printing and supply chains can become more efficient. e In the construction sector, bamboo and plastic waste can be used as building materials. 3D printing structures is not labour-intensive, and some projects can be completed within days; lowering labour and energy related costs makes such projects more feasible which will be critical in ameliorating the housing crises. Products’ repairability potential can be increased. In industries where spare parts are in demand such as home appliance sector, components can be printed on demand in stores or even consumers’ houses. This way, parts or equipment would not be manufactured in excess, products’ lifetimes would be prolonged, supply chains would be shortened and demand for storage space reduced.\ne\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 44]",
  "page_112": "0 Shifting the focus of research and development to circular economy principles will: e Make companies more resilient to changes in the market e Make companies leaders in sustainability initiatives, which are still at a relatively early stage in Turkey e Increase efficiency and decrease products’ environmental footprint Private and public organizations can work together via associations, events and councils. Communication will be integral in advancing good practices, sharing resources and optimizing the flow of materials. By engaging with their supply chains and customers to gather data on the circularity of their inputs and outputs, companies will collect better information on making their products more efficient and sustainable. Sustainability is becoming more salient for publicly traded companies as stock market indexes consider ESG KPls and non-financial assets more. Growing number of stock exchanges are mandating non-financial reporting and other sustainability related criteria.\nFor the Authorities:\ne Harmonizing regulations, directives and roadmaps with markets that have stricter ESG standards will ensure that Turkish companies stay competitive in those markets. o Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), are some of the developments in the European market that will have major implications on trade. Turkey is currently working on its Circular Economy Transition Project™” which aims to strengthen Turkey's institutional and technical capacity of Turkey in line with the EU Circular Economy Package. o Developing and publishing a circular economy action plan will accelerate the Turkey's transition to circular economy. Issuing new regulations and policies, updating existing ones and increasing audits can endorse a circular economy. O Minimum standards for circular practices will be elevated throughout the nation. O Organizations’ Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions will be reduced, which will help Turkey achieve its climate goals. O While many regulations exist that promote recycling, they can be expanded to promote other circular economy strategies that target the final stages of a product's lifecycle, such as remanufacture, refurbish and repurpose. Tracking and reporting system that includes KPls related with circularity can be established. o Accurate and sweeping datasets will result in more reliable assessments and realistic goals which will attract more investment. 0 Traceability system for products’ LCAs in all sectors will make it possible to estimate Turkey's circularity rate. Increasing monetary incentives such as tax credits, tax abatements, tax exemptions, subsidies and loans at lower interest rates for circular initiatives will pave the way for new investments, circular business models and R&D.\n1 An Overall Assessment of the Potential of Turkey in the Context of\nTransition to Circular Economy Project\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 442",
  "page_113": "e\nExpanding supports economy strategies O Increasing the number of strategically located collection facilities and sorting/recycling centres will exploit economies of scale and increase products’ end- of-life recovery potentials. 0 Providing an ecosystem for industrial symbiosis will optimize the flow of materials and information within and among sectors. e Circular initiatives will generate green jobs and support the national economy. e Implementing nation-wide circular solutions will support SDGs, lower emissions, limit biodiversity loss and reduce resource consumption. This will lower the impact of historical linear consumption on communities, the economy and natural assets, which will facilitate a more sustainable ecosystem for businesses and people's livelinood.\nFor Financial Institutions (some major categories include central banks, retail and commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies, credit unions, savings and loans associations, brokerage firms and insurance companies):\ne No circular economy transition can be realized without sustainable finance; generating funds for circular strategy investments is one of the pillars of a sustainable economy. O For example, from transition to low-carbon transportation to creating “superblocks”, finance sector’s contribution holds a pivotal position. O Sustainable finance market is growing in the Turkish market and all related regulatory bodies such as BBDK and Ministry of Treasury and Finance have published Sustainable Finance related frameworks, guidelines or action plans. Upcoming taxonomy and legal framework studies will boost sustainable investment in Turkish market. O In 2021, green bonds accounted for USD 836 million of the USD 3.1 billion bond market in Turkey. O New business models, such as sharing models, is pushing insurance companies to device new insurance solutions. EU Taxonomy has an important role in scaling up sustainable investments; it serves as a guidance on six environmental objectives which includes the transition to circular economy. Financial institutions need to reconcile ESG topics, including circularity, with finance to make more sound deals and transactions in addition to more accurate portfolio and risk assessments. o Circular actions taken by businesses and individuals should be factored into assessments since circularity principles cushion the direct and indirect impact of linear consumption and reduce the likelihood of defaults. Circularity concept provides a methodology of quantifying environmental performance. O New tools and methodologies need to be employed to quantify portfolios and clients’ environmental risks and performances. For example, BBVA has developed its own carbon footprint calculator for its clients. Making these data more commonplace will help stakeholders understand and compare results within and across sectors. For instance, the methodology used in this report is designed to measure a business's circularity and it can be used to determine whether an investment is paying off in terms of circularity principles. The Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) is another tool that can assess a financial institution's portfolio’s alignment with climate scenarios.\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 113\ninfrastructure that\ncircular\nwill increase efficiency.",
  "page_114": "e Financial institutions can implement circular solutions in their direct operations.\ne Partnerships or diversifying business operations can generate new revenue streams. Some banks are already expanding their services by facilitating office equipment rentals and shared office space schemes. With hybrid and remote work becoming more standardized, financial intuitions that once used to occupy vast real estate can apply circular principles to spaces that are becoming obsolete. Some banks like Akbank are now switching to circular inputs such as recycled materials to make their credit cards. Banks can engage with their own value chains to facilitate such projects. Supporting and investing in their portfolio’s transition to a circular economy will improve financial institutions’ ESG and financial performance. while mitigating climate, policy, reputation and trade related risks. o Financial institutions can lower their Scope 3 emissions. o For organizations that have committed to initiatives such as CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) and SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative), circularity related ameliorations in the value chain will be integral for materializing their commitments. Financial institutions can partner with other companies in their portfolios to finance the company’s supply chain transformation which would boost both organizations’ CDP and SBT performances. With their vast network and expertise in quantifying risks and opportunities, financial institutions can catalyse change and realize Paris Agreement’s mission “to leave no one behind”. o They can support or lead sectoral studies, events and competitions to improve circularity within industries.

Inout materials are the sum of non-renewable, renewable and secondary materials used in production, as classified based on the following definitions:\nNon-renewable materials (tonnes): This is the weight of input that has neither been previously used or consumed (virgin) nor is it renewable. Therefore, for these materials, circularity is 0%.\nRenewable materials (tonnes): Renewable input is the weight of sustainably managed resource that is replenished/regrown after extraction. Input can consist of either fully or partially of renewable content. Thus, in this case, % circularity input is the % renewable material content.\nSecondary materials (tonnes): Secondary material is the weight of previously recovered non-virgin or secondary (reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled) materials. Input can consist of either fully or partially of renewable content. Hence, in this case, % circularity input is the % recovered content.\nIn the event input is both renewable and secondary, it is counted only once in the input in order to prevent double counting.\n% circular output\nThis ratio assesses the circularity rate of output materials. Output materials are the sum of products, by-products and waste generated during and after production and are as classified based on following definitions:\nProduct (tonnes): These are the weight of the target output of the manufacturing activities.\nBy-product (tonnes): |n some sectors and companies, weight of by-products were included in calculations if data was available.\nWaste (tonnes): These are the weight of outputs of the manufacturing activities that, based on a linear model, no longer have economic\nutility.\n% Potential ratio of recovery: This is the potential recoverability rate of outputs based on how they were designed and treated in a way that they can be recovered on a technical, material level at end of life. Recovery design solutions can include disassembly, repairability and recyclability. Recovery potential refers to material recovery but does not include energy recovery.\n% Actual recovery: This is the realized recovery rate of outputs that leave the organization and actually find their way back into the value chain (either the same or a different value chain) and covers products, by-products, and waste). Recovery is different from collection. After collection, materials can still end up in landfill or incinerated. For this reason, this indicator is not based on estimates but requires actual data and in case no data is available the actual recovery is deemed to be 0%\nRecovery strategies include reuse, repair, refurbish, reourpose, remanufacture, recycle and biodegrade. At present, the methodology for calculating circularity does not distinguish between these recovery strategies used and they all contribute at the same weight to the circularity performance. Nevertheless, tighter loops (Such as reuse) are more efficient forms of recovery and allow materials to maintain their inherent value better than larger loops (such as recycling). Recovery strategies include the following:\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 447",
  "page_118": "Reuse: To extend a product's lifetime beyond its intentional designed life span, without changes made to the product or its functionality.\nRepair: To extend a product's lifetime by restoring it after breakage or tearing, without changes made to the product or its functionality.\nRefurbish: To extend a product's lifetime by large repair, potentially with replacement of parts, without changes made to the product’s functionality.\nRemanufacture: To disassemble a product to the component level and reassemble (replacing components where necessary) to aS-new condition with possible changes made to the functionality of the product.\nRecycle: To reduce a product back to its material level, thereby allowing the use of those materials in new products.\nBiodegrade: Microbial (bacteria and fungi) breakdown of organic matter in the presence of oxygen to produce soil with high organic (humus) content.\nRenewable: - refers to bio-based sustainably managed resources (most often demonstrated by internationally recognized certification schemes like FSC, PEFC or RSPO) that, after extraction, return to their previous stock levels by natural growth or replenishment processes at a rate in line with use cycles. Therefore, they are replenished or regrown at a faster rate than harvested/extracted.\nRenewable Energy: - Energy is considered Renewable Energy if it is solar, wind, water, geothermal, tidal or if it comes from sustainably managed bio-based resources (demonstrated by certification), which are harvested at a lower rate than at which natural growth/replenishment occurs and from residues and/or by- products.\nCircularity Calculation Formula:\nWeight of circular output (tons) = weight of renewable input + weight of secondary (non-virgin) input\n% Circularity rate of input = (weight of renewable input + weight of secondary (non-virgin) input) / total weight of all input x100\nWeight of circular output (tons) = Total weight of output x % recovery potential x % actual recovery\n% Circularity rate of output = Weight of circular output/ Total weight of output x 100\n% Actual Recovery of output = Weight of actual recovered output/ Weight of output x 100\n% Recovery Potential = Weight of potentially recoverable output / total weight of output x 100 (ranging from 0% If not recoverable, to 100% If fully\nrecoverable\nKey Circular Strategies\nFor each of the sectors covered by this study, key strategies that can be applied within Turkey's context were selected. Strategies were aligned with the material flows at three key intervention points as defined by the circularity calculation methodology and as outlined below. Material flows can include nutrients, compounds, materials, parts, components or even products. By analysing these flows, an organization can determine its ability and ambition to minimize resource extraction and waste material.\nCircular Input: Circular resources, materials, products and parts sourced\nOutput - Recovery Potential: Biodegradable materials and designs that allow technical recovery of components and materials (e.g., by designing for disassembly, repairability, recyclability, etc.)\nOutput - Actual Recovery: Products, by-products and waste-streams that are recovered for closed-loop applications or open loop recovery schemes\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 448",

Refuse: Make product redundant by abandoning its function or by offering the same function by a radically different (e.g. digital) product or service.\n1. Rethink: Make product use more intensive (e.g. through product-as-a-service, reuse and sharing models or by putting multi-functional products on the market).\n2. Reduce: Increase efficiency in product manufacture or use by consuming fewer natural resources and materials.\n3. Re-use: Re-use of a product which is still in good condition and fulfils its original function (and is not waste) for the same purpose for which it was conceived.\n4. Repair: Repair and maintenance of defective product so it can be used with its original function.\n5. Refurbish: Restore an old product and bring it up to date (to specified quality level).\n6. Remanufacture: Use parts of a discarded product in a new product with the same function (and as-new-condition).\n7. Repurpose: Use a redundant product or its parts in a new product with different function.\n8. Recycle: Recover materials from waste to be reprocessed into new products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.\n9. Recover: Incinerate materials and waste for energy production\nTypes of Circular Projects:\n1. Circular Design and Production Model: These activities increase resource efficiency through design innovation, process innovation, process re-engineering and/or material innovation and substitution. These changes are implemented at the earlier stages of production, but their benefits are reaped usually towards the end of the lifecycle.\n2. Circular Use Model: Efficiency is increased via product and asset lifecycle extension based on reuse, repair, repurposing, refurbishment or remanufacturing strategies and/or product and asset use-optimizing leasing and sharing models. These activities take place during or at the end of the use phase.\n3. Circular Value Recovery Model: Waste is recovered for reuse, recycling or other circular economy strategies to increase efficiency. This process takes place at the after-use phase of the products or assets.\n4. Circular Support: These enable other circular activities and project to indirectly contribute to increasing resource efficiency.\n10.3 Appendix 3: Key Sources for data used in the circular performance calculations for sectors covered by this study\nPreliminary Research On Circularity Potential Of Five Sectors In Turkey 119",
