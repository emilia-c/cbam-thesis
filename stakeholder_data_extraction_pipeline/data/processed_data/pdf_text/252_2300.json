  "page_2": "EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\nCONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n1\nReasons for and objectives of the proposal\ne\nIn his report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness’, Mario Draghi emphasised the need for Europe to create a regulatory landscape which facilitates competitiveness and resilience!. In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs’*. Multiple companies and stakeholders have voiced their concerns about the administrative burden resulting from a number of EU acts, including Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM Regulation’).\nIn its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would deliver an unprecedented simplification effort to achieve the agreed policy objectives in the simplest, most targeted, most effective and least burdensome way. In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground, requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules’.\nAdministrative requirements, including reporting requirements, play a key role in ensuring correct enforcement and proper monitoring of legislation. Generally, their costs are largely offset by the benefits they bring. However, reporting requirements can also impose disproportionate burdens on stakeholders, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-companies.\nThis proposal will deliver simplifications and cost-efficient improvements to the CBAM Regulation without affecting the achievement of objectives in this policy area. The proposed measures will not undermine the environmental objective of CBAM, rather the measures will enable a more efficient CBAM while the key design principles of the mechanism will remain unchanged.\nThe proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which rely on complex calculations and data collection processes which would hamper the CBAM’s effective implementation.\nIn addition, the proposal will strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is\nEN\nBudapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, 8 November 2024.\n“The future of European competitiveness”, September 2024.\nRegulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p 52,\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/o}).\nReference to be added when published\nEN",

It will also enable the Commission to better detect risks and the national competent authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed\nFinally, simplifying the mechanism will also be a key enabler for a potential future scope extension. In the second half of 2025, the Commission will present a comprehensive CBAM review report as provided in Article 30 of the CBAM regulation, which will pave the way for a potential extension of the CBAM scope\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\ne\nThis proposal is part of a package of measures aiming at simplifying reporting requirements by looking comprehensively at existing requirements, with a view to assess their continued relevance and to make them more efficient. It builds on existing rules from the CBAM Regulation, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the reporting obligations for the transitional period’ and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3210 of 18 December 2024 laying down rules for the CBAM registry\nConsistency with other Union policies\ne\nThe proposal is consistent with the objectives of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while avoiding the costs (both for the Commission and the entities providing the information) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means\n2\nLEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\nLegal basis\ne\nThe proposal amends an existing regulation. Therefore, the legal basis for the proposal is the same as the legal basis of the amended Regulation, namely Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’) in the area of environment protection\nIn accordance with Articles 191 and 192(1) of TFEU, the Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change\nSubsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\ne\nThe CBAM Regulation created a common uniform framework ensuring an equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports\nThe simplifications to that regulation envisaged by this proposal will further enhance legal certainty and rationalise the reporting requirements\n5 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards reporting obligations for the purposes of the carbon border adjustment mechanism during the transitional period (OJ L 228, 15.9.2023, p. 94, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/1773/o}).\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3210 of 18 December 2024 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the CRAM registry (OJ 30.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_imp1/2024/3210/o})\nEN\nEN",
  "page_4": "e\nProportionality\nThe simplification of administrative requirements, including reporting requirements, simplifies the legal framework by introducing changes to existing requirements that do not affect the substance of the policy objectives. The proposal is therefore limited to those changes that are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and to ensure compliance in a more efficient manner without changing the substance of the legislation concerned.\nThe proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality as it does not go beyond what is necessary to meet the objectives of the Treaties. The proportionality of the proposal has a number of important aspects.\nFirstly, it is recognised that it is challenging for importers to deal with the CBAM reporting requirements while at the same time Member States’ competent authorities must carry out important supervision tasks. This will be mitigated by introducing a threshold to exempt from CBAM obligations certain importers.\nSecondly, for importers within the CBAM scope, the proposal contains changes to the reporting requirements, targeting those which are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and ensure compliance in a more efficient manner.\nChoice of the instrument\ne\nThe proposal requires amending the CBAM Regulation. It lays down the specific rules necessary for the simplified application of certain provisions of the CBAM Regulation, where the goals pursued cannot be reached through the adoption of implementing measures as they require amending basic provisions of the CBAM Regulation. This concerns the de minimis derogation, the reporting obligations, the calculation of embedded emissions and the calculation of the financial adjustment.\n3\nRESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nSTAKEHOLDER\nEx-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\ne\nThe proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing the CBAM Regulation since the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.\ne\nStakeholder consultations\nSince the CBAM started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023, the Commission Services have continuously been consulting stakeholders in the Union and in third countries relevant for CBAM via multiple communication channels. In 2023, the Commission Services renewed the mandate of the expert group on CBAM’ whose mission is to assist the Commission services in the development and implementation of the CBAM, harness technical expertise and bring exchanges of experience and good practices in CBAM implementation.\nIn 2023, the Commission Services also launched a broad communication campaign to raise awareness about CBAM including in third countries, explain the rules and provide useful advice in how CBAM could be implemented by the relevant stakeholders (such as importers,\n7 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert- groups/consult?lang=en&groupID=3927\nEN\nEN",
  "page_5": "third country producers, national authorities). This communication campaign relied on publicly available live webinars in several EU languages. Useful materials have been provided on the CBAM-dedicated webpage’: targeted e-learning materials, Q&A, guidance (also translated to non-EU official languages).\nThe Commission was also in regular contact with national competent authorities for CBAM, to discuss various issues concerning implementation of CBAM, with a view to improve its functioning and effectiveness.\nOn 6 February 2025, the Commission hosted a high-level consultation day with key stakeholders to test the main ideas of the legislative package on simplification on targeted policies, including the CBAM, and to collect input and feedback ahead of its adoption on 26 February 2025.\nBased on these actions and repeated public meetings with relevant business representatives from the Union and third countries, the Commission Services have collected sufficient feedback from stakeholders to adopt the best measures to achieve the objective of the proposal: simplify the complex reporting rules to reduce the compliance burden and ensure CBAM is efficiently rolled out while preserving its environmental objective and climate objective.\nCollection and use of expertise\ne\nThe proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing reporting obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the data collected through the quarterly CBAM report submitted by declarants. Since this is a step in the process of continuous assessment of reporting requirements in Union legislations, the scrutiny of such burdens and of their impact on stakeholders will continue in the future.\nImpact assessment\ne\nThe proposal concerns targeted changes of the CBAM Regulation to simplify some of its requirements, including reporting. The main measures are based on experience in implementing this Regulation and abovementioned related implementing acts. The proposed targeted changes ensure a more efficient and effective implementation of the existing mechanism.\nThis proposal is accompanied by an analytical document, the Commission Staff Working Document (SWD) “Towards a simpler and more effective Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism”. The analytical document builds on and further complements the analysis carried out in the original impact assessment conducted in 2021.\nRegulatory fitness and simplification\ne\nIn the 2021 impact assessment accompanying the CBAM legislative proposal'®, the Commission concluded that, since CBAM is initially applied to imports of selected basic materials and their products, large businesses would be the primary ones affected, but that in practice the CBAM would result in relatively higher compliance costs for small and medium-\nhttps://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en XXX SWD(2021) 643 final.\n10\nEN\nEN",
  "page_6": "sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to large enterprises in scope of CBAM, e.g. those importing CBAM goods above the derogation.\nBased on the experience in implementing CBAM in its transitional phase, and on the assessment of stakeholders’ feedback since 1 October 2023, it has become clear that CBAM requires two types of main simplifications: a broader derogation from CBAM requirements of importers of very small quantities of CBAM goods, and a set of simplifications for the rest of the importers of CBAM goods to facilitate their compliance with the administrative requirements.\nThe proposed simplification is expected to exempt around 90% of importers from CBAM obligations, while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in scope of CBAM, thereby safeguarding the environmental nature of the mechanism.\nFundamental rights\ne\nThe proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter.\n4\nBUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThis proposal will have implications for the EU budget. Its impact is assessed in the legislative financial and digital statement accompanying this proposal.\n5\nOTHER ELEMENTS\nImplementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\ne\nAs the proposal amends the CBAM Regulation, it does not have additional implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements beyond the existing ones under the said Regulation.\nIt is however important to recall that the Commission will continue ensuring that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM, including its enforcement against circumvention practices, and evaluate it against the main policy objectives. Given that the CBAM is one of the policy proposals under the ‘Fit for 55 Package’ adopted by the Commission in July 2021'', monitoring and evaluation will be carried out in alignment with the other policies of the package.\nThe Commission will monitor how CBAM is implemented to feed into its analysis and will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of the CBAM Regulation. As part of that reporting, the Commission will propose possible changes to improve its functioning, collect the necessary information for a potential further extension of the scope of CBAM, including on other goods that could be at risk of carbon leakage, such as downstream products. Those reports should also contain an assessment of the impact of the CBAM on carbon leakage, including in relation to exports, and its economic, environmental, social and territorial impact throughout the Union.\n11\nCOM(2020) 690 final.\nEN\nEN",
  "page_7": "Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\ne\nThe proposal contains two types of simplifications.\nFirst, importers of small quantities of CBAM goods, which represent very small quantities of embedded emissions imported into the Union and in most cases correspond to SMEs and individuals, will be exempt from CBAM obligations. For those importers, the administrative burden resulting from compliance with CBAM obligations significantly outweighs the environmental and regulatory benefit. This is due to the combination of (1) the insignificant share of embedded emissions in all their CBAM goods imported into the Union and (ii) the inability of national authorities to enforce the rules due to the large numbers of importers of small quantities of CBAM goods.\nSecond, the proposal contains a set of simplifications for importers of CBAM goods above the threshold to facilitate their compliance with the reporting requirements. In particular, the proposal simplifies and streamlines the authorisation procedure for national competent authorities and the Commission, the data collection processes from third country producers to authorised CBAM declarants, the calculation of embedded emissions for certain goods, the emission verification rules, the calculation of the authorised CBAM declarants’ financial liability during the year of imports into the EU and the claim by authorised CBAM declarants for carbon prices paid in third countries where goods are produced.\nArticle 1(1) amends the derogation from the CBAM obligations by introducing a new mass threshold as laid out in a new Annex VII to the CBAM Regulation, to exclude importers of very small quantities of goods.\nArticle 1(2) amends the definitions of importer and operator to facilitate reporting requirements.\nArticles 1(3) and 1(4), point (b), draw the consequences of the new threshold on the rules related to the authorisation that importers must be granted to import goods above that threshold, and provide for the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants, which remain legally responsible of their CBAM obligations, to technically delegate in the CBAM Registry the reporting requirements to third parties to facilitate compliance.\nArticles 1(4)(a) changes the annual deadline for submitting the annual CBAM declaration.\nArticle 1(4)(c) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to claim a carbon price paid in a third country other than the country of origin.\nArticles 1(4), point (d), and 1(6) amend the rules on emission verification so that the obligation to verify embedded emissions only applies to actual values.\nArticle 1(5) amends the calculation of embedded emissions in the case of relevant input materials (precursors).\nArticle 1(7) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to use default carbon prices calculated and made available by the Commission and claim carbon prices paid in third countries other than the country of origin of the goods.\nArticle 1(8) facilitates reporting obligations by introducing several changes to the portal established pursuant to Article 10 to register operators and installations in third countries.\nEN\nEN",

The information collected and the exchanges with the stakeholders, including as part of the expert group on the CBAM, have outlined possibilities for simplifications and improvement of the CBAM. The Union is committed to ensure a smooth roll-out of the CBAM during the post- transitional period starting on | January 2026. (2) Based on the experience acquired and data collected during the transitional period, the distribution of importers of CBAM goods into the Union shows that only a small proportion of importers accounts for the vast majority of embedded emissions in those goods. The derogation applied to the importation of goods of negligible value referred to in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 (consignments of a value below EUR 150) appears insufficient to ensure that the CBAM applies to importers in proportion to their impact on emissions covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For those importers of small quantities of goods, compliance with CBAM reporting and financial obligations could be unduly burdensome.

Therefore, a new derogation should be introduced to exempt importers of small quantities in terms of mass of CBAM goods from CBAM obligations, while preserving the environmental objective of that mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective. (3) A new threshold based on cumulative mass per importer per year should be introduced in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, ensuring that more than 99% of emissions are maintained in scope. This is a robust and targeted approach as it accurately reflects the environmental nature of the CBAM by taking into account all imported emissions over a period of time in determining the threshold. It also eliminates the risk of circumvention through the artificial splitting of consignments by a single importer. (4) A mass-based threshold reflecting the average emissions intensity of the volume of imported CBAM goods would better translate the climate objective of the CBAM. A single mass-based threshold applying cumulatively to all CBAM goods in the iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement sectors imported by importers during a calendar year is the simplest design for importers, as they will not have to obtain or provide any data additional to those provided in the customs declaration, thereby reducing substantially any CBAM-related administrative burden for these importers. A threshold set at a level of 50 tonnes will exempt the vast majority of importers from obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM. To establish the threshold, a new Annex VII should be introduced. (5) The main principles governing the threshold, including ensuring that nearly all embedded emissions remain in the scope of the CBAM, should be laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to provide legal certainty. Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should also provide for the possibility to re-calculate the threshold on the basis of updated average emission intensities of imported goods or significant changes in trade patterns or practices of circumvention affecting the coverage of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM. (6) To ensure that the derogation is sufficiently targeted, it should apply to the importer. The indirect customs representative, due to the nature of its activity and the related obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, should always be required to obtain an authorisation. (7) The competent authorities and the Commission should — based on customs information — monitor the quantities of goods imported to assess compliance with the threshold. To allow the competent authorities to make an informed decision, the customs authorities and the Commission should make the necessary information and data available to the competent authorities. Where the competent authority concludes that an importer has exceeded the threshold, it should communicate that information to the customs authorities who, in turn, should not allow further importation of goods from that importer until the end of the calendar year, or until that importer has obtained the status of authorised CBAM declarant.\n15 Proposal for COUNCIL REGULATION amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 regards the a as introduction of a simplified tariff treatment for the distance sales of goods and Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 as regards the elimination of the customs duty relief threshold (COM(2023) 259 final.\nEN\nEN",

  "page_13": "(14) Where input materials (precursors) have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS, the embedded emissions of those precursors should not be accounted for in the calculation of the embedded emissions of complex goods. (15) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values or actual values verified by accredited verifiers. Default values will be calculated and made available by the Commission. Therefore, the verification of embedded emissions should only apply to actual values. (16) Information collected during the transitional period illustrates difficulties for reporting declarants to obtain the required information on the carbon price effectively paid in a third country. To facilitate the deduction of the carbon price, the Commission should, where possible, establish an annual average carbon price expressed in EUR/tCOze of the effective carbon price paid, based on the best available data from reliable, publicly available information and information provided by third countries, including on a conservative basis. (17) Authorised CBAM declarants may claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions. Since the carbon price may be paid in a third country other than the country of origin of the imported goods, such carbon price should also be eligible for deduction. (18) To improve the reliability of the emissions data contained in the CBAM registry and to facilitate the submission of data, accredited verifiers should be allowed to access the CBAM registry to verify the embedded emissions upon request from an operator in third countries. In addition, parent companies or related undertakings of those operators should be allowed to access the CBAM registry for the purpose of registering and sharing relevant data on behalf of the controlled operator. The operators should be required to provide a corporate or activity registration number to ensure their identification. (19) To foster the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 at national level, Member States should ensure that the competent authorities have the necessary powers to perform their duties. (20) To provide authorised CBAM declarants sufficient time to prepare for compliance with the amended obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Member States should start selling CBAM certificates in 2027 for emissions embedded in goods imported during the year 2026. The price of CBAM certificates, purchased in 2027 and corresponding to emissions embedded in goods imported into the EU in 2026, should reflect the prices of EU ETS allowances in 2026. (21) The obligation for the authorised CBAM declarants to ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year, is insufficiently tailored to the expected financial adjustment. It is therefore necessary to both reduce the ratio from 80 % to 50 % and integrate the free allocation of EU ETS allowances. Furthermore, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to rely on the information submitted in the CBAM declaration in the previous year, for the same goods and third countries.\nEN\nEN",
  "page_14": "(22) The repurchase limit should likewise align more accurately with the number of CBAM certificates which the authorised CBAM declarants are required to purchase during the year of imports. (23) Since CBAM certificates are cancelled without any compensation, there is no need for an exchange of information from the common central platform to the CBAM registry at the end of the working day. (24) The competent authorities, when applying penalties, should be able to take into account the specific circumstances such as the intentional or negligent behaviour of the declarant. That would allow for a reduction of the amount of the penalty where minor or unintentional errors are made. (25) The CBAM applies to certain carbon-intensive goods imported into the Union. The list of CBAM goods in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 includes ‘[o]ther kaolinic clays’ in the list of cement goods. While calcined kaolinic clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non-calcined kaolinic clays. Non-calcined kaolinic clays should therefore be excluded from the scope of the CBAM. (26) Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lists the goods for which only direct emissions should be taken into account in the calculation of embedded emissions. For goods not listed in that Annex, both direct and indirect emissions should be taken into account. Since indirect emissions are not relevant in the case of electricity generation, electricity should be added to the list of goods in that Annex. (27) It is also necessary to simplify the means for determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country would not be available for a certain type of goods. In such cases, to prevent carbon leakage, the default value should be set at the level of the average emission intensity of the ten exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data is available, which is an appropriate average to ensure the environmental objective of the CBAM.

Expected result(s) and impact\nEN\nPolicy area(s) concerned\nClimate policy\nObjective(s)\nIn light of the EU’s increased climate ambitions, the introduction of a CBAM has the\noverarching objective of addressing climate change by reducing GHG emissions in\nthe EU and globally.\nThe amending proposal aims at simplifying the compliance burden on importers of\nCBAM goods.\nThe overarching objective of addressing climate change is further articulated in a number of specific objectives, namely: (i) Addressing the risk of carbon leakage under increased EU ambition. (ii) Contributing to the provision of a stable and secure policy framework for investments in low or zero carbon technologies. (111) Ensuring that domestic production and imports are subject to similar level of carbon pricing. (iv) Encouraging producers in third countries who export to the EU to adopt low carbon technologies. (v) Ensuring that the measure is effective, minimising the risk of being circumvented, thus providing environmental integrity. (vi) Ensuring a proportionate administrative burden for businesses and public authorities in the application of the measure.\nThe amending proposal aims at: (i) reducing administrative burden; (ii) improving the functioning of CBAM.\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThe introduction of a CBAM envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions both in the EU-27 and in the rest of the world in the sectors covered by CBAM. The CBAM is also expected to reduce the risks of carbon leakage, therefore gradually replacing the free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS.\nAs regards economic impacts, the modelling conducted before the adoption of the CBAM Regulation indicated that the introduction of a CBAM and other measures needed to reach the EU’s increased climate ambitions could lead to a GDP contraction for the EU 27 by 0.22 % to 0.23 % in 2030. Impact on the investment side is modest. On the consumption side CBAM appears to have a slightly stronger negative effect relative to the scenario of increased climate ambition and no CBAM.\nBy effectively reducing carbon leakage, the introduction of a CBAM leads to a reduction in imports in the EU 27. Overall, the social impacts of CBAM are limited.\nAdministrative impacts on the Commission, businesses national authorities, are expected. Altogether, compliance costs for businesses and authorities, while\n1.3.2. Specific objective(s)\nEN\n22",

While revenue generation is not an objective of CBAM is expected to generate additional revenue, which for 2030 is estimated at above EUR [2.1 billion to be updated].\nThe amending proposal expects to:\n(1) reduce the number of entities subject to CBAM obligations while preserving the environmental integrity of the mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective;\n(11) enhance the functioning of the mechanism by simplifying and streamlining processes and procedures. The proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which relate to complex calculations or rely on hazardous data collection processes which hamper effective CBAM implementation.\nIn addition, the proposal will also strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is maximised. It will also enable both the Commission to better detect risks and national authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed.\n1.3.4.

A simplified system of the CBAM scheme is currently in place until the end of 2025. Specifically, a transitional period (dry-run for data collection) currently applies to facilitate the smooth roll out of the CBAM and allow traders and importers to adjust.\nCommission services are in charge of implementing and enforcing CBAM both during the transition period (2023-2025) and will also be during the definitive phase (from 2026).\n18\nAs referred in Article 58(2), point (a) (b) of the Financial Regulation.\nto\nor\nEN\n23\nEN",
  "page_33": "During the transition period this implies collecting information from importers of CBAM goods in the EU on the embedded GHG emissions of these goods and analysing data.\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) calls for a progressive introduction of the different functions necessary for its effective implementation. Firstly, a number of reports and reviews need to be prepared in order to facilitate the financial obligation to be set in place. Recognizing this, the CBAM regulation foresees its implementation in two consecutive periods: the Transitional Period from October 2023 until end of 2025 and the Definitive Period as from early 2026.\nDuring the Transitional Period the obligation placed on importers and the EU Authorities (customs) is limited to the filing of the quarterly CBAM reports in addition of the Import declarations.\nDuring the transitional period, transitional information management system (CBAM Transitional Period - CBAM TP) were put in place to support the submission and collection of quarterly reports, as well as the assimilation of data from each report into an aggregated database, to allow for their effective analysis for the purposes of reporting in line with the provisions of the Regulation.\nAdditionally, during the transitional period, customs authorities are tasked with informing customs declarants of the obligation to report information, so as to contribute to the gathering of information as well as to the awareness on the need to request the status of authorised declarant when applicable (before the first importation of CBAM goods from 1 January 2026).\nThe Definitive Period is planned to start on the 01.01.26 for the core CBAM declaration and certificates management services as listed here and one year earlier for authorised declarants registration and processing of CBAM authorisations by the competent authorities:\n- importers are only entitled to import these goods after they have been granted an authorisation (except in case of the derogation proposed in the amending Regulation) by competent authorities, or if they would appoint a representative authorised as CBAM declarant. Customs authorities should not allow the importation of CBAM goods without a authorised CBAM declarant being involved. Furthermore, the customs authorities may carry out checks on the goods, including with respect to the identification of the authorised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the country of origin of the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks relating to CBAM in the design of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013\n- The CBAM should be based on a declarative system where an authorised CBAM declarant, who may act on its own behalf or represent one or more importers, submits annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported to the customs territory of the Union and surrenders a number of CBAM certificates corresponding to those declared emissions.\n- An authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid for those emissions in other jurisdictions. The amending Regulation proposes to introduce a default carbon price which would allow\nEN\n24\nEN",

The Commission should manage the CBAM registry containing data on the authorised CBAM declarants, operators and installations in third countries. The amending Regulation proposes to allow accredited verifiers to access the registry to improve the reliability of emission data shared by operators with declarants through the registry.\n- To reduce the risk of carbon leakage the Commission should take action to address practices of circumvention\n- For the sale and re-purchase of CBAM certificates a common central platform should be established. For the purpose of oversight of the transactions on the common central platform, the Commission should facilitate the exchanges of information and the cooperation between competent authorities, and between those authorities and the Commission. Additionaly, a swift flow of information between the common central platform and the CBAM registry should be establised.\n- The Commission should carry out risk-based controls and should review the content of the CBAM declarations accordingly. For enforcement purposes, Member States may also carry out reviews of individual CBAM declarations. The conclusions of the reviews of individual CBAM declarations should be shared with the Commission and should be made available to other competent authorities in the CBAM registry.\n- Member States should be responsible for the correct establishment and collection of revenues arising from the application of this Regulation.\nTherefore, during the definitive period the number of tasks attributed to the EC increase drastically, requiring an increase in staffing needs. The tasks carried out by this team will include the supervision of authorisation of CBAM declarants made by MS competent authorities, the management of the central database and central registry, coordination and information exchange with MS competent authorities, review of declarations and oversight of the external platform and lastly, tasks requiring legal competencies such as litigation and recovery and _ financial responsibility oversight. The structure of the team is further defined below.\nDuring the definitive period the Commission will be in charge of the majority of the tasks resulting from the CBAM regulation.\nCBAM IT Budget\nThe CBAM Budget to be engaged/ committed for the period 2023-2027 have been assessed at 101,74 M€.The CBAM IT budget encompasses Analysis & Development services, Deployment services, Operations services, cloud services and/or on premises hardware and software licenses for the Transitional and Definitive CBAM System as detailed below :\n- The CAPEX cost has been estimated based on the actual budget engaged and the budget authorised by EC IT Corporate Governance in the form of approved Vision\nEN\n25\nEN",

Since those requirements were introduced by Union Law, their rationalization is also best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency of reporting. This change corresponds to additional IT cost of 18,95 ME for the period of 2025-2027.

This consists of the price resulting from the EU ETS for the sectors covered by the system. The only meaningful way to ensure equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports is to take action at the level of the Union.\nAny initiative needs to be implemented in a way that provides importers, regardless of country of origin and port of entry or destination within the EU, with uniform conditions and incentives for GHG emission reductions that are equivalent to those of domestic producers. The single effective way to do this is by taking action at the level of the EU.\nThe proposed simplification introduced by the amending Regulation is best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency. This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.\nExpected generated EU added value (ex-post) In parallel to the EU ETS, reduction of GHG emissions and protection against the risk of carbon leakage in the EU single market can be established most adequately at the EU level. Additionally, the need for minimal administrative costs is best achieved by establishing consistent rules for the entire single market, further underlining the added value of an intervention at the EU level.\nThe public consultation has confirmed the added value of taking action on the CBAM at the EU level. In particular, stakeholders agree that an EU CBAM is needed due to existing differences of ambition between the EU and the rest of the world and in order to support the global climate efforts. In addition, in view of the EU’s position in international trade, if it introduces a CBAM the environmental effect on international climate ambitions will be most effective as a potential example to follow.\nThus, the objective of reducing emissions and climate neutrality requires — without equally ambitious global policies — action by the European Union.\n1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n1.5.4.\nThe CBAM is a new mechanism. The preferred option in the Impact Assessment\ndraws from the EU Emissions Trading System and aims at replicating some of its\nfeatures.\nIf sufficient ressources are not made available to enforce CBAM correctly, there is a\nserious risk that businesses will avoid CBAM.\nThe amending proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing CBAM\nsince the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.\nCompatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments\nIn the interinstitutonal agreement of 16 December 2020, signed in the context of the negotiations, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that \"the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the\nEN\n30\nEN",

As part of the mandate received, the Commission was invited to put forward a proposal for a CBAM in the first semester of 2021.\nThe final agreement by co-legislators foresees that most of the implementation and enforcement of CBAM will be the responsibility of the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure the correct deployment of the proposal the appropriate financing means need to be made available within the current MFF.\nThe amending proposal is consistent with the objective of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while reducing administrative the costs (notably for small importers, but also for Member States’ authorities) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means.\n1.5.5.

The 2025 report will also review the scope of the CBAM to examine the possibility of extending it to cover emissions of other EU ETS sectors at risk of carbon leakage, products further down the value chain as well indirect emissions for all sectors. For this, it is necessary to monitor the effect of CBAM on the shortlisted sectors.\nManagement and control system(s)\nJustification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed\nA significantly centralised set-up allows a very uniform and efficient implementation of CBAM across the EU including in Member states with more limited administrative capacity on climate issues. The majority of the implementation and enforcement functions have been attributed to Commission services. These also require an increased number of control functions in order to ensure the correct implementation and management of the CBAM. The Commission has also foreseen an increased number of measures for fraud prevention.\nWhile this simplification package will significantly reduce the administrative burden for importers, notably SMEs, as well as national authorities, this is made possible by Commission services taking up increased responsibilities and more tasks, notably in the monitoring and enforcement.\n2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them\nThe CBAM will be based on a declarative system, which entails the risk of non- declaration or misdeclaration.\nIn order to address the risk of non-declaration, the system requires an authorisation before importing goods in the scope of the Regulation. National Customs Authorities will be in charge of enforcing this rule by not releasing into free circulation these goods as long as the declarant is not authorised according to this Regulation.\nIn order to address the risk of misdeclaration a system of auditing on risk assessment criteria as well as random audits will be in place coupled with sanctions set up as a sufficiently high level to serve as deterrent. Auditing will take place both at the level of CBAM declaration by the national authorities and at the level of import declarations by customs authorities.\n2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)\nCommission services will control the correct application of CBAM, in particular the surrender of CBAM certificates and the correct application of the de minimis\nEN\n34\nEN",

A strong risk management system will be applied to ensure cost-effective controls and tackle risks of circumvention.\nMeasures to prevent fraud and irregularities\nThe financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties.\nEfficient anti-fraud actions require active cooperation, including knowledge-sharing and exchange of information, between customs authorities and competent authorities, both at national level and EU level; it may also require cooperation with third countries. A specific attention should be drawn to non-reliable economic operators (e.g. shell company, missing traders) and cross-border trade inside the EU.\nQuick anti-fraud action should be put in place to react to new/newly detected fraud risks. Authorities in charge should report and share knowledge on fraudulent patterns.\nWhere an authorised CBAM declarant or an importer fails to comply with the obligations in the CBAM regulation, penalties will be applied. The amount of the penalty will be based on penalties in the EU ETS.\nIn case of repeated offences, the national competent authority may decide to suspend the account of the declarant.\nCommission services, together with national competent authorities and national customs, have set up CBAM risk management network, which will work on a joint anti-circumvention strategy.\nEN\n35\nEN",

The CBAM Information system exchanges as well risk management information with the EU Customs systems. The interface with the EU Customs Systems is a vital feed for the operation of CBAM as the whole concept of CBAM is to avoid double capture of information by requesting the CBAM Declarants to complement their imports with a report of the emission incurred during their production in third Countries.

The CBAM Declarants will need to keep their CBAM accounts in an 80% balance on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are in position to surrender the required number of certificates for offsetting their declared emissions and emission prices already paid in third Countries. The Commission will re-purchase the surplus certificates from the CBAM Declarants in name of the Member States. The Commission and the Member States must jointly establish and manage this platform, which is however outside the scope of the CBAM Registry. The interface with the CCP is vital for the CBAM Declarants to provision the necessary certificates in their CBAM accounts. The accounts and the certificates will be highly sensitive information.\nThe ETS system will simply set the selling price of the certificates.\nThe primary users of the CBAM Registry are the CBAM Declarants. DG TAXUD anticipates that they may amount to 200.000 in 2026 (following the adoption of the simplification the number of declarants will be reduced but it will be further extended by the CBAM extension for the downstream goods). They will use the CBAM Registry to declare the emission accrued on the production of their imported goods on a yearly basis (May of each year), to monitor the quarterly balance of their CBAM accounts in term of certificates versus declared imports and to interact with the National Customs Authorities during review of their CBAM declarations. The CBAM Declarants will first be vetted by the National Competent Authorities via the CBAM Registry and then be granted an authorisation to import CBAM goods and be given a CBAM account. The CBAM Declarants will then be able to declare annually their emissions in the CBAM Registry and to surrender the required certificates.\nThe Operators of the Installations producing the CBAM goods in the third countries will register on the CBAM Registry before entering the emission details of their products. The CBAM Declarants will be able to refer to the entries of the Operators to justify their reported emission. It is a significant measure to reduce the compliance burden of the CBAM Declarants and to improve the quality of the CBAM data. While there is no evidence to support an estimate at this stage, DG TAXUD guestimates the number of Operators at 50.000 in 2026.\nThe CBAM National Competent Authorities (NCA) will use the CBAM Registry to grant the access to the CBAM Declarants, to manage the CBAM Authorisations, to monitor the CBAM accounts and declarations and interact with the CBAM Declarants to ensure their compliance with the CBAM regulation. They are the single point of contact to the CBAM Declarants.\nOther Authorities will be granted access to the CBAM Registry to contribute to the risk management and the enforcement from their respective areas of responsibilities. The CBAM Registry will coordinate and support the inter-agencies collaboration in fostering compliance. The National Customs Administrations will validate the CBAM Authorisation during the control of the import declarations using the replication and validation services of the CBAM Registry via the EU CSW-CERTEX.\nThe Commission will assign and maintain the CBAM accounts of the CBAM Declarants up to date in the CBAM Registry, combining the information from the imports received from National Customs Administrations, the emissions from the yearly declarations, the quantity of certificates, their purchase reported by the CCP, their yearly surrendering confirmed by the CBAM Declarant, and the re-purchase of unused certificates.

Interoperability assessment\nCBAM is cross border by design as it supports the CBAM lifecycle across the EU, and in particular the orchestration of the Risk Assessment, review of the CBAM Declarations across all NCA and the Commission.\nCollaboration across National Customs systems will be ensured, by leveraging the Commission’s IT services and interfaces (such as SURV3, EU CSW - CERTEX), as well as new components, specifically designed for CBAM purposes.\nThe CBAM Registry has been designed to support interoperability by emphasizing use on openness, modularity, decoupling and robust interfaces. It will interact with the CBAM national systems, with the Common Central Platform, the EU Customs systems from DG TAXUD and the National Customs Administrations, with the other DG’s systems via open interfaces\nThe CBAM Central Repository will use the existing interfaces of the EU Customs Systems managed by DG TAXUD and will define dedicated formats for the Customs Import and Inward Processing records to be provided by the National Customs Administrations. The new interfaces with the National Customs Systems will be published early 2024 to allow the National Customs Administrations enough lead time to prepare their systems accordingly.\nThe S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CCP will be based on structured messages exchange and be available early 2024 to allow enough lead time for both the CBAM Registry and the CCP to integrate their respective interfaces by mid-2025.\nThe S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CBAM National Systems (to be developed by the MS) will be based on structured message exchanges and also be made available early 2024.\nThe S2S interface with the systems of the other EU Authorities will be specified and developed on a bilateral basis during the elaboration and build of the CBAM Registry.\nAll these interfaces will be structured messages based and will comply as far as possible with the EUCDM and with the UCC Annex B. The A2B and B2B specifications will be referred in a CBAM Implementing Act\nReusability Constraints\nThe reusability is at the very heart of the architecture principles adopted for the CBAM Central Register.

Measures to support digital implementation\nThe CBAM regulation defines the deployment of the CBAM Registry in two periods declined in 3 consecutive phases:\ne Period perspective: a progressive deployment during a Transitional Period from the Q4 2023 until the Q4 2025, followed by a Definitive Period from Q1 2026. o During the Transitional Period, the CBAM importers report the emission of their imported goods quarterly but do not have to purchase and surrender certificates. It is the running in period of the CBAM scheme. During the Definitive Period, starting on 01 January 2026, the CBAM Declarants must be authorised, they declare their emissions once per year, they purchase certificates to keep their CBAM account at minimum 80% balance between their emissions and the purchased certificates, and they surrender their certificates with their yearly declarations. e Phase & Part perspective: o CBAM Phase 1: the “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods (so called Part 1), to be used during the whole Transitional Period as from Q4 2023 (out of scope of the Project Charter); CBAM Phase 2: the “CBAM reports” provided by the importers of CBAM goods (Part 1), the CBAM Declarant Authorisation and the registration of the Operators of third countries Installations (so called Part 2) as from 31 December 2024 in anticipation of the Definitive Period; CBAM Phase 3: The Part 2 augmented with the CBAM declarations and certificates along with the full CBAM account management (so called Part 3) as from the start of the Definitive Period but without Part 1 “CBAM Reports” as from the end of the Transitional Period 31 December 2025.

Refer to the next section for the definition of the external systems and entities.\nCBAM Part 2 Scope: on top of Part 1, The “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods, comes the Part 2 “CBAM Authorisation and Installations” (both in green in the following diagrams), which will enter in operation on 31 December 2024 as mandated by the CBAM regulation. Both Part 1 and Part 2 will then be further maintained and evolved during the remaining of the Transitional Period. The “CBAM Authorisation and Installation” will be integrated in the CBAM Definitive System while the “CBAM reports” will be phased out at the end of the Transitional Period. The Part 1 and Part 2 interface the CBAM Registry with the National Customs Import Systems, with the National Customs Inward Processing Systems and the supporting EU Customs systems of DG TAXUD to foster compliance at minimal burden for trade. CBAM Part 2 comes in anticipation of the Definitive System by delivering its first component.\nThe CBAM Phase 2 Timeline: It starts on the 31 December 2024 and ends on the 31 December 2025 with the start of the Definitive Period.
