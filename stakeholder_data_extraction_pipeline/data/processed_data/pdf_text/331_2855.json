In the cement sector, the expected allocation deficit puts some 40 million tonnes of EU manufactured clinker at risk of being offshored by 2030 (equivalent to >20% of the EU demand). The construction sector’s transition towards carbon-neutrality will significantly contribute to reaching Europe’s ambition to be a carbon neutral continent by 2050. The import of more carbon-intensive products to meet the demand for construction materials in Europe will slow down this transition and hamper low-carbon investments and innovation in European assets.\n1/4",

It is a necessary measure to maintain a fair competition as the free allocations under ETS phase IV will not be sufficient to enable EU-based manufacturing to compete fairly with non-EU imports that do not have equivalent carbon costs. In turn, it will provide the necessary assurance for EU manufacturers to continue investing in low carbon innovation & technology across European assets.\nCBAM design options for the cement sector\ne Compatibility with EU ETS and free allocation: As EU ETS phase IV comes into force, by default free allocations will not to cover the full carbon cost paid by EU manufacturers (e.g. revised benchmarks that are based on the 10th percentile best performers). Unless the CBAM covers immediately 100% of the carbon cost paid by domestic manufacturers (vs. an incremental / phasing-in approach), CBAM should cover the cost beyond the level of free allocations. Deducting free allocations received by EU manufacturers in the calculation of the CBAM will allow to avoid “double protection” for domestic EU manufacturers. If or when the CBAM covers 100% of EU domestic carbon costs, then free allocations would probably need to be phased-out in order to ensure compatibility with WTO/GATT. In such circumstances, the phasing-out of the free-allowances mechanism and the parallel phasing-in of the CBAM must be done over a well-designed transition period that avoids any severe economic shocks that no industrial sector could absorb. The design of the CBAM will also have to ensure that it does not interfere with the EU carbon budgets and remains parallel / complementary to the EU ETS.\n|\n=\n1\nCarbon cost not covered by ETS mechanisms and to be “levied” on imports (CBAM)\n-\n=\nTotal carbon cost for\nEU manufacturers\nEU ETS Benchmark (free\n|\nallocations)\n~\nCarbon-pricing for carbon-neutrality: the transition towards a carbon neutral economy requires carbon prices/costs/constraints/opportunities that are reflected across value chains. Integrating carbon pricing across value chains in the form of carbon consumption charges would form a way forward that would eliminate most trade-related concerns as it would apply to domestic and imported products, based on a harmonized carbon footprint methodology established as a requirement to access the single market. Measuring the CO2 content of imported clinker / cement: CEN EN 19694-3' is the standard used by the cement industry to measure and report its CO2 emissions. It forms a globally harmonised methodology for the calculation CO2 emissions from clinker and cement production. It also provides the basis for the GCCA (Global Cement and Concrete Association) Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing. These guidelines are intended as a tool for cement companies worldwide and\n‘ Stationary emissions determination of GHG emissions in energy-intensive industries Part 3: cement industry source — —\n2/4\n9 HOLCIM",

This standard is used by the industry globally and forms an adequate basis to report the verified emissions of any import. Unpredictability in free allocations and carbon price: The CBAM must fairly take into account the unpredictable future variations in carbon prices and free allocations (e.g. in case a Cross Sectoral Reduction Factor being applied during Phase IV of the EU ETS). It must therefore factor-in the variability and uncertainty of the regulatory regime, and must not be based on fixed EU averages of past performances (which in most case would be an inaccurate reflection of the present circumstances at a given time of import). In practice, the charge (for the cement sector) could look like as follows:\nCarbon import charges (€/t clinker) = (verified emissions2 of import + associated transport emissions in kg CO2/t clinker) - (EU ETS clinker benchmark in kg CO2/t clinker * CSRF) multiplied by the carbon price (€/kg CO2)\nCarbon content of\n950\nimported clinker (kg CO2/t\n|\nclinker)2\nmEU ETS Benchmark (kg\nCO2/t CK) multiplied by\nCSRF\n= Carbon content to subject\nto CAM (kg CO2/t clinker)\n0\n200 400\nContent (kg\nFigure 1: hypothetical calculation of carbon content of imported clinker submitted to CBAM\nCarbon\nCO2/t Clinker)\ne Carbon price: The carbon price used to calculate the charges must be as close as possible to actual spot prices, given the significant volatility that currently exists on the carbon market and uncertainties linked to a large list of factors (coal plant closures, economic perspectives, etc.). If the use of spot prices may be complex, periodical averages should be used and include a precise review mechanism that can ensure that transactions are not entirely disconnected from the situation (and operational reality of domestic producers) at the time of import.\nOverarching Principles\nA CBAM should first be introduced in a pilot phase in parallel with EU ETS mechanisms. A gradual phase-out of ETS free allocation cannot be envisaged unless the CBAM is fully tested, operational and legally secured (incl. WTO compatibility). Sectors that compete significantly in downstream markets must be included in the same regime, in order to avoid distortions of competition. The system for importers should be based on verified emissions (from the producing facility, according to international standards, and by independent third party verifiers). The system must fairly account for the uncertainty relating to carbon prices and free allocation evolutions.\n3/4\nAbout Holcim\n9 HOLCIM",
