For example, regional experts are constantly following legislative developments related to CO2 and meeting in a quarterly basis to share their progress, analyzing potential impacts for CEMEX, and immediately reporting any material changes (such as new emission taxes or important adjustments to emissions trading systems) to the ERM network and Corporate Sustainability.\nThe identification and assessing of the climate-related risks and opportunities scope compress the full value chain, mainly the direct operations but also upstream, where supplies are monitored to evaluate any potential risk of lack or price increase and downstream, where the logistics and market is monitored to identify and evaluate any potential risk in the market (customer behaviour changes to adapt the portfolio, logistics to deliver our products...). Identification and assessing of the climate-related risks and opportunities are analysed in a short, medium and long term time horizon.\nAn example of how the described process is applied to a transitional risk: the most important transitional risk identified is the transition to a new or update of the carbon regulation.1) Situation: Sustainability and ERM monitor the status of each country in regards to carbon regulation, having different situations: some countries are already regulated and the regulation will evolve in the short-term (i.e. EU and California), in some other countries there is a short-term plan to implement a new carbon regulation (i.e. Mexico) and there are some countries with no short-term risk, but a med or long-term is consider. 2) Task: first the financial impact of the transitional risk is evaluated in terms of CO2 and cost, and the goal is to minimize this impact. 3) Action: the action taken has been the development of the cement site-by-site plan \"CEMEX CO2 Roadmap\", to identifying and listing all the carbon reduction initiatives specific for each site regardless of a carbon regulation in place. The plan has to be tracked and the resources ensure for full implementation. 4) Result: the result of the action is that, after the implementation of all the identified initiatives, the financial impact can be significantly reduced to close to -20%.\nAn example of how the described process is applied to a physical risk: an example of a physical risk identified is the increase of extreme storm events that can disrupt supply of crucial inputs. 1) Situation: Increased frequency and strength of tropical cyclones (as well as other extreme storms) can cause disruption of the supply of our operations. ERM selects those operations with higher probability of a extreme event to happen, based in mainly historical events derived from climate change patterns (within the scope for example SCAC (South Central America & Caribbean) - Dominican Republic, Colombia and Puerto Rico). 2) Task: first the financial impact of the transitional risk is evaluated and the goal is to minimize this impact. 3) Action: to manage this risk ERM takes a structured and homogeneous approach worldwide by implementing a so called \"Business Continuity Program\" (BCP) to minimize the potential impact of a disruptive event in our businesses.

This program is conducted by FM Global, CEMEX’s global property insurer, with the collaboration of site experts, mainly operations, procurement, and planning. The assessment provides each plant with a grade score by which all plants can be assessed.\nThe process to carry out the annual assessment is as follows:\n- All cement sites are assessed annually, additionally with certain frequency some other strategic locations with a significant insurable value are visited like officers, marine terminals, warehouses, etc.\n- The probability of occurrence and the financial impact if the identified risks are materialized, are evaluated in each site\n- To evaluate the probability of occurrence of these climate related events (natural hazards), FM Global gets support from several proprietary maps of windstorm, flooding, seismic, wildfires..., built on information from the NASA, Research Centers, Universities, and other governmental local sources mainly in the USA.\nThe financial impact is classified in two different terms: “Loss Expectancies-Property Damage”, the “Loss Expectancies-Time Element”. The “Loss Expectancies-Property Damage” evaluate the cost of the physical damage to equipment or infrastructure and the \"Loss Expectancies- Time Element” evaluates the production loss and the cost derived from the activities to restore the original production. Depending on the type of event, a recovery time and collateral damage is evaluated with the following formula:\n-\nLE-TE = (BI * (T/12 months) * % Exposure\nLE-TE: Loss-Expectancy Time-Element\n-\n- Bl: Annual reported Incomes\n- T: Estimated stoppage time\n- % Exposure: percentage of participation of the specific equipment/building over the total site’s production.\n- FM Global also considers proprietary data on historical losses (average recovery time) and research and experience on reconstruction of buildings and/or equipment replacement.\n- Additionally, FM Global sets a series of recommendations to mitigate the financial impact together with their “remediation cost” to eliminate/mitigate the risk of a physical damage caused by an acute or chronic climate-related event.\nAll recommendations from the PLPP are prioritized and evaluated for decision making using three criteria: 1. Financial loss expectancy should the risk occur, 2. Risk improvement ratios defined as the ratio of loss expectancy to the cost to complete the recommendation to mitigate or avoid the risk exposure, and 3. Specific catastrophe risks.\nAfter recommendation’s completion, the loss expectancy-property damage and loss expectancy-time element can be reduced or eliminated, so the recommendation completion is followed-up in a yearly basis and re-evaluated when accomplished.\nAn example of how the described process is applied to a physical risk with a STAR approach:\n24",

Given the significant implications that even\nsmall changes to e.g. free allocation to our operations or overall scarcity of allowances can have it is paramount for CEMEX\nto follow closely current developments and adjust our risk adjustment and strategy accordingly.\nEXAMPLE of Risk Type: Carbon tax on just liquid and gas (coal and petcoke are excluded) fossil fuels in Colombia, already\naffecting our operational cost, mainly related to transport. The same happens with the current regulation in Mexico, where\nall fossil fuels, excluding Natural Gas, are taxed, so this taxation is directly affecting our operational cost.\nCEMExX fully supports the implementation of the Paris Agreement and collaborates with governments around the world to\ndefine and implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In a quarterly basis, the CEMEX \"CO2 Regulation\nFocus Group\", comprised of PA, Operations and Sustainability members in each Region, share the insights from this\ncollaboration with governments and identify any risk in emerging regulations.

It is therefore crucial that the energy efficiency of buildings be improved, and the most likely way to achieve this is via more stringent energy efficiency standards for buildings. This will open several opportunities for CEMEX: - Significantly lowering total energy consumption of buildings and helping to design the \"sustainable cities of the future\", will most likely require an increased replacement or refurbishment of existing buildings, which means more construction activity. - It is widely recognized that concrete’s thermal properties make it an excellent structural material for energy-efficient buildings in both cold and hot climates, implying that under more stringent efficiency standards the consumption of concrete per unit is likely to increase. - More stringent building codes are likely to foster the development of new materials and constructive solutions; this will give innovative companies like CEMEX a competitive edge and will allow for higher margins on these already existing and new higher performance products being developed. A very specific example was showcased on the British TV program Grand Designs; it is the Corrigall “Concrete House”, which exemplifies the spirit of collaboration between our R&D, customers, architects, and engineers that CEMEX is always pursuing. The objective was to minimize, if not eliminate, conventional steel reinforcement while achieving very high thermal efficiency. Using CEMEX Resilia ultra-high strength and\nCEMEX hyper ductile fiber-reinforced concrete, the outcome was the first building in the UK where steel reinforcement was reduced by 75%,\nembodying a 39% reduction of CO2 in the concrete structure or the equivalent of 120 tCO2.

On the other hand, the savings in our variable cost due to the consumption of these collected alternative fuels in our kilns in Mexico was close to 2,004,000 USD in 2021.\nThe cost to realize the opportunity in the medium-term worldwide is the cost of the lobbying actions to promote the implementation of the appropriate waste management policies and to promote the unique benefits of co-processing. Quantitative breakdown of the cost to realize the opportunity = estimated cost of the lobbying actions equivalent to 200 annual lobbying hours * 60 USD/hour * 50 lobbying resources around the world = 600,000 USD/year * 10 years = 6,000,000 USD for 10 years.\nThe cost to realize the opportunity in the medium-term worldwide is the cost of the lobbying actions to promote the implementation of the appropriate waste management policies and to promote the unique benefits of co-processing.

The Board is ultimately responsible for supervising the overall operation of our company and is composed of qualified persons who provide appropriate oversight. In performing its functions, our Board of Directors is aided by three committees with specialized areas of expertise. Since 2014, Cemex has had a sustainability committee (the Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact, and Diversity Committee or the “Committee”), which is responsible for, among other things, overseeing sustainability strategies, goals and programs, evaluating the effectiveness of sustainability and climate action goals and initiatives; identifying the main risks concerning sustainability-related matters and overseeing mitigating actions; and providing assistance to the Chief Executive Officer and senior management team regarding the strategic direction on sustainability and social responsibilities model. The Committee’s members are appointed by our shareholders in our general shareholders’ meeting. Currently, 75% of the Committee’s members are considered to be independent directors under the Mexican Securities Market Law (Ley del Mercado de Valores). The Committee directly supports Cemex’s Board of Directors and is supported by our Global Sustainability Vice president, which currently reports directly to Cemex’s Chief Executive Officer. Cemex’s Global Sustainability Vice president provides directs briefings on relevant sustainability matters to the Committee approximately four times per year, and to the Board of Directors once per year. Cemex’s climate transition plan has been widely discussed at Cemex’s Committee and has been presented to and approved by Cemex’s Board of Directors.

The worst-case temperature scenario is the STEPS-RC 4.5, which does not take it for granted that governments will reach all announced goals. Instead, it takes a granular sector-by-sector look, considering not only existing policies but also of those that are under development, like the “Fit for 55” package. The SDS and NZE are also considered to evaluate the resiliency of our strategy as more restrictive transitional scenarios and less impacting in terms of physical risks evaluation (RCP 2.6 - RCP 1.9).\nTo assess our strategy effectiveness the following risks were evaluated under the different selected scenarios:\nReduced market demand for higher-carbon products / Increased operating costs for high carbon activities under regulated markets / Risk of stranded assets, where for all risks both probability and impact increase in the NZE.\nAnd physical risk, so increased business interruption and damage across operations and supply chains, where the probability and impact increase in the STEPs — RCP 4.5.\nAnd the following opportunities:\nIncreased demand for lower-carbon products and services / New technologies available at competitive cost / Access to competitive energy sources, where probability and impact increase in the NZE scenario and opportunity to enhance reputation and brand value, where in all probability and impact are both similar under the different scenarios.\nThe results of the analysis confirm that CEMEX’s carbon strategy is in general robust under the three analysed scenarios. With the Future in Action program, we remain committed to becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050 and to provide greener products and services for a more sustainable and circular world.\nActions derived from the scenario analysis and how it impacts our strategy:\n- One of the decisions we made based on the scenario analysis was to update in 2022 our 2030 targets to the 1.5°C scenario; out new 2030 targets are now to reduce our net specific CO2 emissions by 47% compared to our 1990 baseline in cement and 41% in concrete. - Also, we decided to validate in 2022 our 2050 climate targets to be in line with the NZ SBTIi.\n- Also, CEMEX will continue investing in research and development to deliver innovative building materials and solutions to build climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings, and climate-resilient infrastructures, while capitalizing on CX Ventures, Urbanization Solutions, and strategic partnership.\n- We remain committed to identifying and investing in new technologies needed to achieve our 2050 target, and it will be strengthened in the most carbon-constrained scenarios.",

According to different studies, like the IEA-CSI Technology Roadmap 2018 and IEA Net-Zero by 2050, one of the major contributors to our emissions reduction to achieve carbon neutrality will be the capture and storage or utilization of CO2 emitted from our processes.\nThe role and relevance of our R&D department based in Switzerland is now essential, as well as the participation of CEMEX Ventures in the research of low-carbon solutions offered by companies and start-ups, like the agreement that we signed in Sept 2020 with Carbon Clean, a global leader in low-cost CO2 amine-based capture technology.\nCEMExX launched in late 2019 a focus group “CO2 Task Force” involving Operations, R&D, Sustainability, CEMEX Ventures, Logistics, Energy and regional representatives to streamline the analysis and participation in the different research. As a result, CEMEX is now participating in more than 30 innovation projects and aims to build a demonstration pilot in 5 of our facilities.\nCase study\nSituation: The major contributor to achieve our 2050 neutrality ambition is carbon capture, so CEMEX\nneeded to get involved in capture research by partnering and consortiums’ participation. Task: The goal is to get a portfolio of cost-effective and scalable capture technologies, so we need to explore and get involved in the different alternatives.\nAction: CEMEX stablished is determined to be\nand started conversations with\ntotally disruptive Synhelion. The radically new approach is based on replacing the use of fossil fuels in cement plants with high-temperature solar heat, and capturing 100 percent of the carbon emissions, which are then utilized as feedstock for fuel production, enabling cement manufacturing to achieve net-zero level. This is made possible by the unprecedented temperature levels of solar heat provided by Synhelion’s technology and its pioneering process to turn CO2 into synthetic drop-in fuels, such as kerosene, diesel, and gasoline. Result: CEMEX announced their collaboration in September 2020, and in early 2022, CEMEX and Synhelion announced the successful production of the world’s first solar clinker.\ncement plants.\nCEMEX developed a very detailed low carbon transition plan for a short and medium-term time horizon and enhanced it in 2021 to align it with the new SBTi Scope 1 target verified in 2021.

Situation: CEMEX has a low carbon transition plan in place (CO2 Roadmap) that is being followed-up in a monthly basis. Task: CEMEX CEO wants to ensure that its low carbon transition plan is accomplished in a timely manner in all the sites at the scheduled pace. Action: In 2021 CEMEX designed and tested a methodology to impact the CVA results of the cement plants depending on their individual performance, the “CEMEX ETS’, that together to the link to remuneration will strengthen the accomplishment of the planned activities. Result: In 2021, we have started to monitor in a monthly basis the YTD performance vs.YTD goal for 100% of our cement sites.

Magnitude: medium. The magnitude of the impact on sale has been so far around a 0.5%, that is still very low, but we expect a medium impact in the middle term and a medium-high impact in the long term, impacting 100% of our business units. The operating cost (direct and indirect) is already being impacted by changes in regulations that increase operating production cost mainly in EU cement operations and California. We include this operating cost increase effect within the OCF (Operating Cash Flow) forecast in the short term (5 Year Business Plan) and moreover, considering the OCF impact in the middle term by simulating the already known rules of the Phase IV (in EU and California) and also the mitigation actions we are carrying out to reduce the impact (CO2 Roadmap). Another impact in the financial planning is the Alternative Fuels strategy when the price lowers or is expected to lower. We find new Alternative Fuels opportunities in very specific areas (UK) with a 5% of cost decrease compared to previous contracts. The impact of this lever is still low, and it is just affecting to some EU operations (mainly UK and Poland), but we are including the potential effect in the middle term financial planning process (5 Year Business Plan, that is updated annually the minimum, and every time a relevant change arise)\nCapital allocation and expenditures have an important role for all identified risks and all identified opportunities, so it is factored within our financial planning process with a high impact (magnitude). While climate change-related risks and opportunities are relevant for all kinds of capital, the main areas where they factor into the CEMEX planning process are the following:\n- Financial capital: systematic consideration of costs induced by GHG regulation (e.g. taxes, cost for purchase of allowances) in the evaluation of investment projects; general stress testing of our mid-term financial planning by applying an internal carbon price USD 30 per metric tonne of CO2 (average price, for details refer to C11 Carbon pricing) and a sensitivity analysis with different prices to evaluate the robustness of the investment. - Human Capital: Increasingly stronger focus on climate change-related topics, e.g. R&D into low-carbon technologies and products; further development of climate management and related processes; investigation of the life-cycle impact of our products and services; transparent communication around the company's carbon strategy, performance, and\nadvantages of our products and services\n59",

The results will certainly depend on the size of the transaction but may range from low impact to being a substantial part of the overall value; as a systematic approach, the climate related risk is always considered in our acquisition and divestment planning process and factored within a high impact (magnitude). For instance, we announced the temporary closing of two operations in Spain in 2018 and one in UK in 2020, and one of the drivers to take this decision was the higher specific emissions of these operations (we cannot disclose more detailed information), so the production cost increase expected there in the long term (risk evaluation). Example of the impact is that our climate change/low carbon investment increased by more than 25%, and it is planned to increase much more in the coming years, as we planned in our \"CO2 Roadmap\". The access to capital is an opportunity that is already impacting our operations with a medium impact (magnitude), and we are foreseen a potential to become a high impact risk.

Finally, we will work with our clinker/cement suppliers to reduce the intensity of the supplied goods, ensuring that we choose the most efficient source for these supplies. Currently we are using the average-data method to calculate the emissions, and the emission factors are obtained from Getting the Numbers Right database from Global Cement and Concrete Association. These are weighted average emission factors depending on the country of origin and have a couple of years in delay from the most current data. We will push to obtain reliable emissions data directly from suppliers so that their intensity emissions become part of purchases decision making. We currently have an increase of 5.5% in this target but as we push our suppliers to have reliable emissions data available, we are sure we will be able to achieve our target firstly by reducing clinker purchased to third parties and by working with our suppliers to reduce their own emissions.",

Likewise, we were including the transportation emissions\nfrom our own fleet on Scope 3, we are now including those emissions on Scope 1, so the Well-to-Tank emissions\nfrom the fuels purchased for our own fleet are now also included on category 3: fuel and energy related. We are\nalso including additional emissions in our inventory as these updates in our inventory were required for our\nsubmission of our science-based targets with SBTi.

In any case, we performed the emissions screening assuming that all our cement is processed to be transformed to Ready-Mix.

Therefore, companies do not have to report these categories. Thus, to perform the emissions screening under this category we focus in Ready-Mix; we assume that ALL sold concrete is demolished at the end of its lifetime and then processed to be recycled (30% recycling rate, higher than the actual one to be conservative), using Ecoinvent Global Emission Factors v.3.7.1. for electricity for crushing and material loading&movement and sorting.

There is a designated leader in each Region from Operations and another leader from the Strategic planning side. This effort is leaded globally by the Director of Sustainability in coordination with the VP of Operations and Technology. There is a dedicated resource to consolidate all the information at global level.\nThis plan aims to identify, evaluate from the technical point of view and evaluate the economical feasibility of each and every initiative listed in each site. According this economical feasibility, the initiatives are classified in short, middle and long term execution. The roll-out in each country started with a kick-off workshop, leaded by Global Ops and Tech (GO&T) and Corporate Sustainability, where the goal is presented together with the available global solutions. The Workshop is comprised of local members from Operations (production, quality and maintenance), Sustainability, Procurement, Sales and Planning.\nWe identified 290 initiatives including improvements to energy efficiency, switch to alternative fuels (biomass) or natural gas, the use of clinker substitutes and decarbonated raw materials (local availability) and novel clinker development. CEMEX global is also actively participating in the development of CCUS tech. as a potential long-term solution, together with open constant dialogue with policy makers.\nCARBON ALLOWANCES: The strategy in Europe and California is to keep sufficient number of allowances in our balance to facilitate the transition to a lower clinker emissions, minimizing the financial impact while we execute the investments to reduce our emissions.\nOFFSETS PROJECTS: In addition to the optimization of emissions in regulated installations, CEMEX seeks registration of emission reduction projects that go beyond business as usual and achieve CO2 mitigation at reasonable costs. A particularly good example is the offsetting of all CO2 emissions from our truck fleet in Colombia by investing into eligible reforestation measures in that country. In 2020 we also started to compensate a range of low carbon concrete Vertua with reforestation offsets with our partner NCP (Natural Capital Partners) for Europe and CO2Cero in Colombia.\nMONITORING: In addition to the mandatory monitoring, reporting, and verification required by the EU ETS and CAL ETS, all cement plants track their CO2 emissions using the CSI protocol (see also Q12). All monitoring activities are subject to internal control and third-party verification in a yearly basis. SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS: There is a specific department in charge of energy supplies at corporate level, and also a responsible at Regional Level to ensure all contracts and self generation are including low-carbon generation as part of the decision making process when investing or contracting power supply.\n296",

The calculation follows the criteria established in the CSI-GCCA CO2 cement protocol, son consider fuel emisisons as well as process emissions coming from the decarbonation of our raw materials. CEMEX connected the report to the operational databases to perform the calculation automatically.\nResult: CEMEX implemented in 2020 a CO2 module in the \"Daily Operations Report\" for 100% of the cement plants. As a result we get all CO2 related KPIs in a daily basis and for both, clinker and cement production.

Identify cost-effective CO2 reduction opportunities in those countries where there is no a compliance carbon price in place, but are exposed to increased risks under a scenario of external carbon pricing. 2. Additionally, it raises the awareness among all organization of CEMEX's potential exposure to external carbon pricing (financial impact of the risk) 3. The internal carbon price applied to our monthly results (EBITDA impact) raise awareness of the importance of the CO2 strategy for the company, and at the same time, facilitates the understanding of the site management team of the potential impact of their daily decisions. 4. Drives a culture of constantly reducing our carbon footprint regardless of the existence of a local regulation. Carbon prices based on external mechanisms (taxes, emissions trading) allow us to better evaluate the profitability of daily decisions, projects and strategies. Example of the impact and implications: Alternative Fuel increase investment in a site in Colombia: the evaluation of the investment w/o considering a CO2 price show a payback of 6 years.

Since 2010, our Supplier Sustainability Program (SSP) has made an extensive commitment to sustainability across our value chain, communicating and promoting responsible practices. As part of this global program, a third-party evaluator performs this assessment based on ISO 26000, covering Social, Environmental, Health & Safety (H&S), Business Ethics, Stakeholder Relationships, and Financial Performance standards. Climate related issues are evaluated as part of this assessment to our suppliers. As part of our Sustainability 2030 Ambitions, our goal is to assess at least 90% of the critical suppliers spend under our company’s global procurement scope. By critical we refer to those business partners who can have significant impact on our three core businesses (cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates). Specifically, this involves those who could affect the continuity of our operations, involve environmental risks, and/or contribute the highest spend. This is the rationale for the coverage. At year end we have evaluated 68% of the total procurement spend.\nImpact of engagement, including measures of success\nAFNOR, the specialized consultancy firm we have partnered for SSP, prepares a consolidated report, including findings and conclusions from the assessment and identified opportunity areas, proposing an action plan to close gaps. This evaluation is periodically updated, and suppliers are expected to continuously improve their score (if the company is equal or above the average of their industry-average provided by AFNOR, it needs to be evaluated every 2 years; otherwise the supplier is invited to be evaluated again the next year). This grade is integrated into the supplier’s scorecard to track and reward those that demonstrate advanced sustainability practices. Every year, we recognize our best- performing suppliers of the Program. Process: identification of critical supplier; invitation to be evaluated; signing up of the supplier into a platform where they answer a questionnaire focused in the 4 main topics that CEMEX address: Social, Environmental, Suppliers and Policies. Answers need to have documentation that proves current progress in the self-assessment. AFNOR review the answers and back-up provided to elaborate report and recommendations. Main impact of the engagement and measurement: suppliers have recognized CEMEX’s sustainability priority areas, understanding their importance. As companies are provided with a recommendation plan to improve, when being evaluated in a next round, the expected result tends to be higher than it was. This is how we evaluate the success of the implementation, by evaluating the suppliers’ interest increase and scoring vs. previous round assessment. After CEMEX implemented this Program some suppliers started looking for some opportunities where they could be more efficient and sustainable. Example: raw material freight supplier in Mexico’s central area with a Diesel truck fleet started testing some routes using CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) trucks to evaluate the energy efficiency, autonomy, climate impact and related costs. He increased its CNG trucks fleet to use them in some of our raw material freight routes. In 2022 Cemex also added nearly 200 lower-carbon trucks, mostly concrete mixer trucks powered by low-emission CNG or renewable NG whose carbon footprint is approximately 25% lower than the diesel trucks. Over half of the vehicles were deployed in Mexico, and the rest between Southern California and Colombia.\n301",

Rationale for the coverage: We opened this opportunity to the SMEs suppliers with which CEMEX had already a close relationship and which already had some experience related to sustainable practices. For 5 months over we help them to understand and implement the Ten Principles and identify their impacts on the SDGs. From this experience we not only had good results, but also learned about the challenges and benefits of SMEs participating in the UNGC. With our learnings, and in partnership with the UNGC, we will continue to implement training and sponsorship opportunities to foster sustainable practices beyond our critical supplier group in other geographies. We believe that involving SMEs in our strategy is key. We must go further and support our value chain, share our experiences and our knowledge to fulfill our purpose of Building a Better Future and contribute to our Future in Action strategy, which includes our net-zero commitment for 2050. For this reason, this year we joined the SME Engagement with the UNGC, ILO and other partners as Patrons to support the UNGC in the creation of a value proposition. This initiative aims to accelerate and scale meaningful SMEs engagement in sustainability, in accordance with their capacities and business realities. Our involvement will contribute to enhance outreach and onboarding, create simple tailored programming to promote the Ten Principles and the SDGs, and develop supply chain impact pilots. We work to enhance business opportunities for responsible SMEs, prepared them for future challenges and support them to better adapt to the inevitable net-zero transition. For us, SMEs are the essence of any economy, both in developing and developed economies, and are critical to the fulfillment of the Global Goals.\nImpact of engagement, including measures of success\nOriginally we had budgeted for 50 sponsorships to UNGC membership, however due to the success and demand of our initiative with our SMEs suppliers we ended up opening 4 additional spaces, that's the reason why we have 100% in \"% of suppliers by number\". Impact of engagement: Regarding the training we provided to our suppliers, we had and end of course survey where we asked what they thought SDGs meant in their companies where none responded \"SDGs are not important and a waste of time, there's nothing an SME can do\", and where all answered they were satisfied to be invited to join the UNGC thanks to CEMEX's sponsorship. Our measure of success is how many of the 54 SMEs continue with their UNGC membership in the following year after the conclusion of this initiative. So far, we consider this engagement as successful, as all the invited SMEs are still supporting UNGC, however it is still too early to assess the impact of our suppliers joining the UNGC as this",

Based on the feedback we obtained from our customers through the different communication mechanisms we use to engage with them, we identified an additional opportunity to adapt our administrative processes to become more efficient and, more importantly, to eliminate the contribution that paper order confirmations, invoices have in the climate change challenge. With this innovative spirit in mind, digitizing our invoices represented a significant opportunity to serve 100% of our customers better in all geographies and across all our business lines, assuring we are fulfilling their expectations while minimizing environmental impacts. For this reason, we deployed this effort for 100% of our customer base across all our operations. Going paperless has allowed us and our customers to contribute to carbon emissions mitigation through natural resources conservation by avoiding trees cut, elimination of fossil fuel consumption for transportation of the documents, decrease in energy consumption required to create, process, and store paper (copies, filing, etc.), and also avoid the emissions that would be generated from the eventual paper disposal frequently in landfills.\nImpact of engagement, including measures of success\nOur Cemex Go Paperless initiative is a significant measure towards delivering a Superior Customer Experience while meeting our Cemex's climate action efforts. Digitizing our invoices for 100% of our customers across all our geographies and business lines allows us to serve 100% of our customers better, assuring we are fulfilling their expectations while minimizing environmental impacts. We empower our customers to have total control over their documentation. They can independently access and review their transaction history, monitor order statuses, and manage their records, creating a sense of transparency and trust in their partnership with Cemex. This convenience enhances customer experience and streamlines administrative processes, saving valuable time and resources.\nWe consider this engagement effort successful when at least half of our customers no longer need to request their invoices through their sales representatives and can seamlessly access their current and past documents online, 24/7, through the CemexGo platform, our measure of customer adoption. In 2022, about three-quarters of our invoices were paperless globally, so we consider this engagement initiative as successful. Consequently, the demand for paper has substantially declined, and the transition to a paperless system has streamlined our administrative processes and enhanced efficiency.\nThe current success of the CEMEX Go Paperless campaign is a testament to our commitment to sustainability, customer satisfaction, and environmental responsibility. The results have surpassed our expectations, and we are thrilled to witness the positive impact of our efforts on both our business and the environment. As a result, and in addition to paperless invoices, we are expanding our efforts towards a complete paperless delivery process along the value chain. We are adapting more of our internal processes and systems and strengthening climate change education with our customers to help them adopt paperless administrative tracking considering the positive impact deciding to go paperless represents for the environment, their business, and ours.",

In 2022, we included a new set of questions to better understand the positioning of Cemex's Vertua products, our range of lower carbon and other sustainable attributes products. We send the NPS survey to 100% of our customers. Since we added these questions to the NPS survey, all customers can answer the climate- related questions. Customers are randomly selected ensuring representativeness from all segments and all company sizes (large, medium small according to their consumption volumes). The results of this survey allow us to shape our Future in Action Strategy based on their level of interest and understanding of the subject.\nImpact of engagement, including measures of success\nThe response rate of our Net Promoter Score surveys globally vary between 25% and 30%. According to Qualtrics Studies, a response rate above 25% is considered satisfactory. For this reason we consider this engagement initiative successful. This being said, thanks to our customers’ feedback we have been implementing multiple practices since 2018 to increase our customers’ level of engagement and ultimately our customer experience, some of which are designed to support climate-related action and education with customers. One example of the type of actions derived from the feedback we receive from our customers is that in 2022 we implemented in SCA&C a pickup appointment system for cement plants and distribution centers that cut customers’ wait time by 20% in its first year of operation. This is translated into a more effective sale of our products in terms of time and energy savings.

One of the projects that started materializing in 2022 is the Housing Complex Casas Betania in Barcelona, Spain. This residential building aims to have a class A energy label and it is conceived to meet the criteria of the VERDE environmental certification. During the design stage of the project it was already evident that the materiality of it would play a key role in achieving these goals. The entire concrete delivered at Casas Betania has a very low embodied CO2 footprint and is part of CEMEX’s Vertua brand. The concrete in the north wall has a rigid core and regulates the interior temperature in relation to the exterior. It takes advantage of the material’s inherent thermal mass properties to provide comfort to the living spaces inside. Additionally, through a co-creation process, a special thermal-insulating concrete was designed to eliminate thermal bridges at the openings of the north face walls using CEMEX Insularis Technology. The solution is a precast concrete portico whose purpose is to act as a thermal barrier, preventing heat gains and losses at this critical point of the building’s enclosure. This solution, executed through an innovative digital fabrication technique developed in our innovation center in Switzerland, allows the building to cancel 25% of the building’s heat loss which is typically due to thermal bridges in windows and doors.\nWe also acknowledge the significant contribution to CO2 emissions’ reductions that the design optimisation of structures can generate down the value chain during construction. Hence, we are working intensively with key stakeholders and clients to teach them how the smart use of CEMEX’s advanced concrete technologies can reduce material’s consumption and absolute embedded CO2 emissions in buildings. During 2022 we have developed a specific plug-in for engineers working their projects in BIM (Building Information Modeling) that allows them to optimize their structural calculations - reducing material quantities in walls, pillars and slabs- and gives them the opportunity to make better use of the interior spaces by, for example, increasing span between columns and eliminating the need of joints on industrial floors. All these improvements and savings are feasible by virtue of CEMEX’s ultra-strength fiber-reinforced concrete (Resilia), a technology engineered to achieve unprecedent mechanical performance and eliminate up 100% of the conventional steel reinforcement in structures.\nto\nIn 2022 we have also worked closely with external companies and start-ups aiming to foster the cement and concrete revolution with the mission of addressing the evolving pain points across the industry. One of the ongoing alliances CEMEX is currently working on is with Synhelion, a Swiss start- up company working on using concentrated solar energy to turn CO2 and water into syngas. The Synhelion team worked in close collaboration with CEMEX Global R&D to envision a concentrated solar energy system to run the clinkerization process of cement. The breakthrough materialized during 2022 at IMDEA Energy Institute in Méstoles, Madrid, when Synhelion and CEMEX produced the world’s first ever solar clinker. Both companies continue currently working together on an evolved and scaled version of the technology with the goal of using solar energy to produce clinker on a continuous process, replicating industrial scale production.\nAt the same time, we collaborate with universities from all over the world to explore and develop new ways in which we can make use of CO2 from our production processes, turning “bad” carbon into “good” carbon. One of the associations we have started during 2022 is a stimulating relationship with Nortwestern University in USA. They have done substantial research on the impact of energy transfers on the structure, properties, and behaviour of geological materials.
