Lime is commonly thought of as an unseen product that profoundly affects our daily lives. Lime is used for a wide range of processes in various applications and products, all of which are essential to sustaining a thriving economy and our quality of life. Lime is a crucial mineral resource for key European value chains and its occurrence on European territory guarantees access to essential products and services to European citizens. The absorption and neutralisation properties of lime play an important role in environmental protection, treatment of industrial flue gases, drinking water purification and polluted soils and wastewater treatment. Lime in agriculture increases fertiliser efficiency and is an invaluable ingredient in animal feed and hygienisation processes. Lime is also an important mineral resource for many manufacturing industries: it helps produce high strength steel, high performing construction materials for sustainable housing and infrastructure, and provides solutions to civil engineering, notably for the stabilisation of riverbanks and soils.
