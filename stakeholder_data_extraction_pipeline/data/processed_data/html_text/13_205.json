    "text": "AEGIS Europe believes that as long as other regions do not show the same climate ambition as Europe and comparable industries do not pay the same climate costs, EU policymakers need to ensure that high climate ambition is met with improved, reciprocal measures to protect the most exposed against carbon leakage. Thus, the package should include measures to avoid all forms of carbon leakage through the loss of export competitiveness, source shifting and circumvention. This would strengthen the effectiveness of the measure, thus helping EU industries to better contribute to the overarching climate goals. Please consult through the link below, the full Press Release of AEGIS Europe:",
