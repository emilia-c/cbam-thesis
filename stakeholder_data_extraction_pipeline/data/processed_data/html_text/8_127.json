Since then, the business has been transformed and modernised through significant investment. Today in Poland, ArcelorMittal has Europe’s most modern hot rolling mill, in Kraków; the heavy section mill in Dąbrowa Górnicza is in the elite group of mills able to produce 120-metre-long rail. Carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 42 percent, dust emissions by 90 percent, and energy consumption by 40 percent. According to the latest report from the Warsaw School of Economics, in 2023 ArcelorMittal was the second largest foreign investor in Poland. The company’s achievements gain even more importance at a time when many steel companies in the central and eastern Europe region are facing serious challenges concerning their future. Speaking at the 20th anniversary celebrations in Sosnowiec, Poland, Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe said: “As in the rest of Europe today, Polish steelmakers are under intense pressure, due to the high costs of making steel in Europe and the volume of subsidised, cheap imports flooding the market. As a result, the European steel industry will continue to shrink. But with the right policies in place to support us, we can thrive - and our industry can continue to be the foundation of European industry - in a new era.”",
