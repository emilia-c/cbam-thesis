Evaluation of the European Commission’s CBAM Proposal September 9 @ 14:00 - 16:00 According to the roadmap for the European Green Deal, and European Council conclusions from July 2020, a proposal for a BCA for “selected sectors” will be released on July 14, 2021 and should be introduced by the end of 2022. Since the beginning of the CBAM Project, ERCST presented the Sectoral CBAM Report with a deep dive into the specificities of individual sectors as well as issues and options of the general CBAM Design. It was followed by the Proposal and discussed with multiple stakeholders in the EU and internationally. During this meeting the ERCST will present the reaction to the CBAM Proposal based on the earlier studies of CBAM design and redlines. ERCST’s project on border carbon adjustment is supported by BDI, CEFIC, EBRD, Enel, Eurofer, Eurometaux, Fertilizers Europe, FuelsEurope, HeidelbergCement, the Government of France, the Government of Germany, the Government of Spain, Metinvest, Solvay and SITRA.
