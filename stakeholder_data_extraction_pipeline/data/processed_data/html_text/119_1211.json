Policy-makers and businesses must now look ahead to the transition period for CBAM, beginning in October 2023. Join us on Tuesday, 28 February for a discussion on the next steps for the proposal and how US industry committed to Europe can contribute to decarbonisation efforts on both sides of the Atlantic. The meeting will also feature the presentation of AmCham EUâ€™s Strategic Plan and Budget for 2023. Register here.",
