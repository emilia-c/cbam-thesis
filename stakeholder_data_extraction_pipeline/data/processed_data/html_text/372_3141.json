Trade barriers are back, and costs are rising. It's essential for trade compliance teams to adapt strategically to navigate this complex landscape. With fragmented data and tools, a smarter approach is needed. Take control of your data from brokers, suppliers, and government partners. With Veros, you're ready for the future of trade compliance management. Discover how Veros adds value \n         Centralize Customs Data \n         Real-Time Duty Management \n         Automated Processes \n         Trade Master Data Break Through Data Silos Tired of juggling customs reports, invoices, and shipping docs across a maze of systems, emails, and drives? Veros lets you seamlessly import any format—all into one fully searchable, connected database. Say goodbye to fragmented data and hello to centralized visibility. Best of all, there’s no need to replace your current systems or brokers. Veros simply layers on top of what you already use, unlocking value without the headaches. It’s time to set your data free—and put it to work for you. Uncover Hidden Exposure - and Hidden Value Veros doesn’t only show you how much duty you’re paying; it reveals where you’re most vulnerable, even before the impact hits your business directly. Our powerful analytics map both untapped savings and upstream trade war exposure, giving you early warning signals from your broader supply chain (not just your own direct imports) so you can take action before tariffs disrupt your margins. Get a real-time, SKU-level view of your landed costs, identify untapped savings opportunities, and see exactly how much you’re benefiting from special customs procedures—all in one place. With Veros, you gain full financial clarity, operational agility, and the confidence to navigate an unpredictable trade landscape. Let your data do the heavy lifting Streamline your operations with Veros automated workflows. From post-entry audits to the latest reporting requirements like CBAM, our system does the grunt work—so you don’t have to. No more manual data crunching or tedious checks; Veros automatically runs these processes in the background. That way, you can focus on delivering real value while Veros points you to where you can make the biggest impact. Where Customs Meets ESG Meet the Veros Master Data Module: the streamlined way to bring sustainability into your customs processes. Centralize your traditional customs data (HS Codes, Country of Origin) alongside critical ESG attributes—like embedded emissions—and get full visibility into your product’s entire supply chain. As “Green Trade” regulations like CBAM, EUDR, and Forced Labor compliance redefine the rules, customs isn’t just about what you’re importing anymore—it’s about who, where, and how. With Veros, easily integrate emissions reporting and supply chain due diligence at the SKU level, whether it’s in your customs declarations or periodic reporting. The Smart CBAM Management Tool With full visibility into your imports at the SKU level and utilizing our robust emissions master data, CBAM reporting is completed in just a few minutes. Here's how it works: Automatically identify reportable products directly from your customs declarations. Store emissions as master data linked to SKUs, regardless of the source. CBAM reports are created in real-time, combining customs declarations and master data. View supplier emissions and CBAM costs to effectively feed into supply chain design. CBAM is about more than emissions. It starts with knowing what you've imported. Create impact with real data Turn your customs declaration data into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter decisions. By leveraging real-time analytics, your compliance function transforms from a routine checkpoint into a powerful strategic advantage. Because especially now, it’s not just about compliance—it’s a competitive advantage. Meet the Founders What Drives Us Companies are drowning in data demands for global trade, but it's scattered, disconnected, and more of a time-sink than a tool. We've been there. There's a wealth of data out there, but clunky, rigid software makes it hard to harness. Trade management tools shouldn't just cater to big ERPs and streamlined processes; they need to embrace the complex, multi-stakeholder world of global trade compliance. That's why we launched Veros. Veros delivers a sleek, scalable platform that unlocks your global trade data—no system overhauls or lengthy setups required. Transform your compliance data into a competitive edge. Learn how we transformed trade data management for an EV Start Up Need clarification? Can Veros work without systems interfaces? Absolutely! We built Veros to thrive in the real world—where companies often don’t just rely on a single ERP, TMS, or other central data source. In fact, we know most customs data lives outside of your systems environment, e.g. with customs brokers. Our system therefore doesn't depend any one platform for data or triggers. Instead, it lets you import from multiple sources; via Excel, pdf or API, giving you total visibility and control—even in the most complex environments. Our data is a mess, can Veros still work? Definitely. We’ve been there, and we know data is never perfect. That’s why Veros seamlessly layers information from all your sources—customs brokers, government reports, internal transactional data, fragmented master data, and more—to build a complete picture. Then we use modern tech to fill in the gaps, so you can stop worrying about data quality and start focusing on what matters most. How long does implementation take? You can be up and running in a matter of hours. Since Veros doesn’t rely on complex integrations—it simply uses the reports you already have—you can be out of Excel and start delivering value right away. Stay up to date! Be the first to know about Veros product updates and new Global Trade insights to build or refine your compliance function with the tools and knowledge of today’s industry.",
