Such a new stimulus tool should be administratively simple and agile and should offer fast-track and assisted access to SMEs. \n\n\n [Source: Asian Development Bank] \n\n\n Read the article “EU Carbon Tariff Likely to Have Limited Impact on Emissions Without Global Efforts” by Asian Development Bank: https://www.adb.org/news/eu-carbon-tariff-likely-have-limited-impact-emissions-without-global-efforts \n\n Download the “Asian Economic Integration Report 2024: Decarbonizing Global Value Chains – Highlights“: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/945596/aeir-2024-highlights.pdf",
