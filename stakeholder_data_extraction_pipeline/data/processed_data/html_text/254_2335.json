    "text": "Emissions from coal electricity generation account for 20% of Türkiye’s total emissions Türkiye’s coal-fired electricity generation doubled over the past decade, reaching a record high of 118 TWh in 2023. As a result of increased production, coal-fired power plants caused 111 million tons of carbon emissions in 2023. In simpler terms, one-fifth of Türkiye’s emissions stemmed solely from coal-fired power plants. The annual growth rate of emissions from coal-fired plants was 6.2% between 2012 and 2023. On the other hand, the majority of coal reserves in Türkiye have a low energy potential, necessitating high coal consumption per unit of electricity generation. While approximately 1,700 kg of coal is consumed per 1 MWh of electricity produced in lignite-fired plants, imported coal-fired plants, which have higher energy potential compared to domestic coal, use 350 kg of coal per 1 MWh of electricity generated. Furthermore, due to the relatively higher efficiency of coal plants in the European Union, Türkiye has had to consume 50% more coal to achieve the same amount of electricity generation.",
