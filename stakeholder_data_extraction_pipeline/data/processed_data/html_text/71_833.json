This acquisition, expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year, would mark Jindal Group’s first foray into the European market. Valued at approximately €150 million (₹1,000 crore), the deal aligns with the group’s global expansion strategy. Jindal already has a significant presence in Australia, Mozambique, and Oman, and this acquisition would position the company strategically as Europe moves towards green steel with policies like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Jindal Group’s First Acquisition in Europe Strategic Move into European Steel Market \nJindal Group, owned by Indian industrialist Naveen Jindal, is in advanced negotiations to acquire Czech-based Vitkovice Steel, marking the company’s first acquisition in Europe. This expansion move is seen as a pivotal step for Jindal’s broader global strategy to strengthen its foothold in international markets. With the acquisition expected to close by the end of the fiscal year, Jindal Group is positioning itself to enter a market that is increasingly focusing on sustainability and green steel production. Valuation and Deal Structure €150 Million Acquisition via Jindal Steel International \nThe acquisition is being negotiated through Jindal Steel International, the overseas arm of Jindal Group. Sources familiar with the talks estimate the deal to be valued at around €150 million, or approximately ₹1,000 crore. This significant investment reflects Jindal’s commitment to scaling its global operations and entering the European steel sector at a time when the industry is transitioning towards environmentally friendly practices. Global Expansion in Key Geographies Existing Presence in Australia, Mozambique, and Oman \nWhile this would be Jindal’s first European acquisition, the group already has a notable presence in other key regions, including Australia, Mozambique, and Oman. Its operations span across steel, power, and mining sectors. The acquisition of Vitkovice Steel will expand Jindal’s steel manufacturing capabilities and allow it to tap into the European market, which is undergoing significant regulatory changes to promote green steel and reduce carbon emissions. European Steel Market and CBAM Capitalizing on Europe’s Move Towards Green Steel \nJindal Group’s entry into the European market comes at a time when the region is implementing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which taxes carbon-intensive imports. This move is designed to incentivize greener manufacturing practices, particularly in the steel industry. By acquiring Vitkovice Steel, Jindal will gain a foothold in this evolving market, positioning itself as a player in Europe’s transition towards greener steel production. Jindal’s Commitment to Green Steel Production Setting Up a Hydrogen-Based Steel Unit in Oman \nIn line with global trends toward sustainability, Jindal Group is also setting up a hydrogen-based steel manufacturing unit in Oman under its subsidiary Vulcan Green Steel (VGS). This initiative underscores the group’s dedication to environmental sustainability and green steel production, which is becoming increasingly critical as global regulatory frameworks like CBAM take effect. The Oman project will complement the European acquisition by aligning Jindal’s operations with global sustainability trends.",
