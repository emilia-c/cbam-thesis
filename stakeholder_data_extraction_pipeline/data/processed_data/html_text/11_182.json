Exports are currently not covered by the European Commission’s CBAM proposal. However, there are concerns that the exclusion of exports will open-up an export-related carbon leakage channel, thereby harming EU competitiveness and climate ambition. In this report, ERCST presents its recommendations on how to address exports in the EU CBAM. Download the Policymaker Summary here.
