    "text": "Delhi, 26 June 2024 – A new report from the energy think tank Ember highlights the crucial role of renewables-based electrification in avoiding 17% of the anticipated carbon emissions from India’s heavy industry by 2030. This report indicates possible near and long term strategies to slash emissions as India negotiates with the EU bloc on mechanisms to comply with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). CBAM is a regulatory framework that imposes a carbon tariff on imports to the EU. To fully decarbonise their electricity use and remain competitive in the global market, India’s heavy industries require 120 GW of dedicated renewable energy capacity by 2030. The report focuses on the steel, cement, petrochemicals, aluminium and ammonia sectors. Decarbonising these emission-intensive “heavy” industries can significantly benefit both India’s industrial sector and renewable energy ecosystem.",
