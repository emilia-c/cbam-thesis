    "text": "The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aims to prevent carbon leakage by adjusting import costs based on carbon intensity, ensuring that EU climate policies like the Green Deal are not undermined by carbon-intensive production outside Europe. While CBAM may drive sustainable growth and investment in low-carbon technologies, it could also raise import costs and challenge the competitiveness of European carbon-intensive sectors, such as steel and cement, while straining trade relations with non-EU countries. The event will feature expert presentations, case studies, and discussions on CBAM’s broader geopolitical and economic effects. The workshop is upon invitation only. For more information, please send an e-mail to [email protected] This event is organised by FSR under the framework of the SPES project financed by the Horizon Europe Programme of the European Commission, Grant agreement ID: 101094551.",
