This national sectoral average approach ultimately results in firms paying twice: once for renewable energy and a second time for CBAM fees.” The I-REC Standard Foundation has proposed potential means of solving this issue: through greater granularity in renewable energy procurement and traceability and the role that energy attribute certificates (EACs) can play in promoting greater transparency and accountability within renewable energy markets. For more information on this subject, contact the I-REC Standard secretariat at secretariat@irecstandard.org.",
