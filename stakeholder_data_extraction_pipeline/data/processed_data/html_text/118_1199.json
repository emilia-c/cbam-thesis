What is Turkey's Status in Terms of Climate Change? Turkey has made significant strides in the fight against climate change in recent years. By ratifying the Paris Agreement in 2021, it announced a target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2053. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) has been updated, renewable energy investments have increased, and the Green Deal Action Plan has been implemented. However, challenges such as dependence on fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and deforestation persist. With steps like carbon pricing mechanisms and incentives for sustainable production, Turkey aims to accelerate its transition to a low-carbon economy. What is the European Green Deal (EU Green Deal)? Climate change is a global threat, and countries are starting to implement their action plans by setting climate goals. In this regard, Europe has published the European Green Deal (EU Green Deal),which outlines its climate targets. In the deal released in 2019, Europe stated that it aims to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. The deal emphasizes that Europe will develop a growth strategy to transform its industries and economy to achieve this goal. It also highlights that key sectors such as energy, transportation, agriculture, construction, and finance will be reshaped within the framework of climate goals. What is the Importance of the European Green Deal for Turkey? The European Green Deal is of critical importance for Turkey. As Turkey is a Customs Union partner with the EU, its commercial activities are highly dynamic. According to the Ministry of Trade's 2021 data, the European Union holds a 41% share of Turkey's $93 billion export, making it the largest partner in Turkey's total exports. Therefore, due to both the intensity of trade relations and the sustainable development goals, Turkey will also be part of the European Green Deal. What is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)? The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a new carbon tax system by the European Union that will come into full effect in 2026. CBAM imposes additional costs on products with high carbon emissions, such as cement, steel, aluminum, fertilizers, hydrogen, and electricity, that are exported to the EU. The aim is to prevent carbon leakage and promote low-carbon production on a global scale. For countries like Turkey, which engage in intensive trade with the EU, the process of aligning with carbon emission reduction is of great significance.",
