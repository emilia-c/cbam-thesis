    "text": "One of the biggest challenges of our time is the responsible use of the resources we have. At thyssenkrupp Materials Eastern Europe, we accept this fact and act accordingly. This is reflected in the changing needs of society and in new EU regulations such as the Carbon Balancing Mechanism (CBAM) and the Corporate Sustainability Directive (CSRD). To achieve their sustainability goals, companies first need transparency on the drivers of their CO2 emissions. With our independently verified Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) certificates, we can now provide you with this information. The calculation includes all direct and indirect emissions along the entire value chain and helps you measure your environmental impact so you can take action to reduce emissions.
