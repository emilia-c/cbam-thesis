Together with other NGOs, we support a fair and effective CBAM, designed and implemented as an alternative to current EU ETS carbon leakage measures such as free allowances and indirect cost compensation. We believe that agreeing on a CBAM separately from the EU ETS Directive would be detrimental to its implementation, and risk undermining the level of ambition and decarbonisation incentives of the Fit for 55 package European Environmental Bureau Rue des Deux Eglises 14-16, B-1000 Brussels Tel: +32 2 289 10 90 E-mail: eeb@eeb.org If you have a complaint, please study our complaints policy and contact us at complaints@eeb.org.
