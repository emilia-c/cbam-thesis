As a lightweight metal with recyclable characteristics, aluminum is considered green that benefits European sectors to reduce carbon emissions and has the potential to play a pivotal role in Europe's transition towards a greener future. However, lots of work still needed to be done in legislation and policymaking, low carbon energy transition, technology development, sustainable value chain, etc. The 2nd European Green Aluminium Summit 2024 will take aluminium carbon reduction as the theme, unites key stakeholders from aluminium industry, policy regulators, major industry suppliers and technology providers to address hot topics such as green aluminium trend, net zero roadmap, energy transition, green technology development, aluminium recycling, decarbonization solutions, etc. aiming to gather best practices/insights in aluminium industry towards net zero.",
