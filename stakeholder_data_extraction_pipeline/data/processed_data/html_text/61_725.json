The conference aimed to take stock of the most recent developments in climate policy globally and what we can expect on carbon pricing, low-carbon innovation and the energy transition for the coming decades. This 2023 conference included eleven sessions spanning over three days in a mix of public and closed-doors sessions. Hosted by Jos Delbeke and his team, some high-profile representatives from the world of policymaking, business and academia, were present, including Kurt Vandenberghe, Director General of DG CLIMA at the European Commission, Catherine Stewart, Government of Canada Climate Change Ambassador, and Kay Harrison, Climate Change Ambassador of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EUI Carbon Markets Day focused on prominent topics such as the impact of the war in Ukraine on the green transition, how to agree on the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and improving the environmental integrity of the Voluntary Carbon Market. This second edition of the EUI Climate Week also co-hosted the Florence Process with DG Climate Action, bringing together representatives of the EU, the UK, the US, China, Switzerland, New Zealand and Quebec, to exchange policy experiences from their respective emissions trading programmes. The conference was concluded by climate-related sessions at the State of the Union and featured a keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board, and Vice Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank.
