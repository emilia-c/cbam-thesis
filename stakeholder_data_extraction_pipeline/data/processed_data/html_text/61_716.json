    "text": "The CBAM has started, and early signs of its acceptance are encouraging. After 2 quarters of data gathering, experience is being gained. However, several important questions still require answering. Should more complex manufactured products be incorporated into CBAM? What additional sectors might be considered for extension of CBAM? On reductions of CBAM liability for a carbon price paid in the country of production of goods, what are the specific criteria that need to be fulfilled to qualify? Does a tax have to be explicitly called a carbon tax? What should the Commission be doing with regard to bilateral agreements and \"carbon clubs\" in this context? Moderation: Ewa Krukowska, EU Reporter, Bloomberg Panellists: • Gerassimos Thomas, Director General, DG TAXUD, European Commission • Kurt Van Dender, Acting Head of the Tax Policy and Statistics Division, OECD • Kevin Kolevar, Vice President, Global Policy and Government, Dow • Susanne Dröge, Head of Department Climate Protection and Energy, German Environment Agency Conclusion: Peter Vis, Senior Research Associate, Florence School of Transnational Governance, European University Institute All deliberations will take place under the Chatham House rule (no views or positions may be attributed publicly to any participant).
