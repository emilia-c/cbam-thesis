It was a great event, with a number of customers attending both in person and virtual, and joining us from both the UK and across Europe. Nemo Link were joined by guest speakers from Elia and JAO, discussing a number of topics relevant to our customers including Operational Performance, Commercial and Market Updates, Regulatory Updates with a focus on the EU CBAM and having an interactive session on System considerations. The forum also provided an opportunity for our customers to provide much valued feedback on Nemo Link and we are grateful to all who shared their thoughts and comments. A copy of the presentation can be found here. For more information regarding this event, or future forums, please contact the Customer Service Team.",
