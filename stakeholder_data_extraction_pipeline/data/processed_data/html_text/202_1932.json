Cmex also gave a talk at the annual conference on the subject of reducing conflict between HGVs and cyclists/pedestrians. The event was attended by over 500 delegates with Police Officers from various UK divisions, emergency services and accident investigators, as well as experts from the UK and abroad. The aim of the Institute is to promote road safety for the benefit of the public by improving the technical and general knowledge , and skills, of persons involved in the investigating road traffic collisions. It also seeks to improve the standards of safety of vehicles and roads of all kinds. Cemexâ€™s vehicles were present to provide experience and understanding of the direct and indirect vision in trucks and safety devices, CCTV, and safety systems that are installed to reduce the risk of incidents with cyclists and pedestrians.
