Cazes. “This message is heard by Glass for Europe. Europe’s flat glass industry shares this ambition to deliver massive CO2 emissions reduction as soon as possible.” The flat glass industry is working hard to cut its emissions, but a more enabling policy framework and effective energy infrastructures are both needed to speed up the transformation process. The European Union should build up an environment that supports industrial investments and ensure access to decarbonised sources of energy in much greater quantity. Mechanisms safeguarding the competitiveness of industrial front-runners should be ensured. Listen to the full message.",
