    "text": "CBAM SIMPLIFICATION PROPOSAL PUBLISHED The European Commission has presented a CBAM revision proposal as part of the first Omnibus Package, aimed at reducing administrative burdens across EU legislation. This initiative follows widespread concerns from businesses, particularly SMEs, about the complexity of compliance requirements under the current CBAM framework. The proposal seeks to simplify reporting obligations, ease the authorisation process, and ensure CBAM remains effective in tackling carbon leakage without unnecessary trade disruptions. CLECAT welcomes the inclusion of several key recommendations it has consistently advocated for. Notably, the introduction of a de minimis threshold will exempt occasional importers of small CBAM quantities, significantly reducing compliance costs for SMEs. The proposal also recognises the challenges faced by customs intermediaries, allowing for CBAM representatives to support importers without assuming full liability. Furthermore, the Commission acknowledges the need for better use of customs data and streamlined reporting obligations, aligning with CLECAT’s call for a more efficient system. The optional consultation procedure for CBAM authorisation will also ease administrative burdens. The proposed changes are a step in the right direction, ensuring CBAM remains a workable tool rather than a trade barrier. CLECAT will continue engaging with policymakers to ensure the final regulation reflects the realities of the logistics sector.
