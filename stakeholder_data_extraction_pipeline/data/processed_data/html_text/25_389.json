    "text": "The Path to Net Zero: An Ambitious Yet Achievable Roadmap In May 2024, CEMBUREAU unveiled its updated 2050 Net Zero Roadmap, redefining the European cement industry’s commitment to tackling climate change. This comprehensive strategy charts a course for decarbonisation across the cement and concrete value chain, revisiting goals and incorporating new insights since the publication of the original roadmap in 2020. Key ambitions along the way: By 2030: A 37% reduction in CO2 emissions in cement production and a 50% reduction across the entire value chain. By 2040: A 78% reduction in cement production emissions and 93% across the value chain. By 2050: Achieving carbon neutrality in cement production, with the potential to achieve carbon-negative outcomes across the value chain. The roadmap underscores the critical role of innovative technologies, supportive policies, and industry-wide collaboration in achieving these milestones. It also highlights the policy conditions necessary to meet these goals, including a watertight Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to ensure fair competition, stronger financial mechanisms, guaranteed access to decarbonised energy and raw materials, and the creation of lead markets for circular and low-carbon products. Accelerating Progress: Innovations in Action CEMBUREAU has an interactive map showcasing over 100 decarbonisation projects currently underway in Europe, demonstrating the industry’s commitment to translating ambition into reality. These projects span the value chain, employing cutting-edge solutions such as carbon capture, alternative fuels, and circular economy practices. Regular updates to the map reflect the ongoing efforts of the European cement industry to scale up innovation and adopt transformative technologies. This map is not only a testament to the progress already made but also a vital tool for policymakers, investors, and stakeholders to identify opportunities, address bottlenecks, and foster collaboration across sectors.",
