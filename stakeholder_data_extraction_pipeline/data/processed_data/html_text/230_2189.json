The chairman said that Turkey cannot afford to miss this green transformation and the delay will be costly. \r\n\r\n      The Chairman said that from an economic point of view, the carbon tax is expected to cost Turkey more than 60 billion dollars by 2040. He said Turkey's non-participation in the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) program was a loss and emphasized that Turkey had not benefited enough from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Easier and cheaper access to the Middle East and European markets by India and China means increased competition for Turkey in the near future. \r\n 安卡拉產業協會 土耳其 CBAM 碳稅 中國 印度 Ankara Chamber of Industry Turkey carbon tax China India 扣件 國際展會 惠達雜誌 匯達實業 外銷媒合 廣告刊登 螺絲五金 五金工具 紧固件 台灣扣件展 印度新德里螺絲展 越南河內螺絲展 墨西哥瓜達拉哈拉螺絲展 美國拉斯維加斯螺絲暨機械設備展 波蘭克拉科夫螺絲展 義大利米蘭螺絲展 德國司徒加特螺絲展 wire Dusseldorf FASTENER FAIR INDIA FASTENER FAIR VIETNAM FASTENER FAIR MEXICO FASTENER POLAND FASTENER FAIR ITALY FASTENER FAIR GLOBAL FASTENER WORLD \r\n              READ NEXT\r\n             \r\n            \r\n              \r\n             Subscribe",
