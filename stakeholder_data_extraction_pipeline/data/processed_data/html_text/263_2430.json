Through case studies and exercises, you will gain the tools to meet regulations, enhance transparency, and avoid risks. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) is transforming global trade by ensuring that commodities like coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber are sourced without contributing to deforestation. Businesses must now demonstrate compliance through traceability, due diligence, and risk assessments to maintain access to the EU market. EUDR is not just a legal requirement. It marks a fundamental shift toward sustainable supply chains. Companies that fail to comply face penalties, reputational risks, and potential market exclusion, while those that adapt early can gain a competitive edge and enhance their global credibility. Achieving compliance requires robust data collection, supply chain transparency, and proactive engagement with suppliers. This workshop provides practical strategies, industry case studies, and best practices to help businesses navigate EUDR requirements, mitigate risks, and implement effective sustainability measures. Companies importing key commodities into the EU must establish robust traceability and due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). This is a crucial phase in preparing for full enforcement, where non-compliance may lead to penalties and restricted market access. Businesses will be required to provide geolocation data, risk assessments, and deforestation-free verification for affected products such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber. Early investment in supply chain transparency, digital tracking tools, and supplier engagement can offer a competitive advantage while minimizing future compliance risks. The shift toward deforestation-free trade will impact pricing, sourcing strategies, and supply chain structures, making early preparation essential. We are in a critical transition phase where companies must act now to align with EUDR. This training will provide best practices, case studies, and compliance strategies to help businesses navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and ensure full readiness. Program Overview Day 1: Understand the European Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and its impact on industries, focusing on the causes and consequences of deforestation and forest degradation. Learn about the deforestation-free requirements and due diligence processes outlined in the EUDR. Analyze case studies like the Congo Basin and Ghana to explore real-world challenges and opportunities for compliance. Day 2: Delve into traceability systems and geolocation technologies critical for ensuring EUDR compliance. Learn the stepwise approach to building transparent, traceable supply chains and how various stakeholders, from farmers to businesses, contribute to the process. Use case studies such as Tony Chocolonelyâ€™s deforestation-free cocoa initiative to create your own compliance roadmap for a sustainable supply chain. Day 3: Dive deeper into due diligence practices, focusing on data collection, verification, and risk assessment strategies. Learn how to mitigate compliance risks and work effectively with suppliers to ensure traceability and sustainability. Participate in group exercises to address real-world compliance challenges and explore practical solutions for managing risk in supply chains. Day 4: Study emerging technologies such as satellite imagery, blockchain, and IoT devices that can enhance supply chain transparency and compliance with the EUDR. Learn from successful real-life case studies and collaborate with peers to develop customized compliance strategies tailored to your specific industry needs, preparing your business for future EUDR requirements.",
