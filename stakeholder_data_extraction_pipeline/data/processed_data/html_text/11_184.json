In order to address the risk of carbon leakage from the EU ETS, in July 2021 the European Commission has put forward a proposal for a Carbon Border Adjust Mechanism (CBAM). Over the last fifteen months this proposal has gone through the EU legislative process, which is now nearing conclusion and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. The CBAM will not only impact trade between EU and its partners, but is also leading to significant changes to how other countries are approaching climate change. This event was an open discussion with Mr. Gerassimos Thomas who is the Director General of Directorate of EU Taxation and Customs Union which has the primary responsibility for the CBAM legislation. In this discussion, Mr. Gerassimos was joined by international stakeholders to discuss the current direction of CBAM as well as their reactions to the introduction of this EU legislation.",
