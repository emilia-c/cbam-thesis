This will give American manufactures an advantage in the marketplace due to their lower carbon footprint. Sen. Graham is not the only Republican Senator thinking about introducing a CBAM bill. Democrats are not far behind, Sen. Coons, Sen. Whitehouse as well and President Biden have CBAM bills in mind.Â  Both parties have different reasons for pushing for the CBAM, but the key point here is that it is on the table. If a CBAM is passed it would be another big step forward for the climate. If you remember, a CBAM was part of the EICDA. NO gloom or doom even with the divided congress, it appears that climate action is moving forward.
