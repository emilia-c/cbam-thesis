    "text": "Europe Jacques Delors has a new podcast series: Re-thinking Europe Re-thinking Europe gives an insight into how the EU is trying to become a climate neutral continent by 2050, unpacking its rather complex web of initiatives and legislative packages. In the first episodes, we will explore EU trade policy and how it can be 'greened', starting with one of the EU's most important pieces of legislation in this area: The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). With our guests Sara Svensson, Policy Analyst at the European Roundtable on Climate Change and Sustainable Transition (ERCST), and Maria Elena Scoppio, Director for Indirect Taxation and Tax Administration at DG TAXUD (Taxation and Customs Union) at the European Commission, we discuss how the implementation of CBAM will affect third countries, how the EU is supporting businesses in this transition, and how CBAM contributes to the EU's efforts to mitigate climate change. As the European Union pioneers sustainable solutions, the Re-thinking Europe podcast offers a front-row seat to an unfolding story of global significance. From carbon leakage to emissions trading, this first episode, “Trade, Carbon and Borders: Inside the EU CBAM”, provides a nuanced understanding of how these policies are shaping the future of global trade and environmental governance.",
