CBAM effectively entails a levy on greenhouse gas emissions embedded in certain goods imported into the EU. An impactful requirement is that impacted importers must calculate and provide data to EU authorities on the embedded GHG emissions of the goods they import. CBAM has an impact on the supply chain from both a logistical and financial perspective. We discuss all implications during this Webcast.
