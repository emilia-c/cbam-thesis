    "text": "Cerame-Unie welcomes the decision of the European Parliament’s plenary session to reaffirm the complementarity of CBAM with existing carbon leakage measures in its Report \"Towards a WTO-compatible EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\". However, Cerame-Unie regrets that the Resolution calls for the inclusion of all sectors covered by the ETS in the scope of a future CBAM.
