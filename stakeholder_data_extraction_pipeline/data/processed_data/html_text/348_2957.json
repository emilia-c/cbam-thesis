    "text": "The EU ETS and global level playing field: the carbon leakage listLeonardo ENERGY In the design of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Europe in a cost-effective manner, the co-legislators introduced an element aimed at restoring global level playing field for the industrial sectors which would see their international competitiveness hampered by the additional costs brought by European policy. It was decided that sectors exposed to a high risk of carbon leakage would benefit from a certain amount of free allocation of emission allowances as long as their competitors outside of the EU are not subject to comparable policies. The definition of “carbon leakage” itself is multifaceted and disputed. The system that has been built ad hoc at EU level is no less complex and burdensome. It has resulted in the elaboration of a series of eligibility steps, going from the periodic carbon leakage list through product-specific benchmarks to the application of a reduction factor aiming at keeping the level of emissions under the cap set in the Directive. This course will look at this system from the legislative principles viewpoint as well as from the practical side based on past experience. It will also present some perspectives from the EU ETS review exercise launched in July 2015. Last but not least, it will revert back to the global perspective by observing the state of play in the aftermath of the COP21. \"Climate & energy policies: post 2020 EU ETS\" | Dr Laura Cohen | EPCF 2014Cerame-Unie \"Climate & energy policies: post 2020 EU ETS\" by Dr Laura Cohen, CEO of British Ceramic Confederation. Presentation made at the 15th European Parliament Ceramics Forum on 3 December 2014. This document summarizes the results of modeling pathways for Germany's energy transition and achieving its climate targets. It finds that: 1) A fast phase out of coal in Germany by 2030-2035 can help meet short term climate targets but stronger European cooperation is needed to achieve long term 2050 targets. 2) National actions through a \"Coalition of the Willing\" among some EU states can help bridge gaps but will not be sufficient on their own. 3) A fast coal phase out would increase electricity costs slightly but require large additional system costs of €41-106 billion that would need to be compensated. 4) Replacing coal primarily relies on increased gas, imports, This document summarizes the results of a study applying a methodology called \"model archaeology\" to analyze the development of the UK MARKAL energy system model over multiple versions from 2002 to 2012. Model archaeology examines changes to a model's inputs (e.g. technology parameters) and outputs (e.g. energy consumption) between versions. The study found the UK MARKAL model evolved through four stages - initial development, experimentation and incremental improvement, reflection, and maturity and reimagining. Input and output metrics were analyzed to understand how changes to technologies, constraints, and parameters influenced outputs over time as the model balanced complexity and accuracy. Costs for CO2 capture in cement manufacture - Duncan Barker, Mott MacDonaldGlobal CCS Institute The document summarizes information from a presentation given by Duncan Barker on costs for CO2 capture in cement manufacture. It provides background on different CO2 capture technologies for cement plants, including post-combustion and oxy-combustion capture. It also shares cost data from previous studies on retrofitting and new-build cement plants with CO2 capture, which found total costs ranging from €46-107 per tonne of CO2 avoided. The challenges of accurately estimating CO2 capture costs for the cement industry are discussed. The economics of industrial CCS projects at existing UK sites by 2025: Our approach, some findings and some questions - plenary presentation given by Harsh Pershad at the UKCCSRC Cardiff Biannual Meeting, 10-11 September 2014 This document discusses carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the context of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and Clean Development Mechanism. It provides an overview of how CCS relates to these programs, including key requirements and documents. The three main topics covered are: 1) CCS in the EU ETS, 2) CCS in the CDM, and 3) the verification process required by both programs. IRJET - Experimental Investigation of Exhaust Emissions using Catalytic Conve...IRJET Journal The document experimentally investigates the effect of a catalytic converter in reducing exhaust emissions from a diesel engine. Tests were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine at various loads without and with a catalytic converter. The catalytic converter significantly reduced levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in the exhaust by catalyzing redox reactions to convert the pollutants to less harmful gases. Emissions were found to increase with engine load but were lowered in each case through the use of the catalytic converter. EdExcel Paper 3 Synoptic Essay (25 Marker) on Carbon Taxestutor2u Here is a revision webinar on building an answer for the synoptic paper. A carbon tax is an environmental tax on producers based on each tonne of CO2 emitted from supplying goods and services. Some economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern, say taxes of $100 per tonne could be needed by 2030 which would mean a carbon price of around £75 – this is over ten times higher than the current carbon emissions price in the ETS and would therefore represent a significant government intervention which would have micro and macroeconomic effects. Emissions Trading Media Briefing February 2009David Hone An overview of emissions trading (cap-and-trade), how it works and a focus on allocation of allowances. This presentation was given by Shell to a group of London media representatives on February 18th 2009. The document discusses low carbon technologies for energy-intensive industries in the UK. It notes that these industries are responsible for 45% of business and public sector carbon emissions in the UK. Over the next decade, existing technologies like improved efficiency will be used, but beyond 2020 transformative technologies like carbon capture and storage will be needed to significantly reduce emissions. The document outlines various policies and incentives in place to support industry investment in low carbon technologies while balancing emissions reductions with keeping industry in the UK. Pushing the limits of TIAM - Achieving well-below 2 degrees scenariosIEA-ETSAP 1) The document discusses modifications made to the TIAM energy systems model to better represent pathways limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C. 2) Modifications included faster deployment of low-carbon technologies, lower demand through behavior changes and efficiency, and advanced technologies. 3) Model runs with the modifications resulted in lower cumulative CO2 emissions over 2005-2100 compared to the original model, bringing the emissions closer to a 1.5 degree C pathway. However, very deep decarbonization poses challenges in terms of plausibility. The document discusses the role of universities in addressing climate change. It summarizes the work of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body established under the UK Climate Change Act to advise the government on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The CCC recommends that the UK reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050 from 1990 levels through measures like decarbonizing electricity generation, increasing renewable energy and electric vehicles, and improving building efficiency. Universities have a key role to play in the innovation needed to achieve these targets through research, developing new technologies, and training graduates with low-carbon skills. Karsten Neuhoff.

Here we study about the cancer as well as its treatment that is supportive to the students of semester VI of Bachelor of Pharmacy. Cancer is a disease of cells of characterized by Progressive, Persistent, Perverted (abnormal), Purposeless and uncontrolled Proliferation of tissues. There are many types of cancer that are harmful to the human body which are responsible to cause the disease condition. The position 7 of guanine residues in DNA is especially susceptible. Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug converted to the active metabolite aldophosphamide in the liver. Procarbazine is a weak MAO inhibitor; produces sedation and other CNS effects, and can interact with foods and drugs. Methotrexate is one of the most commonly used anticancer drugs. Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist. 6-MP and 6-TG are activated to their ribonucleotides, which inhibit purine ring biosynthesis and nucleotide inter conversion. Pyrimidine analogue used in antineoplastic, antifungal and anti psoriatic agents. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a pyrimidine analog. It is a complex diterpin taxane obtained from bark of the Western yew tree. Actinomycin D is obtained from the fungus of Streptomyces species. Gefitinib and Erlotinib inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. Sunitinib inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases like platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) Rituximab target antigen on the B cells causing lysis of these cells. Prednisolone is 4 times more potent than hydrocortisone, also more selective glucocorticoid, but fluid retention does occur with high doses. Estradiol is a major regulator of growth for the subset of breast cancers that express the estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1). Finasteride and dutasteride inhibit conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in prostate (and other tissues), have palliative effect in advanced carcinoma prostate; occasionally used. Chemotherapy in most cancers (except curable cancers) is generally palliative and suppressive. Chemotherapy is just one of the modes in the treatment of cancer. Other modes like radiotherapy and surgery are also employed to ensure 'total cell kill'.

Upstream Company production Downstream (1)During the transitional CBAM period, indirect emissions need to be reported for all CBAM sectors. (2)Direct emissions include emissions from the production of heating and cooling, even if that production takes place outside the installation. 10 Scope 1 Direct Emissions generated from the production of CBAM goods at installation level2 Input material under CBAM scope (in case of complex goods) Scope 3 Indirect Raw materials, transportation and distribution, previous waste, etc Electricity consumed for the production of CBAM goods1 Scope 2 Indirect Consumption, transportation and distribution and end of life Scope 3 Indirect In CBAM scope Not in CBAM scope Partially in CBAM scope Emissions under CBAM scope 12.

India exports these goods worth around USD 8 billion annually to the EU.  Compliance Issues: CBAM shall create administrative and technical challenges for Indian producers and importers, who will have to monitor, calculate, report and verify their emissions according to the EU standards.  India’s smaller firms will lose out, as they did when the EU imposed a strict regime in 2006 (EU REACH) to regulate chemical imports.  Against FTA Norms: CBAM is criticized as a non-tariff barrier that undermines zero duty FTAs.  Contradicts EU and Developed Nations' Commitment to Green Transition.  Undermines the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibility' by restricting the developing world's ability to industrialize. India’s Concerns 21. Implementing Regulation Principles of EU’s approach • The transitional period is a learning phase for all: • Understanding respective roles and tasks • Collection of information • Facilitate smooth roll out of the mechanism after the 2025 • The information collected will allow the European Commission to further specify and finalise methodology and find synergies with existing monitoring schemes. • The information collected will feed into the review of the mechanism by 2025 and provide further clarity of the functioning • Reporting flexibilities reflect the above and aim to introduce openness and balancing a smooth introduction with information needs 22. The CBAM methodology From installation to goods approach Production energy intensive industries & electricity generation & commercial aviation Raw material Fuel Simple goods CBAM ETS ETS and CBAM Complex goods CBAM goods GHG emissions Natural gas • The scope of the ETS is based on installations carrying out activities leading to GHG emissions. • The scope of the CBAM is based on “goods”. • Therefore the CBAM methodology will translate ETS methods for the calculation of emissions at installation level into methods for imported goods • This means setting rules to narrow the system boundaries from production sites down to the level of goods • But a key difference between CBAM and ETS is the distinction simple and complex goods 24. Steps to determine embedded emissions Step 1: Define the installation’s boundaries, production processes and production routes Step 2: Perform monitoring: • monitoring direct emissions at installation level, originating from fuel combustion • monitoring flows of net measurable heat • monitoring electricity consumption • monitoring the consumption of precursors. Step 3: Attribute Emissions to production processes, then to goods Step 4: For complex goods, add embedded emissions of precursors Step 5: Monitoring and reporting of indirect emissions Step 5: Monitoring and reporting of indirect emissions 28. Monitoring methods for direct emissions Standard methodology Based on predetermined emission factors that represent the average emissions per unit of input or output. The mass balance method Based on the idea that what comes into an installation cannot be more than what comes out. 1. Calculation-based methodology 2. Measurement-based methodology Continuous emissions monitoring system Continuous measurements of emissions from emission sources at the installation level. Emissions may be measured directly in the stack or using extractive procedures with a measurement instrument located close to the stack. 29. Monitoring methods for direct emissions 3. Other monitoring systems Until 31 December 2024, the level of embedded emissions may be calculated using an ‘eligible monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system’, i.e. one of the following methods, if they lead to similar coverage and accuracy of emissions data:  a carbon pricing scheme where the installation is located, or  a compulsory emission monitoring scheme where the installation is located, or  an emission monitoring scheme at the installation which can include verification by an accredited verifier. 30. Typical Elements of Monitoring Methodology • Data collection (metering data, invoices, production protocols, stock determination etc.). • Sampling of materials and fuels. • Laboratory analyses of fuels and materials. • Maintenance and calibration of meters. • Description of the calculations and formulae to be used. • Documentation of standard values used and their sources. • Control activities (e.g. four-eyes principle for data collection). • Data archiving (including security to guard against manipulation). • Regular identification of improvement possibilities in monitoring system. 31. Elements of Procedures for Monitoring Methodology • Managing responsibilities and competency of personnel - description of roles and responsibilities. • Data flow and control procedures. • Quality assurance measures (checks to be carried out). • Estimation method(s) for substituting data where data gaps are identified. • Regular review of the monitoring methodology for its appropriateness. • A sampling plan and process for revision, if required. • Procedures for methods of analyses, if applicable. • Procedure for demonstrating evidence for equivalence to EN ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation of laboratories. • Procedures for use of measurement-based methodologies. • Procedure for regular review and update of the list of products and precursors produced and/or imported. 33.
