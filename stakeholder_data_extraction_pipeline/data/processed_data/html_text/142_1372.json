    "text": "Judith Kirton-Darling, General Secretary of industriAll Europe, and Axel Eggert, Director General of EUROFER, published a letter to Ursula von der Leyen, President, and Stéphane Séjourné, Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, to highlight the threats to the sector and make demands under the Steel Action Plan. Europe is currently facing an extraordinary crisis, so an emergency meeting to address short-term emergency measures and outline a comprehensive EU trade initiative is announced. Early next year, a European Steel Summit is to be organized to lower energy prices, strengthen CBAM, secure access to raw materials, and increase investment. EUROFER stated that unfair trade practices, high energy prices, ineffective CBAM, raw material shortages, and possible job losses are critical challenges for the European steel industry. China's low cost steel exports and high energy prices weaken the EU's competitiveness, prevent decarbonization efforts, and lead to job losses.",
