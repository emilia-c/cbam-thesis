During the online Technical Commission’s meeting, participants received an update on the activities of each Project Team and exchanged on the Machinery Product Regulation proposal with Ms. Sylwia Kosinska, advisor of the EPP Group in the European Parliament’s Internal Market and Consumers Committee (IMCO). The group also discussed about the proposal for a General Product Safety Regulation and the impact of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for the construction machinery sector. Other topics debated included the update on the future legislation harmonising road circulation requirements for mobile machinery and environmental issues such as REACH restrictions and the activities in progress related to the Sustainable Products Initiative (SPI). Finally, the Technical Commission was updated on the regulatory state of play between the EU and the UK. The next Technical Week will take place from 6th to 9th December 2021. More news",
