    "text": "Orgalim has undertaken the present study to quantify the potential impacts of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and of the phaseout of Free Allocation under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS FA) on the competitiveness of Europe’s technology industries. The study is based on a survey of 14 member companies of Orgalim-affiliated industry associations. Companies provided data on one or more products of their choice, in relation to production costs, prices, steel and aluminium content as well as supply chain. The study estimated the impact of CBAM and of the phaseout of ETS FA on production costs and profit margins. An analysis was then carried out to determine the carbon leakage risk for the products in scope, based on the EU Emissions Trading System methodology for the assessment of carbon leakage.
