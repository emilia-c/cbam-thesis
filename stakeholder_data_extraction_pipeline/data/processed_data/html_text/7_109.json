    "text": "Orgalim represents Europe’s technology industries, comprised of 770,000 innovative companies spanning the mechanical engineering, electronics, ICT and metal technology branches. As Europe’s largest manufacturing sector with a strong export orientation, the European technology industry is a major downstream user of raw materials that will fall under the scope of CBAM, such as steel and aluminium. Our members foresee a significant rise in the cost of primary manufacturing inputs that will eventually result in higher prices for our products. Therefore, CBAM will result in a loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis third country operators, who can access raw materials at competitive prices and therefore enjoy an advantage both on the EU market and on third country markets to which the EU technology industry exports.
