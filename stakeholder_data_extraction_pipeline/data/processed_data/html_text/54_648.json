View Pricing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz Advocates for Green Steel Transition In a recent visit to Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe in Duisburg, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz emphasized the imperative shift towards climate-neutral steel production, a sentiment echoed in Manager Magazine. Scholz, a key candidate in the upcoming February 23 elections, highlighted the automotive industry's and other key clients' expectations for zero-CO2 products as a driving force behind this transition. Scholz stressed that halting the support for green steel initiatives would undermine the interests of steel manufacturers across Germany. Dennis Grimm, the head of Thyssenkrupp's steel division, reinforced the urgency for political backing, regardless of the election outcomes, due to the integral role of steel production in Germany's industrial framework. Grimm called for measures such as competitive energy pricing, effective European trade protection, and strategies to prevent carbon leakage via a robust Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He also advocated for incentives promoting the use of sustainable raw materials. \"Green steel is the business model of the future,\" Grimm stated, although he acknowledged challenges like the sluggish expansion of European hydrogen infrastructure and the scarcity of affordable hydrogen. He urged political leaders to address these issues to meet ambitious goals. Germany's ongoing discourse on green steel also involves political figures like Friedrich Merz of the CDU, who advocates for renewable energy and hydrogen technologies as vital to eco-friendly steel manufacturing. Merz has expressed hesitations about the swift transition of steel mills to hydrogen-based fuel, citing the comparative costs of green steel to traditional methods.
