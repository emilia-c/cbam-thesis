And Secondly, in case CBAM is not withdrawn, will India successfully neutralize it with its own carbon tax? In addition to describing the transitional methodology for calculating embedded emissions produced throughout the production process of CBAM items, the Implementing Regulation also outlines the transitory reporting requirements for EU importers of “CBAM goods”. Trader reporting of the emissions included in their imported goods covered by the mechanism will be the only requirement during the CBAM's transitional period. No compensatory payments will be required. This will provide businesses ample time to plan predictably and to enable the definitive approach to be modified by 2026. Enterprises in the EU that import items covered by CBAM will have to purchase certificates as of January 1, 2026. Based on the premise that payment of a fee for the embedded carbon emissions by overseas producers generated in the production of specific goods imported into the EU does not compromise the EU's primary climate objective, the CBAM will guarantee that the carbon price of imports is equal to the carbon price of domestic production. preventing carbon leakage between products made in and outside of the EU. It is expected that CBAM will have a significant financial impact. For example, importers from the EU are expected to face increased costs of almost €2 billion annually when the carbon price in the EU approaches €100 per tonne by 2030, up from the current price of less than €82 per tonne. According to these estimates, the price of iron and steel imported by the EU from India might rise by more than 30% by 2032, lowering the cost of EU goods and eliminating the need for Indian suppliers to compete. Additionally, inflationary pressures may eventually be felt more broadly because it is predicted that the scope of CBAM will grow to encompass additional products in the future. By imposing a carbon border tax, the European Union hopes to transfer some of the costs of their environmental reform to foreign producers. Although it may be difficult to predict the precise outcomes and the extent of global trade distortion at this point, the impact on the Asia-Pacific region is undeniable. While border protection would be implemented in 2026, subsidies would be removed from 2025 to 2035. Without a doubt, the implementation of a border tax on carbon emissions without a corresponding phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies is a preventable swindle. These industries are dominated by exporters from the Asia Pacific area, and they are all vulnerable to increased trade costs when attempting to access the EU market or adverse displacement effects in third-country markets if exports are redirected away from Europe. This just serves to confirm that CBAM is opportunistic protectionism targeted at Europeans. Many see the proposed EU CBAM as protectionist, with the potential to hurt small Indian steel and cement enterprises as well as other countries that export CBAM commodities. Discord is inevitable given the challenges associated with estimating the carbon emissions from taxable imports, especially those that are a part of complex supply networks, and figuring out how much of these emissions have already been locally taxed by other governments. What is even more difficult is following the World Trade Organization (WTO) charter and without favouring any one country over another. Under duress, including the possibility of trade sanctions, few nations will wish to reform their environmental laws as they have to sustain their domestic development goals as WTO does enable actions essential to protect human, animal, and plant life, further it arrogates against the Westphalian principles. Rather, it is widely acknowledged that inadequacies in environmental policy ought to be addressed at their source instead through proxies. The Japan Business Council in Europe (JBCE) highlighted that CBAM must abide by WTO regulations. The European Union should prioritise environmental policy over-pressure that affects commerce by decreasing fossil fuel subsidies and increasing public investment in green technology. If the carbon content of the items determines how CBAM imports from WTO members are treated differently, this could be against the most favoured-nation standard. A unfavourable trading stance against the MFN principle, which is a cornerstone and hallmark of many free trade agreements, may arise from developing countries' limited ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example, which will lead to higher adjustment carbon price at the border. The principle of non-discrimination, however, poses two important considerations in the context of commerce and CBAM: will the products in question be \"like\" products? And if it is determined that two products are \"like\" the question of whether domestically produced or imported goods are treated at par remains. In response to the first query, WTO jurisprudence, for instance, in WTO Dispute Appellate Body Report on Japan – Alcoholic Beverages, I.T.L.R. vol 1, iss. 2 at 242 (July 11, 1996), has demonstrated that a case-by-case analysis of resemblance between two items is necessary. In order to respond to the second query, CBAM is a different tool meant to support EU Emission Trading System (ETS). EU claims that the EU ETS is not a protectionist measure but it is rebutted as EU already maintains a distinction between different industries inside the EU, and between EU \"products\" and imported items. Can EU nations uphold the common but differentiated duties portion of the Paris Agreement while disregarding the Net Zero aspect? This is another unsolved question. It is an admitted fact that developed countries have exploited the environment for far longer and in fact, continue to do so, hence, this begs the question that simultaneous application of CBAM on developed, developing, and under- developed nations alike is in stark contravention of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities? The prospect of CBAM withstanding the test of common but differentiated responsibilities is simply inconceivable. It must not be forgotten that the true essence of the Paris Agreement is in the developed nations working in tandem with the developing and exporting countries instead of being priggish and castigating them. With this carbon conundrum becoming a reality, two things remain to be seen- Firstly, will CBAM act as a “death knell” for EUs own manufacturing sector? And Secondly, in case CBAM is not withdrawn, will India successfully neutralize it with its own carbon tax? [This piece has been authored by Ramisha Jain, Disputes Practitioner.
