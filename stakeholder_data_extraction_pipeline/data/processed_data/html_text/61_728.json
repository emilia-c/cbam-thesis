She is primarily concerned with how emissions trading systems work, because she is convinced that carbon markets are a cornerstone of international climate policy, and can help achieve climate neutrality. “Carbon markets not only provide incentives for efficient decarbonisation, they also enable countries to work together on climate policy. With my work I can push these processes forward.”",
