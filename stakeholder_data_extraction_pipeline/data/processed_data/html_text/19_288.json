Europe’s metal and manufacturing sectors face a new compliance requirement: the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU’s policy for taxing supply chain carbon emissions. Starting in July 2024, both importers and suppliers of CBAM goods must provide an overview of their emissions, adhering to specific reporting standards. “CBAM is impossible!”  Well, not any more.
