Cazes. “The revised Directive asks industry to intensify investments while its capacity is impacted by both high energy and ever-increasing carbon costs”. The introduction of a Carbon Boarder Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) brings new uncertainty as its implementation and consequences are hard to foresee. “Glass for Europe is willing to engage with EU authorities if an assessment of a possible extension to the flat glass industry is launched,” concluded B. Cazes. Listen to Bertrand Cazes on the revised EU ETS and the CBAM.",
