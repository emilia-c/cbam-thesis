Download meetings The list below covers meetings with Commissioners/Cabinet members/Directors-general (high-level) Commission meetings published December 2014 to December 2024, and the meetings of Commissioners/Cabinet members/Directors-general and officials holding \"management functions\" in the Commission published since 1 January 2025. Other lobby meetings with lower-level staff may well have taken place, but the Commission doesn't proactively publish information about these meetings. All information below comes from the Commission and not from the registrant. 1 July 2024: We have noted that some meetings are appearing in duplicate, ie. some meetings seem to be listed twice. This seems to be because the Commission changes some element of a meeting data after the meeting has first been listed, which causes LobbyFacts to register it as a new meeting. We are investigating further. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Date 17 Mar 2025 Location Brussels Subject European Commission’s CSRD and Taxonomy omnibus simplification proposals.
