As part of the European Green Deal and Europe's recovery plan, one of the main objectives of the measure is to mitigate carbon leakage and help the EU reach its objective of climate neutrality by 2050. AmCham EU and its member companies have the required expertise to contribute to the policy debate and we welcome opportunities to engage in the discussion on the best possible policies to encourage low emission production and to support a fair and level playing field. Our response details our perspectives on the following: objectives of CBAM; the design of the mechanism; Scope; WTO compatibility; potential exemptions and the calculation of carbon content of products.
