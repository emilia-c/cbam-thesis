Concrete measures must now follow and there is no time to lose. There is a lot to be done: industry in Europe needs quick and courageous action and measurable results.” \"Companies are eagerly awaiting the promised relief from EU policymakers. In addition to the announced simplifications for sustainability reporting, corporate sustainability due diligence and the taxonomy, the bureaucracy associated with the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) urgently needs to be streamlined.” “Companies also need more transparency regarding the European Commission's other planned initiatives to reduce bureaucracy. The machinery equipment industry is willing to intensify the dialogue with decision-makers and make specific proposals for the rapid and effective relief of industrial SMEs.” Agenda Wed, 06/18/2025 - 02:00    Wed, 05/14/2025 - 11:30    Tue, 05/13/2025 - 14:00    Mon, 04/28/2025 - 02:00    Tue, 04/15/2025 - 13:00    Thu, 04/10/2025 - 11:30    Wed, 04/09/2025 - 20:30    Jobs European Association of Public Banks (EAPB)    CLERENS    Brussels International Center for Research    Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe    EVENFLOW SRL    Centre for Future Generations vzw    European Cyclists’ Federation    European Banking Federation (EBF)    ZVEI e.V. – Verband der Elektro- und Digitalindustrie",
