    "text": "Sandbag is a non-profit climate change think tank that uses data analysis and targeted advocacy campaigns to improve EU climate policies Our Work Carbon Pricing Our research on the EU ETS and emission allowances, advocating for efficient carbon pricing mechanisms and concrete ways to drive emission reductions. Industry CBAM Supporting a strong CBAM to phase out the allocation of free emission allowances, address carbon leakage, and accelerate global climate action. Climate Financing Our analysis of EU funding initiatives driving climate innovation and industrial decarbonisation. Ensuring revenues from the EU ETS and CBAM are well spent. Data Tools Our data visualisation and simulation tools, allowing EU policymakers to gain unique insights and implement informed climate policies.
