    "text": "Qatargas today (14 March) announced the signing of a side agreement to the existing sale and purchase agreement with Polish Oil and Gas Company (PGNiG). Under the terms of the agreement, Qatargas will increase the volume of liquefied natural gas (LNG) currently supplied to PGNiG to two million tonnes per annum. The new agreement will come into effect on 1 January 2018 and will run until June 2034. Commenting on the new deal, Qatargas chief executive officer Khalid Bin Khalifa Al-Thani said: “Qatargas looks forward to the next phase in our long-term relationship with PGNiG, and to the prospect of building an even stronger relationship with PGNiG as we increase our deliveries of LNG to Poland.” PGNiG chief executive officer and president of the management board Piotr Woźniak said: “PGNiG is firmly committed to expanding its LNG portfolio and our presence in the global LNG market. I’m very pleased that Qatargas and PGNiG have been able to achieve an agreement which contributes to the realisation of the long-term goals of both companies and supports the implementation of our strategy to diversify natural gas supplies to Central and Eastern Europe.” The LNG will be supplied from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (Qatargas 3), a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, and Mitsui & Co Ltd, and will be delivered on board Q-Flex LNG vessels to the President Lech Kaczynski LNG Terminal in Swinoujscie, Poland. © 2024 Riviera Maritime Media Ltd.",
