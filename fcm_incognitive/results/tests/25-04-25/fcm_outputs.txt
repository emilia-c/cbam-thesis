IDEAS 
- run QA model again? so then can have longer causal chains (i guess better to run it without the original levers)
- and get those from the first remapped one? 
so then the chain could be x - DPP - digitalization ? 

then for this one you could be decisive with trimming based on confidence level (look at it) 
how can I make it so I have less concepts in my FCM map? where should i trim?

** how to future proof for regulation, the key for green regulation is investing in digitalisation/traceability ** 
- want to get this sort of result, how possible?
