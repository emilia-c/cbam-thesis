policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100

systems and policies to help absorb billions of tonnes of co every year. according to nasim pour, director of carbon removal and market innovation at the world economic forum in the report \' carbon

slowly than expected in the past, it has gained considerable momentum in recent years. today, there are more than 700 projects at various stages of development across the ccus value chain. in 2023, the total co capture capacity announced for 2030 grew by 35 %, and storage capacity by 70 %. with neutrality as a target, the eu indicates that at least 50 mt of storage capacity will be needed by 2050. this capacity is expected to increase to 280 mt by 2040 and 450 mt by 2050. in this respect, the amount of co captured and stored remains below what is needed to meet climate goals. in the net zero emissions scenario for 2050, it is estimated that around 1 billion tonnes (1 gt) of co would need to be captured and stored per year. ccus projects currently in operation cover only 40 % of this target in terms of capture and 60 % in terms of storage. | to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, about 1 gt of co per year would need to be captured and stored. the european union has identified ccus

alloy. hybrit, a consortium consisting of vattenfall, steel producer ssab and miner lkab, produced the first ever fossil fuel free steel using green hydrogen. hybrit ' s aspiration is not unique. driven by the steel zero initiative, set up in 2020 by the climate group to drive action to decarbonise the sector, key industry stakeholders have made a flurry of commitments and investments to reach this milestone by 2050. industry momentum is expected to continue in 2022 with the first industrial pilot projects expected by the middle of the decade. around 71 per cent of steel produced today comes from an iron ore based method. this typically uses a blast furnace at temperatures of around 1,500c in which carbon, usually coal, is used to remove oxygen and impurities from the ore to make pig iron. the latter is then turned into steel via a basic oxygen furnace whereby oxygen is blown onto the liquid iron to burn unwanted elements. the other 29 per cent is made using scrap and electric arc furnaces (eaf), which use an electrical current to melt scrap steel. this is on average 25 per cent less carbon intensive than the other method. steel producers are considering several ways to decarbonise these processes. at the hybrit pilot plant in lule, sweden, engineers opted to replace the blast furnace process with a ' direct reduction ' that uses hydrogen made from water and renewable electricity to reduce iron ore pellets manufactured by llkb without fossil fuels to sponge iron, which is then turned into steel. the temperature needed for the reduction process is much lower than in the blast furnace and produces only water vapor as a by product, removing 90 per cent of co2 emissions. the technique is powered by energy from the national grid, which in sweden is largely fossil free, consisting mostly of hydro and wind power. ssab hope to turn their research into a full scale pilot plant by 2026. newcomer h2 green steel (h2gs), which is also based in sweden

border tax : much pain, little gain georg zachmann and ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu climate policy. the eu should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in

international cooperation and existing trading regimes, any new established mechanism, e. g. a carbon border adjustment mechanism, should be carefully considered. necessary discussions to define such a system should be based on a holistic and carefully performed impact assessment. a complete package must focus on these main criteria : the vda supports a multilateral, rule based framework for international trade and investment. all potential measures being adapted to avoid carbon and investment leakage have to ensure compliance with wto rules and eu \' s international trade agreements. potential effects on the international trading system must be considered. this includes, for example, negative counter reactions by affected states, regardless of whether the eu has de jure found a wto compliant measure. any form of discrimination or unilateral preference must be prevented. furthermore, it has to be considered that according to the concept of the european commission exports from the eu would not be unburdened from higher costs due to eu climate policies. this has a negative impact on competitiveness of european industries. a convincing concept of how a new mechanism-for instance a carbon border adjustment mechanism-could be implemented in practice is not finally developed yet. even the recording and verification of the co2 content of a product ("" product carbon footprints "") is yet difficult to calculate for many products. to what extent a concept would be effectively replacing national compensation measures, such as free certificates under the european

european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy

cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers

and ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu

purchase all of the necessary eu ets allowances on the market to remain globally competitive, as the remaining allowances are freely allocated to them. the cbam plans to gradually replace free allowances with a price on the carbon emissions embedded in imports. following a transitionalprimarily monitoring phase, this price on embedded emissions will be gradually introduced from 2026 on the imports of certain products. while the cbam can mitigate carbon leakage, production declines in greenhouse gas intensive industries as a result of limiting free allowances, and rising carbon prices, it cannot compensate for them completely. in particular, the cbam does not provide sufficient protection for exporters to non eu coun-tries. it is crucial that the cbam does not lead to trade con-flicts that would make multilateral cooperation more difficult. international cooperation is indispensable, as it is the only way to reduce global emissions. the european union (eu) has set a goal

of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german

other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free

environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic

to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a

the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only to rise by 95 tons in country', 'reference': '943', 'full_answer': 'the intuition behind

be reduced. the pace of current decarbonization efforts will be aided by the introduction of new low-and zero carbon production technologies driven by government policies. in many cases, products from these sectors are exchanged on highly competitive international markets, raising concerns that domestic decarbonization policies could result in lost competitive advantage vis a vis nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s preexisting approach to decarbonizing the industrial sector. another approach, which may be more appropriate for the current state of global climate policy, is to design an industrial decarbonization policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives to reduce emissions down to the performance metric, while offering additional advantages. by starting

by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase

such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a,

what are the reactions from developing countries ? are other countries introducing their own mechanisms ? what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and

global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions for both domestic consumption and production. an export rebate would necessitate a decision to create a level playing field for all european exporters on the international market or support low carbon european exports only. import adjustments, on the contrary, could potentially be designed wto compatible. if a bca is to be implemented, the issue of how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the eu needs to be addressed. this could be resolved by choosing default values for a sectorial average. default values avoid trade discrimination but would not be fully accurate. a leakage risk remains. full calculations can avoid leakage but are administratively very difficult. default values would help in operating a bca, if a bca is applied to only a few sectors, given that data on production technologies across the eu exist. third party certification could be used by producers abroad that perform better than the eu average. a clear trade off exists regarding the scope of a bca. if it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. however, a broad scope results in high administrative burden and methodological clarity. the different treatment of products with a carbon intensity higher than the eu ' s average could be at odds

carbon border adjustment mechanism, or cbam, extends the reach of the eu ets to cover imports of certain products entering the european economic area. the cbam replaces free allocation as the primary tool to protect trade exposed sectors against carbon leakage. according to the provisional agreement reached by the council and the european parliament, the initial 3 year pilot phase of cbam requires eu importers to report the greenhouse gases released during production (direct and indirect) of aluminium, cement, iron and steel, fertilizer, hydrogen, as well as electricity produced outside of the eu. the provisional agreement was preceded by long discussions on the scope and coverage of the mechanism. the goal is to extend the coverage of the mechanism to also include further commodities subject to carbon leakage, such as organic chemicals and polymers (plastics), as well as eventually all goods covered by the eu ets. once the cbam enters into force in 2027, importers will need to acquire and surrender certificates corresponding to the greenhouse gases associated with imports from outside of the eu. the cbam was introduced to promote a level playing field in terms of the regulatory burden of climate policies between producers of similar products within the eu and outside of it. in many cases its introduction will reduce the competitiveness of carbon intensive products manufactured outside of the region. many of the immediate considerations of the cbam ' s potential impact center around countries who are key exporters of the affected products to the eu and therefore

several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonization as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal

foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu. building on the clean transition dialogueon steel in march 2024 and follow up input, which helped form a collective understanding of the challenges, the ambition is now to work together to craft a dedicated steel and metals action plan, to be launched in spring of this year.

the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in

solutions without regret. a carbon border adjustment would also induce greater mitigation efforts by indirectly incentivizing investments in carbon clean products in third countries and allowing the spread of meaningful carbon pricing. the design of a carbon border adjustment requires careful considerations there are several options for implementing a carbon border adjustment and these are not

transitory reporting requirements for eu importers of "" cbam goods "". during the transitional period of the cbam, traders will simply be required to report on the emissions included in their imported goods covered by the mechanism, without making any compensatory payments. this will allow for the definitive approach to be adjusted by 2026 while also giving businesses enough time to plan in a predictable way. on january 1,2026, eu businesses importing goods into the eu covered by cbam will need to buy certificates. the cbam will ensure that the carbon price of imports is equal to the carbon price of domestic production based on the premise that eu \' s primary climate objective is not compromised by payment of a fee for the embedded carbon emissions by overseas producers generated in the production of specific goods imported into the eu. thereby, avoiding carbon leakage between eu and non eu goods. cbam is anticipated to have a large financial impact. for instance, it has been estimated that by 2030, when the carbon price in the eu is anticipated to approach 100 per tonne, from the current price of under 82 per tonne, importers from the eu will incur higher expenditures of around 2 billion per year. these calculations suggest that by 2032, the cost of iron and steel imported by the eu from india could increase by more than 30 % making eu products less expensive leaving

41am the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains how the cbam works and the impact on climate policies it is already having in the eu and around the world, as nations such as the uk and the us consider implementing cbams and related policies of their own. what is a carbon border adjustment

countries introducing their own mechanisms ? what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its

sustainable and efficient operations imagine your company making profits and contributing to a better environment. the circular supply chain makes this possible by radically changing how we produce and use products. it is a system where waste is a thing of the past and resources are utilized optimally. from reuse to recycling, this model offers enormous benefits for both the environment and business results. let ' s see how this works. what is a circular supply chain ? in a circular supply chain, products, components, and materials are continuously reused in a closed loop approach. think of a company that takes back used products, refurbishes them, and resells them instead of discarding them. this extends the product ' s lifespan, reduces the need for new raw materials, and minimizes environmental impact. an example is philips, which takes back old medical equipment, refurbishes it, and reintroduces it to the market circular vs. closed loop supply chain although ' circular ' and ' closed loop ' are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference. a closed loop supply chain focuses on recycling materials within the chain to minimize waste. circular goes further and encompasses the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to end of life. imagine a thrift store versus a product designer who considers reuse and recycling from the start. linear supply chain the opposite of a circular supply chain is a linear supply chain. the raw materials are sourced, produced, used, and discarded. while most companies currently operate their supply chain as a linear flow of goods, recycling companies and second hand dealers and shops take their linear products and try to reuse them. it is crucial to learn that having a linear organization does not mean that your product is also used linearly. creating a circular supply chain creating it requires a holistic approach that involves all stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. the process involves four key steps : design for sustainability : the first step is to design products with sustainability in mind, considering the entire product lifecycle and its environmental impact. optimize resource utilization : the next step is to optimize resource utilization by reducing waste and maximizing renewable sources. implement reverse logistics : the third step is reverse logistics, where products are collected and returned to the supply chain for refurbishment, remanufacturing, or recycling. foster collaboration : finally, creating a circular supply chain

the temperature objectives under the paris agreement will require disruptive system innovations in all sectors of the global economy. to make the required transition a success, we will need strong governance frameworks that combine long term strategic planning complemented with compatible short-and mid term policy development. this will allow countries to achieve their climate neutrality objectives in a smart and cost effective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climate neutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver emissions reductions remains in line with keeping temperature increases in line with the goals of the paris agreement. with the launch of the european green deal and the eu ' s 2050 climate neutrality target, the eu is revising the main corpus of its climate regulations. the new intermediary 2030 target of at least 55 % means that eu and national targets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and emission reductions need to be ramped up and achieve transformative change during the next decade. while the targets and regulations may be set at eu level, a lot of the heavy lifting of the european green deal will have to be done at nationally. behind the 2030 and 2050 targets are very diverse member states facing different challenges to decarbonise and provide a just transition for their citizens.

to abate, "" greenhouse gas intensive industrial sectors (steel, aluminum, cement, and chemicals) must be reduced. the pace of current decarbonization efforts will be aided by the introduction of new low-and zero carbon production technologies driven by government policies. in many cases, products from these sectors are exchanged on highly competitive international markets, raising concerns that domestic decarbonization policies could result in lost competitive advantage vis a vis nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s preexisting approach to decarbonizing the industrial sector. another approach, which may be more appropriate for the current state of global climate policy, is to design an industrial decarbonization policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives to reduce emissions down to the performance metric, while offering additional advantages. by starting with a performance metric close to current us industrial performance, it would primarily affect those trading partners with higher emissions and not us producers. by assessing the fee only on emissions above the performance metric', 'reference': '1474', 'full_answer': 'the pace of current

markets, raising concerns that domestic decarbonization policies could result in lost competitive advantage vis a vis nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s preexisting approach to decarbonizing the industrial sector. another approach, which may be more appropriate for the current state of global climate policy, is to design an industrial decarbonization policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives to reduce emissions down to the performance metric, while offering additional advantages. by starting with a performance metric close to current us industrial

currently launching significant decarbonization investments. these large scale projects require regulatory certainty and policy support to happen. ensuring a level playing field on carbon through cbam is an essential pillar to establish a business case for these investments. it is therefore crucial that the operational phase of cbam starts in 2026, as agreed by the eu institutions. cembureau agrees that some targeted improvements could be brought to cbam, in particular to minimise the risks of fraud and circumvention, find a solution for exports, and simplify the mechanism where possible. these points are important and deserve a strong focus from policymakers. however, a two year delay in cbam implementation would only cause major risks for ongoing eu decarbonization investments, and for the broader competitiveness of the cement sector, which has been confronted with rising imports in recent years. furthermore, cembureau would like to point out that, unlike the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd) and the corporate sustainability due diligence directive (csddd) which are both mentioned in the epp statement alongside cbam cbam does not add bureaucratic constraints on european producers. on the contrary, cbam consists in mirroring the requirements of the eu emission trading scheme, to which all european producers of cbam goods are subject today, to ensure a level

cbam is a system that imposes a carbon levy on imported goods, equivalent to the one applied to goods produced within the euand norway. this means imports with high carbon content will no longer benefit from unfair competitive advantages compared to products subject to stricter climate regulations. for norway, cbam will help protect domestic businesses from competition originating in countries with less stringent climate policies. which goods and industries are covered by cbam ?

competition policy to support the unprecedented industrial transformation required to achieve the green deal. this comprehensive program challenges the eu ' s sustainable development. if the eu wants to lead in the process of industrial transformation, massive investments from eu industry are required that global competitors do not need to make. without an adaption of the competition policy framework, eu industrial competitiveness is at risk. cefic supports the overall direction taken by the green deal and the eu going climate neutral by 2050. the required industrial transformation will imply massive investments : a dechema analysis shows an investment requirement of 27bn per year between now and 2050. this will only be possible if private investment is enabled (amongst other things, by ensuring globally competitive conditions for industry in europe), and by ensuring sufficient public sector support is available. eu competition policy should be aligned with the green deal objectives and enable this massive transformation. it needs to balance newly market conditions as well as maintaining competition in the eu single market with the demands of industrial transformation in the pursuit of the environmental goals of the green deal. innovation wil be key for the success of the transformation. competition policy needs to aim at supporting innovation via competition and cooperation at the same time. the eu chemical industry is a driving player and already supplies the homegrown essentials for going clean, circular, digitalized and climate neutral. for the chemical industry, the eu needs to ensure global competitiveness, given that global action on climate change remains fragmented, whilst maintaining security of supply at the same time. this response constitutes a preliminary contribution to the commission ' s questions regarding the competition policy framework and provides a high level overview of the ways in which competition policy could

national or regional climate regulations. in order to preserve international competitiveness, international cooperation and existing trading regimes, any new established mechanism, e. g. a carbon border adjustment mechanism, should be carefully considered. necessary discussions to define such a system should be based on a holistic and carefully performed impact assessment. a complete package must focus on these main criteria : the vda supports a multilateral, rule based framework for international trade and investment. all potential measures being adapted to avoid carbon and investment leakage have to ensure compliance with wto rules and eu \' s international trade agreements. potential effects on the international trading system must be considered. this includes, for example, negative counter reactions by affected states, regardless of whether the eu has de jure found a wto compliant measure. any form of discrimination or unilateral preference must be prevented. furthermore, it has to be considered that according to the concept of the european commission exports from the eu would not be unburdened from higher costs due to eu climate policies. this has a negative impact on competitiveness of european industries. a convincing concept of how a new mechanism-for instance a carbon border adjustment mechanism-could be implemented in practice is not finally developed yet. even the recording and verification of the co2 content of a product ("" product carbon footprints "") is yet difficult to calculate for many products. to what extent a concept would be

that will allow for a competitive transformation of the industry. cement and concrete are critical for a sustainable built environment of tomorrow, ranging from residential housing, business premises and factories to infrastructure and low carbon energy assets. along its manufacturing and downstream value chain, the cement industry is an indispensable contributor to making the european union achieve its climate targets. our path to decarbonization has been set in the cembureau net zero roadmap, recently updated in may 2024. the european cement industry ' s technology leadership has allowed to accelerate the deployment of new projects and processes along the cement and concrete value chain (see here our map of innovation projects). these projects, currently being deployed across the 200 cement plants across the european union and firmly embedded in local communities, will allow the cement industry to deliver low carbon products to market. the transformation of the cement industry, one of the four hard to abate sectors, requires significant upfront capital and operational costs. confronted with long investment cycles, our sector urgently needs the right set of enablers providing political and regulatory certainty for these investments to happen. we expect the clean industrial deal to reflect the sense of urgency in the following areas cbam cbam should be fully implemented on 1 * january 2026, as agreed by the eu institutions ; any suggestion to delay risks to derail investment decisions. the simplification of cbam rules should not come at the expense of its watertightness and effectiveness. the core objective of cbam must remain to secure the level playing field for investments in europe. an export solution needs to be elaborated based on effective solutions, such as export adjustment or continued free allowances for exported goods through the application of the destination principle which merits more in-depth analysis and discussion as to its

objective by 2050. a successful implementation will require ambition across the economy, including an ambitious industrial policy creating the enabling framework for the transformation of europe \' s industrial base. policies also need to be backed up with a sectorial strategy providing more details on how the commission expects different sectors of the whole economy (industry, power, buildings, transport, agriculture) to contribute to the overall objectives until 2030 and beyond. this sectorial strategy should also include regular check points regarding progress on the enabling conditions

for 55 \' package and supports strong action on climate change, in line with the scientific advice provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc). the \' fit for 55 \' package is a crucial step towards the eu climate neutrality objective by 2050. a successful implementation will require ambition across the economy, including an ambitious industrial policy creating the enabling framework for the transformation of europe \' s industrial base. policies also need to be backed up with a sectorial strategy providing more details on how the commission expects different sectors of the whole economy (industry, power, buildings, transport, agriculture) to contribute to the overall objectives until 2030 and beyond. this sectorial strategy should also include regular check points regarding progress on the enabling conditions for the transition of each sector. for the chemical industry, this includes the availability of competitively priced renewable and low carbon energy, support for the deployment of breakthrough technologies, availability of public and private finance and robust carbon leakage protection. we therefore want to ensure that the fit for 55 package will be a success for eu industry and society at large, recognising it as a key enabler of the transition to a climate neutral europe while safeguarding the eu \' s competitiveness and strengthen europe \' s leading role in tackling climate change. to this end, we highlight in this paper a number of recommendations focusing on the following legislative files : effort sharing regulation (esr) : avoiding a transfer of responsibility from member states to industry emissions trading scheme (ets) : carbon leakage protection must be improved, at a time when eu chemical companies will have to invest massively into their transformation, in a context of growing asymmetry in carbon pricing between europe and the rest of the world land use, land use change and forestry (lulucf) : carbon sinks as an

trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu \' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu \' s total emissions, so their contribution is

this puts (supra -) national industrial decarbonization efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie anti foreign subsidy) laws and

financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonization at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the cross border negative economic impacts of otherwise net global welfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net global welfare

introduction environmental subsidies are typically conceptualised as public spending (including governmental revenue foregone and in kind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the net zero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluter pays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition to a green economy and more than

of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s preexisting approach to decarbonizing the industrial sector. another approach, which may be more appropriate for the current state of global climate policy, is to design an industrial decarbonization policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives to reduce emissions down to the

believe that strengthening of climate actions by reducing carbon leakage is the main goal since the european green deal aims to achieve the climate targets of the paris agreement. we also see other important objectives, including the avoidance of social and economic harms, the limitation of legal and political risks, the minimisation of the administrative complexity and costs of avoiding carbon leakage. various trade offs and challenges exist for the design options of a bca or its alternative. a bca could target imports only, or both exports and imports. it could be added to existing or future free allocation or become a stand alone anti leakage measure for sectors at risk. export rebates or (even more so) a combination of free allowances with export rebates could raise red flags, given that they do not serve climate protection and could qualify as prohibited subsidies under wto rules. if there is no global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions for both domestic consumption and production. an export rebate would necessitate a decision to create a level playing field for all european exporters on the international market or support low carbon european exports only. import adjustments, on the contrary, could potentially be designed wto compatible. if a bca is to be implemented, the issue of how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the eu needs to be addressed. this could be resolved by choosing default values for a sectorial average. default values avoid trade discrimination but would not be fully accurate. a leakage risk remains. full calculations can avoid leakage but are administratively very difficult. default values would help in operating a bca, if a bca is applied to only a few sectors, given that data on production technologies across the eu exist. third party certification could be used by producers abroad that perform better than the eu average. a clear trade off exists regarding the scope of a bca. if it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. however, a broad scope results in high administrative burden and methodological clarity. the different treatment of products with a carbon intensity higher than the eu ' s average could be at odds with the wto law and the national treatment principle. it will depend on the

product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating

climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 %

'leakage in climate policy discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero

to the eu. this is why the currently proposed unilateral and sector specific cbam (carbon border adjustment mechanism) raises serious concerns within the association. the cbam is designed specifically to fight carbon leakage. carbon leakage is defined as a situation where, due to growing environmental costs, such as eu ets costs, eu businesses (1) loose eu and export markets in favor of cheaper carbon intensive products, and (2) move production / investments to countries with lower or no emission reduction ambition and respective costs. esteemed independent economists identify fundamental issues which completely remove the cbam from the declared eu climate agenda and even the levelling playing field agenda, the latter being the main historical driver for the cbam. in particular, economists credibly argue that carbon leakage is a far fetched, if not a non existent, issue because growing ets costs are just a minor factor for businesses to move abroad. the economists further identify such serious issues as carbon absorption, source shifting and market distorting signals due to promotion of cost saving replacement of (1) imports of semi finished goods or raw materials, such as steel slabs or billets for re rolling / processing in the eu, with more value added finished goods, and (2) more expensive cbam covered products with competing products of a cbam non covered sector with the same or even higher carbon footprint. the latter may have devastating effects on certain eu sectors and sub sectors of economy, particularly downstream manufacturers. the above issues strongly indicate that the currently proposed cbam does not serve its very purpose because it cannot fight carbon leakage, even if such phenomenon existed to the extent it is presented by some

environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face

policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the

goods at high risk of carbon leakage : iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity generation. until 2026, the focus is on gathering and reporting the data required for assessing the carbon values of imported products. after this transitional period, importers of cbam goods must pay a fee, proportional to the carbon costs faced by domestic production. this gradual approach, focused mainly on carbon values, is intended to smooth the roll out and to facilitate dialogue with countries impacted by this measure. at the european level, the introduction of cbam will lead to the withdrawal of free carbon allowances for sectors vulnerable to carbon leakage. after 2030, the scope of the covered sectors will be expanded further. this betd side event hosted by the international network of the energy transition think tanks (inettt) had the form of a dialogue between eu and non eu countries. it cross checked the effects of cbam as intended by the eu (germany, poland) against the impacts expected in brazil, mexico, indonesia, trkiye and china on socioeconomic, political, and geopolitical levels. the event aimed to foster ideas on how to mitigate any potential negative

the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 % simply cannot source their imported cbam goods from eu suppliers many handle shipments with hundreds of different skus most deal with"", 'reference': '872', 'full_answer': 'cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7444106340408325}, {'answer': 'the mechanism of carbon adjustment of imports has already been dubbed "" bureaucratic madness ""', 'confidence': np.float32(0.11884961), 'start': np.int64(26), 'end': np.int64(41), 'context': 'european business has made a number of comments on the reporting under the cba. in particular, the mechanism of carbon adjustment of imports has already been dubbed "" bureaucratic madness "" in the eu. this was reported by euractiv. the transitional period, which is currently underway in the process of implementing the world \' s first climate import duty, only provides for the collection of data without paying a duty on carbon emissions associated with the production of goods outside the european union. but even at this stage, the employees of european companies responsible for submitting cbam reports have questions, the answers to which they are trying to find out at technical briefings organized by the european commission \' s tax department. the three most important questions are what, who, and where to file. what ?

and customs department swedish comments on the inception impact assessment of a carbon border adjustment mechanism the swedish government appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), within the framework of the inception impact assessment. the issue of a cbam is complex and closely linked to several different policy areas. it is therefore essential with transparency and an open dialogue with member states and other relevant stakeholders as well as engaging broadly with relevant expert bodies throughout the further design process of the relevant measures. the swedish government supports the long term objective of climate neutrality in the eu and its member states by 2050 and believes that the eu ' s 2030 climate target should be increased to at least 55 % and be in line with the 1. 5 degree objective of the paris agreement. these measures are a prerequisite to maintain the eu ' s global leadership in the fight against climate change and to seize the economic benefits of the transition. while increasing the eu climate ambition, it is essential that the risk of carbon leakage is properly addressed. sweden has high climate ambitions and is in favor of eventually phasing out the free allocation in the eu ets as well as the compensation scheme for increases in electricity prices indirectly resulting from costs due to the eu ets. as a possibly more effective alternative to current measures that serve to safeguard against leakage, a properly designed cbam can enable the eu to keep its leading role in fighting climate change in a global context lacking equivalent climate action from other major economies. the impact assessment should analyze carefully how a phasing out of the current carbon leakage measures could be synchronized with an introduction of a cbam. the swedish government therefore welcomes a thorough analysis of the legal and practical feasibility of introducing such a cbam as an effective tool to avoid carbon leakage. the analysis needs, among other things, to consider implications on trade and competitiveness, including compatibility with wto tules. such an analysis will provide guidance to which type of policy measures that are best suited when designing a cbam. the swedish government agrees with the commission that the main objective of a cbam needs to be fighting climate change by avoiding carbon leakage. sweden has a long tradition of advocating the necessity of a well-functioning global free trade. the need for a cbam can only remain as long as differences

(ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the

and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate

trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains how the cbam works and the impact on climate policies it is already having in the eu and around the world, as nations such as the uk and the us consider implementing cbams and related policies of their own. what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? why was the cbam introduced in the eu ? how will the eu \' s cbam work ? how is the mechanism expected to cut emissions ? what are the reactions from developing countries ? are other countries introducing their own mechanisms ? what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the border, to steel imported from overseas.', 'reference': '937', 'full_answer': 'it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the

limiting global emissions. however, another aspect needs to be considered, which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness and carbon leakage. addressing competitiveness should ensure that products that have a lower carbon intensity are not disadvantaged in the domestic as well as international markets, resulting in higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with asymmetrical climate change policies. border carbon adjustments (bcas) seek to alleviate the negative effects of uneven (asymmetrical) climate policies and may include imports and / or exempt exports. ensuring that both these aspects are included in the examination is critical for the effectiveness and credibility of any approach being adopted. in the same train of thought, it is important that both direct and indirect emissions are included in the examination that the european commission is proposing. bcas have three main objectives :-prevent leakage of carbon emissions to jurisdictions with weaker policies ;-create a level playing field in competitive markets ;-incentivise trade

final vote on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) proposal. this will mark the last opportunity for the parliament and the council of the eu to fine tune the mechanism and ensure its ultimate objectives can be fulfilled. as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to

purchase all of the necessary eu ets allowances on the market to remain globally competitive, as the remaining allowances are freely allocated to them. the cbam plans to gradually replace free allowances with a price on the carbon emissions embedded in imports. following a transitionalprimarily monitoring phase, this price on embedded emissions will be gradually introduced from 2026 on the imports of certain products. while the cbam can mitigate carbon leakage, production declines in greenhouse gas intensive industries as a result of limiting free allowances, and rising carbon prices, it cannot compensate for them completely. in particular, the cbam does not provide sufficient protection for exporters to non eu coun-tries. it is crucial that the cbam does not lead to trade con-flicts that would make multilateral cooperation more difficult. international cooperation is indispensable, as it is the only way to reduce global emissions. the european union (eu) has set a goal

be regular checks along the way to assess the effects on european firms ' external competitiveness. if competitiveness deteriorates, then free allowances should be maintained to some extent, (and granted in commensurate levels to importers, to avoid protectionism). cbam is a tool to create a level playing field in the eu, as imports would have to bear the same climate costs as domestic production. however, cbam does nothing to create such a level playing field outside the eu. on the contrary, introducing cbam and phasing out free allowances may create competitive disadvantages for

starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam

with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made

trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a

own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only

what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the border, to steel imported from overseas.', 'reference': '937', 'full_answer': 'this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not.', 'sentence_beginning': ' this means ', 'sentence_end': ', for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not.', 'similarity_score': 0.760628342628479}, {'answer': 'the cost of carbon emissions', 'confidence': np.float32(0.06976033), 'start': np.int64(408), 'end': np.int64(412), 'context': 'on june 7, the european parliament will cast its final vote on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) proposal. this will mark the last opportunity for the parliament and the council of the eu to fine tune the mechanism and ensure its ultimate objectives can be fulfilled. as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu', 'reference': '174', 'full_answer': 'the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam).', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': ' will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam).', 'similarity_score': 0.7542920112609863}, {'answer': ""?

s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german

elaboration of the individual points can be found in the following corresponding paragraphs. 1) timing with the authorization process : companies face po-tential delays with authorization, as they are informed of cbam reporting obligations only after importing goods, ne-cessitating solutions like retroactive authorization. 2) threshold of one tonne : the one tonne threshold is unclear in its application and implications, requiring further clarifi-cation due to its seemingly low value. 3) concerns about compliance and authorization : companies risk losing cbam importer authorization due to difficulties in obtaining emissions data, highlighting the need for tai-lored compliance mechanisms, especially for smes. 4) administrative capacities : the requirement for proving suf-ficient administrative capacity poses significant challenges for smes, necessitating clear criteria for assessment. 5) revocation of authorization : there is a contradiction re-garding the revocation and reapplication of authorization, requiring clearer guidelines to understand the process. 6) clarifications for cross border operations : clarification is needed on the point of importers of less than one tonne, and the authorization mechanism should account for com-panies operating across multiple member states. 7) simplifications for aeo certified companies : a simplified authorization process should be implemented for aeo cer-tified companies, potentially exempting them from certain financial and operational capacity requirements. 8) clarifications of deadlines in the legal text : the deadlines for assessing applications are complex and interconnected, necessitating clarity and guidance on how extensions and additional information requests impact the initial deadlines. sagsnr. : 1

parliament will cast its final vote on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) proposal. this will mark the last opportunity for the parliament and the council of the eu to fine tune the mechanism and ensure its ultimate objectives can be fulfilled. as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences

what is the euemissions trading system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative

36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its

own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only

this puts (supra -) national industrial decarbonization efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie anti foreign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonization at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the cross border negative economic impacts of otherwise net global welfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net global welfare

introduction environmental subsidies are typically conceptualised as public spending (including governmental revenue foregone and in kind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the net zero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluter pays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition to a green economy and more than

parliament marked a significant shift in the political landscape, with right wing populist parties gaining ground, while green parties in a number of the european union ' s (eu ' s) member states were punished at the ballot box. notably, the governing parties in germany and france suffered substantial losses, potentially diminishing the influence of these major european powers. in this article, belinda schpe, china policy analyst at the centre for research on energy and clean air, explores how the election results will impact the eu ' s green policies and affect european businesses in china. the eu will likely remain committed to implementing its climate agenda following the recent elections despite the rise of right wing populist partiesas the european parliament continues to have a strong centrist presence. while green parties lost support, centrist parties came out strong and helped to secure a second term for commission president ursula von der leyen. [ 1 ] von der leyen has championed europe ' s climate policies with the largest green policy package the eu has ever seen, and the ambitious goal to make europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050 and reduce emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. this policy direction has led to the lowest level of eu emissions since the 1960s. [ 2 ] crafted amid global challenges like the covid 19 pandemic and russia ' s invasion of ukraine, these policies underscore the eu ' s deep rooted commitment to the climate agenda, which will remain a focal point going forward.

[ 4 ] therefore, in addition to the fit for 55 package laying out the eu ' s key climate targets and policies, the eu has also passed legislation such as the net zero industry act and critical raw materials act, which aim to strengthen european competitiveness in green technologies and offer opportunities for european businesses. over the coming five years, the eu is likely to further strengthen its industrial policy agenda. with new regulations kicking in over the next five years, the newly elected european institutions will continue to shape green policies with significant global implications, extending well beyond the continent ' s borders."", 'reference': '868', 'full_answer': ""[ 2 ] crafted amid global challenges like the covid 19 pandemic and russia ' s invasion of ukraine, these policies underscore the eu ' s deep rooted commitment to the climate agenda, which will remain a focal point going forward."", 'sentence_beginning': ' [ 2 ] crafted ', 'sentence_end': "", these policies underscore the eu ' s deep rooted commitment to the climate agenda, which will remain a focal point going forward."", 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'global steel industry problems will intensify', 'confidence': np.float32(0.0054964884), 'start': np.int64(475), 'end': np.int64(482), 'context': 'eurometal meets with eurofer to address challenges facing the european steel market on a visit to eurofer headquarters in brussels yesterday, eurometal held a high level meeting with mr. axel eggert, director general, and mr. karl tachelet, deputy director general for international affairs and external relations. eurometal was represented by its president, alexander julius, vice president fernando espada, board member jaap jan aardenburg, and director general ricardo silva. during the discussions, eurometal raised serious concerns about the growing influx of imported finished steel products entering the european market. this trend, already identified in recent exchanges with processors and manufacturers, poses a significant threat to the entire european steel value chain. eurometal emphasized that the increasing volume of these imports of ready made steel based products is undermining both the distribution and production sectors. the impact is being felt across logistics, processing, and distribution, with broader implications for the overall competitiveness of the european manufacturing industry an industry that supports 13. 6 million direct jobs. eurometal called for close coordination and joint action with eurofer to defend the integrity of the european market and ensure a level playing field for all stakeholders in the steel ecosystem. eurofer appreciated our position, and the meeting proved to be a solid foundation for exploring further collaboration in support of our shared agenda. worsening overcapacity forecast shows post safeguard measure urgency : eurofer the need for eu post safeguard measures has been amplified further by the oecd \' s latest finding that excess global steel capacity will grow from 602 million tonnes in 2024 to 721mt by 2027, five times the size of eu production, warns eurofer. at its meeting this week, the oecd steel committee concluded that growing overcapacity has resulted in a surge in exports of low priced steel that is threatening steel committee members \' production. chinese steel exports have more than doubled since 2020, surging to 118mt in 2024, while the country \' s steel imports plunged by almost 80 % to 8. 7mt. profitability continued to decline in 2024 and a growing number of countries have taken trade action.

reduction targets, a holistic approach to carbon accounting is crucial. while companies have made strides in improving energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy to reduce their direct scope 1 and 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions often form the majority of a company ' s carbon footprint. moreover, scope 3 emissions encompass all indirect emissions across a company ' s value chain. it ranges from purchased goods and services to transportation, distribution, and product use. so, with scope 3 emissions estimated to constitute on average 65-95 % of a company ' s total emissions, addressing scope 3 is imperative. it will help in making real progress on decarbonization. the european union ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism, set to launch in january 2026, is poised to be a game changer. it will incentivize companies to take scope 3 emissions seriously. so, by putting a carbon price on imports, cbam will encourage multinational companies. this is to work closely with suppliers around the world to reduce upstream and downstream carbon emissions. so, here ' s an in depth look at how can companies reduce their scope 3 emissions through the carbon border adjustment mechanism with its unique mechanisms. how does cbam work ? the carbon border adjustment mechanism will require importers to buy carbon certificates corresponding to the embedded emissions in their imported goods. furthermore, the carbon price will be based on that of the eu ' s emissions trading system. so, importers must report the emissions associated with their imports and surrender cbam certificates equivalent to those emissions. moreover, the system will start with cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizer, and electricity. the carbon border adjustment mechanism is intended to incentivize emission reductions while ensuring european industries are not disadvantaged. this is compared to foreign competitors with lower climate ambition. so, it will prevent carbon leakage by leveling the playing field between european producers. it will be by abiding by stricter climate regulations, and overseas companies that can afford to pollute more. cbam : encouraging supply chain decarbonization the carbon border adjustment mechanism provides a strong impetus for multinational companies sourcing materials and components from outside the eu. this is to work closely with

governmental revenue foregone and in kind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the net zero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluter pays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out

like to share the lessons that can be learned as part of this consultation. 1 / advantages of a cba such a mechanism which could take several shapes : taxes, mirror ets, standards, will shield eu energy intensives companies (steel, cement for example) from cheaper imports coming from third countries with none or with weaker climate policy (no carbon market, no carbon pricing). this adjustment will re establish a "" level playing field "" between eu companies and third country companies that could, for instance, take the form of a levy on imported goods, based on average prices in the eu \' s emission trading scheme (ets). such mechanisms will stop carbon leakages and avoid the race to the bottom for energy intensive industries while protecting the competitiveness of eu industries and

submits feedback in the attached file. vy government offices of sweden 27 march 2020 ministry of finance tax and customs department swedish comments on the inception impact assessment of a carbon border adjustment mechanism the swedish government appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), within the framework of the inception impact assessment. the issue of a cbam is complex and closely linked to several different policy areas. it is therefore essential with transparency and an open dialogue with member states and other relevant stakeholders as well as engaging broadly with relevant expert bodies throughout the further design process of the relevant measures. the swedish government supports the long term objective of climate neutrality in the eu and its member states by 2050 and believes that the eu ' s 2030 climate target should be increased to at least 55 % and be in line with the 1. 5 degree objective of the paris agreement. these measures are a prerequisite to maintain the eu ' s global leadership in the fight against climate change and to seize the economic benefits of the transition. while increasing the eu climate ambition, it is essential that the risk of carbon leakage is properly addressed. sweden has high climate ambitions and is in favor of eventually phasing out the free allocation in the eu ets as well as the compensation scheme for increases in electricity prices indirectly resulting from costs due to the eu ets. as a possibly more effective alternative to current measures that serve to safeguard against leakage, a properly designed cbam can enable the eu to keep its leading role in fighting climate change in a global context lacking equivalent climate action from other major economies. the impact assessment should analyze carefully how a phasing out of the current carbon leakage measures could be synchronized with an introduction of a cbam. the swedish government therefore welcomes a thorough analysis of the legal and practical feasibility of introducing such a cbam as an effective tool to avoid carbon leakage. the analysis needs, among other things, to consider implications on trade and competitiveness, including compatibility with wto tules. such an analysis will provide guidance to which type of policy measures that are best suited when designing a cbam. the swedish government agrees with the commission that the main objective of a cbam needs to be fighting climate change by avoiding carbon leakage. sweden has a long tradition of advocating the necessity of a well-functioning global free trade. the need for a cbam can only remain as long as differences in levels of"", 'reference': '1800', 'full_answer': 'while increasing the eu climate

'1. what is the euemissions trading system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative

smart and cost effective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climate neutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global

heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains how the cbam works and the impact on climate policies it is already having in the eu and around the world, as nations such as the uk and the us consider

adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the border, to steel imported from overseas.',

which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness and carbon leakage. addressing competitiveness should ensure that products that have a lower carbon intensity are not disadvantaged in the domestic as well as international markets, resulting in higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with

outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a

policy discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer

subsidy rules with industrial decarbonization environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra -) national industrial decarbonization efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie anti foreign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonization at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the cross border negative economic impacts of otherwise net global welfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net global welfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic co operation and development, the world trade organisation \' s trade and environment

excellent research assistance. 1 introduction environmental subsidies are typically conceptualised as public spending (including governmental revenue foregone and in kind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the net zero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluter pays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition to a green

arcelor mittal kryvyi rih and other steel companies had many plans for capital investments in decarbonization and reducing the carbon footprint of their products. a side effect in this case would be to increase competitiveness in the european market. since the european union formed its climate action plans for third country producers back in 2005-2006, we were informed, prepared for a long time, and understood that the carbon adjustment mechanism would sooner or later become a reality. unfortunately, february 2022 has crossed out many plans related to decarbonization strategies, not only in our company but also in many other companies in ukraine. as of today, it is very difficult to implement large costly projects that require, among other things, the involvement of international contractors and huge internal expertise related not only to construction, changing technological approaches, but also to strategic planning, monitoring, reporting, and verification of greenhouse gas emissions. the situation now is such that neither the decarbonization strategy can be fully implemented nor the search for expertise within the country can be 100 % complete. we are looking ahead,

not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not

purchase all of the necessary eu ets allowances on the market to remain globally competitive, as the remaining allowances are freely allocated to them. the cbam plans to gradually replace free allowances with a price on the carbon emissions embedded in imports. following a transitionalprimarily monitoring phase, this price on embedded emissions will be gradually introduced from 2026 on the imports of certain products. while the cbam can mitigate carbon leakage, production declines in greenhouse gas intensive industries as a result of limiting free allowances, and rising carbon prices, it cannot compensate for them completely. in particular, the cbam does not provide sufficient protection for exporters to non eu coun-tries. it is crucial that the cbam does not lead to trade con-flicts that would make multilateral cooperation more difficult. international cooperation is indispensable, as it is the only way to reduce global emissions. the european union (eu) has set a goal

have to make sure that the consumption complies with all the sustainable development goals including trade policy. before having a new carbon pricing system, the eu should, if necessary, suspend tariff preferences when non compliance with the provisions of the agreement on sustainable development upsets the balance of competitive conditions for european producers. secondly there is a possibility in the antidumping legislation to have tariffs also because of environmental requirements. carbon pricing mechanisms in agriculture and forestry should be based on the carbon farming

average prices in the eu \' s emission trading scheme (ets). such mechanisms will stop carbon leakages and avoid the race to the bottom for energy intensive industries while protecting the

importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 % simply cannot source their imported

growing pressure to develop and implement its own cbam. this policy tool, already adopted by the european union, is geared toward leveling the playing field for domestic industries while promoting global climate action and accountability. a future u. s. cbam could serve as a vital instrument in the nation ' s transition toward a net zero economy, encouraging domestic carbon footprint reduction

climate action while safeguarding its economic interests. as the world ' s largest crude oil producer and liquefied natural gas exporter and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (ghgs), the united states bears a substantial responsibility to address global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. the nation ' s pivotal role in the transition toward clean energy is underscored by the significant steps it has taken to reduce energy related co2 emissions and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. while the united states has implemented reforms to reduce ghg emissions, many other major economies are also taking bold actions to combat climate change and align their trade and climate policies in a bid to avert a climate crisis. the european union ' s fit for 55 proposals have focused on achieving significant net reductions in ghg emissions and addressing concerns over carbon leakage from imports. underscoring its commitment to contain carbon emissions at home and abroad, the european union rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in october 2023 to protect the competitiveness of local industry and encourage other countries to reduce their carbon footprint through clean industrial investment. a cbam is a critical policy instrument that levels the playing field for domestic industries by imposing a fee on imported goods commensurate with the

different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions

picture : over 75 % of companies affected by cbam are actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers

little gain georg zachmann and ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu climate policy. the eu should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in europe. recommended citation

starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu

emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs

little gain georg zachmann and ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu climate policy. the eu should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in europe. recommended citation

on specialties or pharmaceuticals. as an enabler of all other industrial sectors, the chemical industry has its role in all economic regions or clusters. to highlight just a few specific segments, technologies or regions would not be a suitable way to describe the strength of the german chemical industry. in 2023 around 2,100 companies partly organized in 40 chemical parks employed 479,542 people. due to the energy crisis and the industrial recession in 2023 sales decreased by almost 14 per cent to 225. 5 billion euros. 60 percent of total sales were generated with customers abroad. the

start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial

that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe

new in the i rec market ? will i rec continue to operate in china ? in short, no one knows. several draft policies have circulated recently within chinese policy circles, adding to the expectation of an impending decision. however, when a final call will be made is still uncertain. there are currently three possibilities for how things could progress : 1) i rec exits the chinese market ; 2) an agreement is reached for both certificate systems to coexist ; 3) the situation stays unresolved. each scenario has different implications for renewable energy buyers. click here to read a detailed explanation of how we think things could play out. i rec is moving from voluntary procurement to facilitating global trade new regulations to price the carbon embedded in imported products (such as

produced from natural gas in combination with ccs, or methane pyrolysis) can play in supporting the deployment of renewable hydrogen and the integration of higher volumes of renewable energy overall. in both scenarios, renewable hydrogen production scales up rapidly after 2030. however, a more diverse technology mix enables a lower cost (1 trillion less from now until 2050) and a more effective

demand for steel from the eu industry has risen as a consequence of the economic recovery. on the other hand, supply could not meet demand due to a reduction in domestic as well as imported steel production. whereas the reduction in domestic production has been intensified by the covid 19 outbreak, the reduction in imported steel is a consequences of certain eu trade measures, in particular the steel safeguard measures. steel safeguard measures safeguards are trade measures meant for situations in which an industry is affected by an unforeseen, sharp and sudden increase of imports causing (or threatening) serious injury to domestic industry. the eu steel safeguard measures were introduced as part of the european union ' s response to the 2018 decision by the united states to impose tariffs on steel products on national security grounds. until 2018, imports of steel products into the eu increased sharply against a background of a persistent overcapacity in the global steel market and unfair trade practices by certain trading partners. the eu investigation found that us tariffs on steel were causing a diversion of trade flows into the eu. for this reason, the eu has deemed it necessary to protect eu steelmakers against excessive imports with safeguard measures. the eu safeguard measures concern 26 steel product categories imported from a list of developing countries and take the form of tariff rate quotas (' trqs ') per country, above which a 25 % duty is levied on imports. the safeguard measures were imposed in july 2018 for a period until 30 june

emissions in france fell by 48 % between 1990 and 2019. industry now accounts for only 18 % of national emissions. thanks to these efforts, france has one of the most carbon free gdps in the world. industry is a key driver of recovery and sustainable growth. maintaining industrial activity is the key to all efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. the most decarbonised industrial products are and

to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. each industrial establishment in the territories attracts new activities and makes a useful contribution to local dynamism. industry is the key to the transition to a carbon neutral economy. producing in france is positive for the environment, for employment and for local finances. producing elsewhere is not the solution, neither in terms of carbon nor in

industry massively supports the ecological transition, it is even certainly its most vigorous driver (r & d, innovative technological solutions, circular economy, electrification of processes, low carbon heat, energy efficiency...). industrial greenhouse gas emissions in france fell by 48 % between 1990 and 2019. industry now accounts for only 18 % of national emissions. thanks to these efforts, france has one of the most carbon free gdps in the world. industry is a key driver of recovery and sustainable growth. maintaining industrial activity is the key to all efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. the most decarbonised industrial products are and will be made in europe, because the highest ambitions are thought out and implemented here. without a strengthened industrial base, the eu will not master all the key technologies that will enable us to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. each industrial establishment in the territories attracts new activities and makes a useful contribution to local dynamism. industry is the key to the transition to a carbon neutral economy. producing in france is positive for the environment, for employment and for local finances. producing elsewhere is not the solution, neither in terms of carbon nor in social terms. reducing the carbon footprint and avoiding "" carbon leakage "" : this is the objective of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) proposed by the european commission. france industrie shares this ambition and supports a cbam that has a positive effect on industrial competitiveness by creating fair and equitable

the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in

response to the 2018 decision by the united states to impose tariffs on steel products on national security grounds. until 2018, imports of steel products into the eu increased sharply against a background of a persistent overcapacity in the global steel market and unfair trade practices by certain trading partners. the eu investigation found that us tariffs on steel were causing a diversion

influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single

can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions

the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the net zero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluter pays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition to a green

industrial decarbonization and competitiveness : a domestic benchmark intensity approach issue brief 22-03 by raymond j. kopp, william a. pizer, and kevin rennert may 2022 1. background to achieve the net zero ambitions of the paris agreement, emissions from the "" hard to abate, "" greenhouse gas intensive industrial sectors (steel, aluminum, cement, and chemicals) must be reduced. the pace of current decarbonization efforts will be aided by the introduction of new low-and zero carbon production technologies driven by government policies. in many cases, products from these sectors are exchanged on highly competitive international markets, raising concerns that domestic decarbonization policies could result in lost competitive advantage vis a vis nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s preexisting approach to decarbonizing the industrial sector. another approach, which may be more appropriate for the current state of global climate policy, is to design an industrial decarbonization policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives to reduce emissions down to the performance metric, while offering additional advantages. by starting with a performance metric close to current us industrial performance, it would primarily affect those trading partners with higher emissions and not us producers. by assessing the fee', 'reference': '1474', 'full_answer': 'in

the process of industrial transformation, massive investments from eu industry are required that global competitors do not need to make. without an adaption of the competition policy framework, eu industrial competitiveness is at risk. cefic supports the overall direction taken by the green deal and the eu going climate neutral by 2050. the required industrial transformation will imply massive investments : a dechema analysis shows an investment requirement of 27bn per year between now and 2050. this will only be possible if private investment is enabled (amongst other things, by ensuring globally competitive conditions for industry in europe), and by ensuring sufficient public sector support is available. eu competition policy should be aligned with the green deal objectives and enable this massive transformation. it needs to balance newly market conditions as well as maintaining competition in the eu single market with the demands of industrial transformation in the pursuit of the environmental goals of the green deal. innovation wil be key for the success of the transformation. competition policy needs to aim at supporting innovation via competition and cooperation at the same time. the eu chemical industry is a driving player and already supplies the homegrown essentials for going clean, circular, digitalized and climate neutral. for the chemical industry, the eu

more advanced economies puts an unfair strain on their exports, potentially impacting their development. this may be in violation of the internationally recognized \' common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities \' principle that has guided multilateral climate action thus far. in order to avoid compromising a multilateral approach on climate mitigation and its own

ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu climate policy. the eu should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in europe. recommended citation zachmann, g. and"",

at limiting global emissions. however, another aspect needs to be considered, which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness and carbon leakage. addressing competitiveness should ensure that products that have a lower carbon intensity are not disadvantaged in the domestic as well as international markets, resulting in higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with asymmetrical climate change policies. border carbon adjustments (bcas) seek to alleviate the negative effects of uneven (asymmetrical) climate policies and may include imports and / or exempt exports. ensuring that both these aspects are included in the examination is critical for the effectiveness and

dialogue between eu and non eu countries. what this event is about the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as introduced in october 2023 initially applies only to a selected number of goods at high risk of carbon leakage : iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity generation. until 2026, the focus is on gathering and reporting the data required for assessing the carbon values of imported products. after this transitional period, importers of cbam goods must pay a fee, proportional to the carbon costs faced by domestic production. this gradual approach, focused mainly on carbon values, is intended to smooth the roll out and to facilitate dialogue with countries impacted by this measure. at the european level, the introduction of cbam will lead to the withdrawal of free carbon allowances for sectors vulnerable to carbon leakage. after 2030, the scope of the covered sectors will be expanded further. this betd side event hosted by the international network of the energy transition think tanks (inettt) had the form of a dialogue between eu and non eu countries. it cross checked the effects of cbam as intended by the eu (germany, poland) against the impacts expected in brazil, mexico, indonesia, trkiye and china on socioeconomic, political, and geopolitical levels. the event aimed to foster ideas on how to mitigate any potential negative

needs to be considered, which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness and carbon leakage. addressing competitiveness should ensure that products that have a lower carbon intensity are not disadvantaged in the domestic as well as international markets, resulting in higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with asymmetrical climate change policies. border carbon adjustments (bcas) seek to alleviate the negative effects of uneven (asymmetrical) climate policies and may include imports and / or exempt exports. ensuring that both these aspects are included in the examination is critical for the effectiveness and credibility of any approach being adopted. in the same train of thought,

could contribute to the climate transition and probably avoid protectionism. however, we view the third area-eu competitiveness with some concern. we would like to make the following points regarding the proposals now being put forward by the european commission : the basic structure of the system is in line with our expectations : a "" mirror market "" of ets. importers of goods included in the

here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who

'climate versus trade ? reconciling international subsidy rules with industrial decarbonization environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra -) national industrial decarbonization efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie anti foreign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonization at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the cross border negative economic impacts of otherwise net global welfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net global welfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic co operation and development, the world trade organisation \' s trade and environment committee and wto trade and environmental sustainability structured discussions, and the coalition of trade ministers on climate. the author thanks ronald

in kind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the net zero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluter pays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public

adjustment mechanism photo : artur widak / anadolu agency via getty images available downloads the issue the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in the united states presents an intricate policy challenge at the intersection of climate action and international trade. with countries around the world integrating climate considerations into their trade policies, the united states is under growing pressure to develop and implement its own cbam. this policy tool, already adopted by the european union, is geared toward leveling the playing field for domestic industries while promoting global climate action and accountability. a future u. s. cbam could serve as a vital instrument in the nation ' s transition toward a net zero economy, encouraging domestic carbon footprint reduction and driving trading partners to adopt cleaner practices. however, crafting and rolling out such a mechanism comes with knotty challenges, ranging from choosing optimal carbon accounting methods and pricing to warding off potential trade disputes and garnering global collaboration. as the united states charts its course through this complex policy landscape, it has the opportunity to shape global climate action while safeguarding its economic interests. as the world ' s largest crude oil producer and liquefied natural gas exporter and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (ghgs), the united states bears a substantial responsibility to address global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. the nation ' s pivotal role in the transition toward clean energy is underscored by the significant steps it has taken to reduce energy related co2 emissions and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. while the united states has implemented reforms to reduce ghg emissions, many other major economies are also taking bold actions to combat climate change and align their trade and climate policies in a bid to avert a climate crisis. the european union ' s fit for 55 proposals have focused on achieving significant net reductions in ghg emissions and addressing concerns over carbon leakage from imports. underscoring its commitment to contain carbon emissions at home and abroad, the european union rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in october 2023 to protect the competitiveness of local industry and encourage other countries to reduce their carbon footprint through clean industrial investment. a cbam is a critical policy instrument that levels the playing field for domestic industries by imposing a fee on imported goods

goods at high risk of carbon leakage : iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity generation. until 2026, the focus is on gathering and reporting the data required for assessing the carbon values of imported products. after this transitional period, importers of cbam goods must pay a fee, proportional to the carbon costs faced by domestic production. this gradual approach, focused mainly on carbon values, is intended to smooth the roll out and to facilitate dialogue with countries impacted by this measure. at the european level, the introduction of cbam will lead to the withdrawal of free carbon allowances for sectors vulnerable to carbon leakage. after 2030, the scope of the covered sectors will be expanded further. this betd side event hosted by the international network of the energy transition think tanks (inettt) had the form of a dialogue between eu and non eu countries. it cross checked the effects of cbam as intended by the eu (germany, poland) against

which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness and carbon leakage. addressing competitiveness should ensure that products that have a lower carbon intensity are not disadvantaged in the domestic as well as international markets, resulting in higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with

to carbon accounting is crucial. while companies have made strides in improving energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy to reduce their direct scope 1 and 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions often form the majority of a company ' s carbon footprint. moreover, scope 3 emissions encompass all indirect emissions across a company ' s value chain. it ranges from purchased goods and services to transportation, distribution, and product use. so, with scope 3 emissions estimated to constitute on average 65-95 % of a company ' s total emissions, addressing scope 3 is imperative. it will help in making real progress on decarbonization. the european union ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism, set to launch in january 2026, is poised to be a game changer. it will incentivize companies to take scope 3 emissions seriously. so, by putting a carbon price on imports, cbam will encourage multinational companies. this is to work closely with suppliers around the world to reduce upstream and downstream carbon emissions. so, here ' s an in depth look at how can companies reduce their scope 3 emissions through the carbon border adjustment mechanism with its unique mechanisms. how does cbam work ? the carbon border adjustment mechanism will require importers to buy carbon certificates corresponding to the embedded emissions in their imported goods. furthermore, the carbon price will be based on that of the eu ' s emissions trading system. so, importers must report the emissions associated with their imports and surrender cbam certificates equivalent to those emissions. moreover, the system will start with cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizer, and electricity. the carbon border adjustment mechanism is intended to incentivize emission reductions while ensuring european industries are not disadvantaged. this is compared to foreign competitors with lower climate ambition. so, it will prevent carbon leakage by leveling the playing field between european producers. it will be by abiding by stricter climate regulations, and overseas companies that can afford to pollute more. cbam : encouraging supply chain decarbonization the carbon border adjustment mechanism provides a strong impetus for multinational companies sourcing materials and components from outside the eu. this is to work closely with suppliers in reducing carbon intensity. furthermore, since the carbon costs of imports will impact profit margins, importing companies have a vested interest in helping upstream suppliers transition. this is due to low carbon production processes. so

actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent

simplifications, the eu cbam ' s timeline remains unchanged. large importers of carbon intensive goods covered by cbam will have to consider the financial impact of the tax as soon as 1 january 2026. accurate carbon data collection and early preparation will be critical to managing costs in the evolving cross border trade landscape. we broke down all the changes and highlighted business implications below. core changes 1. threshold adjustment : who is covered ? under the new rules, companies importing less than 50 tonnes of cbam goods annually (or roughly 100t co2e) will be exempt from cbam reporting and fees. this change lifts the burden from 182, small and occasional importers, replacing the previously impractical 150 monetary value threshold. the new threshold still captures 99 % of imported embedded emissions, according to the commissions ' trade and carbon data analysis. authorities will review the weight based threshold annually to maintain this coverage. note : customs authorities will monitor trade data and flag importers at risk of exceeding the new de minimis threshold, ensuring all relevant companies report to the cbam registry. occasional importers near the threshold must still obtain cbam importer authorisation. 2. 2027 cbam certificate sale delay cbam certificates will go on sale in february 2027, a year later than previously announced. while importers will have to surrender their first batch of certificates in 2027, they should cover 2026 imports. surrendered certificates will reflect the 2026 quarterly average of eu ets prices. note : businesses will therefore gain an extra year to prepare, but they must still track and report emissions quarterly throughout 2026. early preparation remains key in avoiding financial surprises in 2027. the revised rules also lower the certificate holding requirement from 80 % to 50 % of embedded emissions per quarter, easing financial strain on importers. 3. extended reporting deadlines to give importers more time and flexibility in reporting, several elements of the timeline have been updated. cbam declarations will be due 31 august instead of 31 may previously the deadline for

intersection of climate action and international trade. with countries around the world integrating climate considerations into their trade policies, the united states is under growing pressure to develop and implement its own cbam. this policy tool, already adopted by the european union, is geared toward leveling the playing field for domestic industries while promoting global climate action and accountability. a future u. s. cbam could serve as a vital instrument in the nation ' s transition toward a net zero economy, encouraging domestic carbon footprint reduction and driving trading

potential trade disputes and garnering global collaboration. as the united states charts its course through this complex policy landscape, it has the opportunity to shape global climate action while safeguarding its economic interests. as the world ' s largest crude oil producer and liquefied natural gas exporter and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (ghgs), the united states bears a substantial responsibility to address global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. the nation ' s pivotal role in the transition toward clean energy is underscored by the significant steps it has taken to reduce energy related co2 emissions and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. while the united states has implemented reforms to reduce ghg emissions, many other major economies are also taking bold actions to combat climate change and align their trade and climate policies in a bid to avert a climate crisis. the european union ' s fit for 55 proposals have focused on achieving significant net reductions in ghg emissions and addressing concerns over carbon leakage from imports. underscoring its commitment to contain carbon emissions at home and abroad, the european union rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in october 2023 to protect the competitiveness of local industry and encourage other countries to reduce their carbon footprint through clean industrial investment. a cbam is a critical policy instrument that levels the playing field for domestic industries by imposing a fee on imported goods commensurate with the ghg emissions associated

carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a,

however, another aspect needs to be considered, which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness

higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be

incentives and use their purchasing power to stimulate demand. developers need to deliver projects at cost levels that make removals an attractive option based on expected future carbon prices. in

processes, such as afforestation and soil carbon, or engineered solutions, such as direct air capture with carbon storage (daccs) or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (beccs). nature based solutions offer greater potential for scale at a lower cost per tonne. many deployment opportunities are available at cost levels below us $ 100 / tonne, compared with engineered solutions which currently range between us $ 100 and us $ 1, / tonne. high emitting countries with large land and natural resource availability such as the us, brazil, china, indonesia and india are in a good position to drive nature based project deployment. to date, most of the few removals attributable to human intervention have been generated by afforestation, reforestation and restoration (arr) projects, and 110 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (mt co2e) in annual capacity is registered with voluntary carbon standards. however, scarce resource limitations and competition dictate

(cbam), mohammed chahim (s & d, the netherlands), has presented his draft report to the european parliament ' s committee on the environment, public health and food safety. swedish enterprise believes that speeding up the introduction of the system would be unrealistic and therefore, we would argue against rushing it through. more importantly, phasing out the free allowances at the speed proposed by chahim is not a wise policy given the many uncertainties regarding how cbam would work and its effect on european competitiveness. hence, swedish enterprise stands by its previous line that free allowances can be phased out, but there should be regular checks along the way to assess the effects on european firms ' external competitiveness. if competitiveness deteriorates, then free allowances should be maintained to some extent, (and granted in commensurate levels to importers, to avoid protectionism). cbam is a tool to create a level playing field in the eu, as imports would have to bear the same climate costs as domestic production. however, cbam does nothing to create such a level playing field outside the eu. on the contrary, introducing cbam and phasing out free allowances may create competitive disadvantages for eu firms in third country markets. chahim acknowledges this but he has no concrete idea for how to address the issue. it should be added that reduced european exports to third markets may be negative for the climate as european products in general are more climate friendly than products produced in third countries. swedish enterprise supports the immediate inclusion of indirect emissions in the system. apart from the climate aspects of such a policy, it also eliminates distortion in the eu single market. swedish enterprise is skeptical about the addition of three extra product categories to cbam. this is a highly complex area and moderation needs to be applied when cbam is introduced. for example, the commission has argued against the inclusion of organic chemicals. rejecting this without a thorough analysis risks damaging the climate and european competitiveness. swedish enterprise has no position on the creation of a cbam

ets) what is the eu ets ? what is the cap and trade mechanism ? which gases and sectors are covered by it ? and how does it contribute to the eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in 2020 and is set to

trading system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu \' s

eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as introduced in october 2023 initially applies only to a selected number of goods at high risk of carbon leakage : iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity generation. until 2026, the focus is on gathering and reporting the data required for assessing the carbon values of imported products. after this transitional period, importers of cbam goods must pay a fee, proportional to the carbon costs faced by domestic production. this gradual approach, focused mainly on carbon values, is intended to smooth the roll out and to facilitate dialogue with countries impacted by this measure. at the european level, the introduction of cbam will lead to the withdrawal of free carbon allowances for sectors vulnerable to carbon

carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) puts forward a policy measure to prevent carbon leakage from domestic energy intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for

is the eu ets ? what is the cap and trade mechanism ? which gases and sectors are covered by it ? and how does it contribute to the eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in 2020 and is set to enforce a 62 % reduction by

"" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a

explores the implications of the recent landmark policies in the united states and european union for the evolution of climate policy over the next decade. abstract with the inflation reduction act in the united states and the carbon border adjustment mechanism established by the european union, ambitious yet contentious climate policies have been passed on both sides of the atlantic in recent years. each of these policies has spurred the other to consider not only the impact of these policies themselves, but whether the policies can serve as inspiration for further policy innovation. as new administrations are set to enter office on both sides of the atlantic, and as the geopolitical landscape is getting more complicated, we examine the implications of the recent landmark policies in the united states and european union for the evolution of climate policy over the next decade. we also reexamine the received wisdom on effective design for effective climate policy mix that targets net zero emissions goals. 1. introduction with the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira), the united states reversed a long period of lackluster progress toward passing expansive climate policy at the federal level. the shape of the irabased on extensive subsidies and industrial policydiffers from the approach favored in the european union, where a new policy package expands the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) and extends carbon pricing to select imported industrial goods through the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). notably, the united states ' newfound vigor for industrial policy and the european union ' s interest in combining climate and trade policies through cbam have inspired the other party to consider similar policiesafter some anguish about the possibly adverse competitiveness impacts. the cross fertilization of climate policies across the atlantic compels us to reexamine received wisdom on climate, industry, and trade policy. economists have long promoted a primary role for pricing carbon. yet even in the european union, a slew of regulatory and subsidy policies accompanies the eu ets, its flagship climate policy, while the united states has forgone carbon pricing in favor of the type of industrial policy that was long held as inefficient, or worse, ineffective. meanwhile, the resurgence of industrial policy is part of a larger reappraisal of the virtues and vices of free trade. two conclusions about transatlantic climate policy in the medium term seem safe to make at this point. the first is that industrial policy is here to stay"",

more responsibility for global interdependencies. the basic idea is to ensure that both human rights and environmental minimum standards are met along the entire global supply chain. since 1 january 2023, all companies in germany with more than 3, employees have therefore been obliged to check their suppliers in order to prevent possible violations. the law is intended to help improve and harmonise compliance with human rights and environmental standards worldwide. in this article, we show you what requirements the act places on your company and how new potential for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future can be tapped. since january 2023, all companies in germany with more than 3, employees have been obliged to comply with human rights and environmental standards throughout their entire supply chain. this means continuous monitoring of suppliers-all over the world, if in doubt. if a company recognises violations, it is now legally obliged to take measures to remedy the shortcomings. to ensure this continuous monitoring, companies must regularly report on their efforts to comply with human rights and environmental standards in their supply chains. these reports must be published. this ensures that an independent and, in case of doubt, public review can take place at any time. the implementation of the law is also monitored by the federal office of economics and export control. any infringements may result in fines and penalties. with these comprehensive monitoring options, the legislator wants to ensure that no companies can offer services or products in germany whose supply chain does not comply with minimum international human rights and environmental standards. supply chains have a significant impact on fair trade and the environment worldwide. therefore, a sustainable approach to supply chains is a decisive contribution to improving standards worldwide. treating suppliers fairly and paying fair prices for goods and services not only helps to improve working conditions in the producing countries, but also reduces the company ' s environmental footprint. in this way, fair business practices help to actively improve people ' s standard of living and implement more sustainable production on the global market. supply chains always function according to certain operating principles. if only profit is taken into account, there is a risk of exploitation, forced labor, child labor and inappropriate working conditions. monitoring supply chains, on the other hand, helps to improve working conditions worldwide. of course, the

recommendation for the cbam trilogues yara is europe ' s largest fertilizer producer with more than 3, employees and 18 production plants in europe, working across the entire supply chain, including agronomy, sales, production, and distribution, supporting customers in over 30 european countries. production of nitrate fertilizers in europe has on average the lowest carbon footprint in the world, helped by a catalyst technology that yara developed and has since been shared with the rest of the industry. this technology has enabled yara to reduce fertilizer production emissions from nitrous oxide (n20), a potent greenhouse gas (ghg), by more than 90 percent and lower our direct ghg emissions in europe by 55 percent since 2005. with product deliveries of more than 38 million tonnes in 2020, operations in more than 60 countries, and sales to 160 countries, yara is also the industry ' s leading international player. being a multinational company with a strong european footprint and serving agricultural markets in both hemispheres of the world, exports are crucial. out of 17. 7 million tonnes of products produced in europe in 2020, about 38 % were exported outside the eea. in this important phase of trilogue negotiations on cbam and eu ets, we call on the eu institutions to agree on a text which ensures that european low carbon exports maintain access to the global market. failure to do so (either by rejecting a solution or by kicking the can down the road) would not only undermine the competitiveness of european industries in strategic sectors, such as the agri food value chain, but also undermine the effectiveness of these climate related regulations. eu / eea low carbon products carry the cost of their emissions when competing with goods produced in third countries with loose (or non existent) carbon pricing rules. driving up the price of emissions is necessary to accelerate the uptake of low carbon technologies and products in europe. but adding the same level of costs on exports will lead to product substitution with goods that have a higher carbon footprint, increasing overall ghg emissions and carbon leakage. ultimately, a robust cbam should

it may become a useless, if not counter productive, trade policy measure. the eu aluminium sector consists of two main subsectors : primary aluminium (pa), producers of unwrought metal (smelters, which transform alumina into pa ; refiners and re melters, which produce secondary recycled aluminium from scrap) ; ds, downstream aluminium transformers (extruders, rollers, foundry casters ;

with a strong, low emission european steel industry and robust industrial value added networks that will secure prosperity and jobs in europe and achieve the climate goals through innovation. the steel industry is indispensable for europe as a business location and must be preserved and cultivated sustainably within the framework of the location policy. however, the downstream processing stages-such as the steel and metal processing industry-and other players in the supply chain have become more important in recent decades in terms of the number of jobs and economic importance and must be supported just as effectively in the transformation process. climate protection is a task for all states. a globally coordinated, high level of ambition in climate protection can create globally comparable competitive conditions for industry. it is not yet foreseeable that such a level playing field can be achieved in the medium term, not even at the level of the g20 states. for this reason, the president of the eu commission announced in connection with the presentation of her green deal for europe on 11 december 2019 that she would "" propose a co2 border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors in order to reduce the risk of carbon leakage "" \'. the system should ensure that import prices better reflect the cost of co2. according to wsm, comprehensive border adjustment measures could, under certain conditions, be suitable to compensate competitive disadvantages that eu companies face due to high climate protection standards. the risk of energy intensive industries or production migrating to regions with lower climate protection standards (carbon leakage) must be prevented at all costs. however, it must be ensured that free and rule based world trade, which is vital for the survival of the export oriented european industry, is not disturbed. border adjustment measures must therefore comply with wto rules and retaliatory measures by important trading partners must be ruled out. * european commission : "" communication from the commission to the european parliament, the european council, the council, the european economic and social committee and

carbon leakage protection. o o it must be recognised that future free allocation of emission allowances will be further reduced, also due to new benchmarks values, so it will be a challenge to provide sufficient carbon leakage protection already from the year 2021 onwards. also, current carbon leakage protection measures should be supplemented with additional measures ensuring adequate protection for imports and exports. the cbam as proposed by the commission is solely focussing on import and does not take into account exporting sectors. due to the unforeseeable consequences of a system

the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its

resulting in higher emissions. consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with asymmetrical climate change policies. border carbon adjustments (bcas) seek to alleviate the negative effects of uneven (asymmetrical) climate policies and may include imports and / or exempt exports. ensuring that both these aspects are included in the examination is critical for the effectiveness and credibility of any approach being adopted. in the same train of thought, it is important that both direct and indirect emissions are included in the examination that the european commission is proposing. bcas have three main objectives :-prevent leakage of carbon emissions to jurisdictions with weaker policies ;-create a level playing field in competitive markets ;-incentivise trade partners to strengthen their own climate efforts. ercst is currently considering these issues in much greater depth in a project entitled "" border carbon adjustments in the eu issues and options "" and will contribute to subsequent public consultations. ercst roundtable on climate change and sustainable transition 2020 feedback on the inception impact assessment carbon border adjustment mechanism ercst roundtable on climate

and trade ; the negative effects it would have on eu business ' competitivity (e. g. increased cost of imported inputs, having also an effect on export competitivity) ; the expected inefficiency of the measure as to emission reductions ; and the risk of removal of the current carbon leakage measures. realizing cbam wto consistently would be a challenge. cbam is a new issue that is not directly governed by wto agreements and it has not been addressed in dispute settlement. even with most careful preparation the measure would likely be challenged by trading partners. in a worse case scenario, partners would simply, without a dispute process, deem the measure an illegal trade barrier. if a cbam were realized, there could be discussion on the need and the possible removal of current carbon leakage measures. the question would arise whether cbam and the current measures could co exist and whether this would result in discriminatory treatment and be wto inconsistent. having partners view eu measures or activity illegal or as protectionism would lead to retaliation or similar unilateral action on their part. thus the measure and choices made could further deteriorate international cooperation, increase compliance cost and reduce competitivity, and increase the risk of trade wars. for now it is not known whether a cbam will be proposed and if so, what type of measure it would

extrusion. aluminium inherent properties like light weight, high strength, formability, conductivity and durability make aluminium an attractive material, thus resulting in increased use of aluminium worldwide. we welcome the eu climate policy and the european green deal (egd) which will be the core framework for european electro intensive industries in the years to come. our production of recycled and low carbon aluminium will provide an important contribution to the ambitions in the egd. hydro are amongst the producers with the lowest carbon footprint in the industry, and we are constantly striving to improve our performance. we will continue to have an ambitious sustainability agenda and recently launched our new climate strategy by which we aim to reduce our ghg emissions

the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu \' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu \' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to the eu \' s climate target. to reach this target, the commission proposes a steeper annual emissions reduction', 'reference': '1977', 'full_answer': 'the

leading to less economic activity in the eu and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the eu commission is considering implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as an alternative to the current free allocation of allowances or compensation for the increase in electricity costs. this mechanism proposes to counteract carbon leakage risk by putting a carbon price on imports of certain goods from outside the eu. ifiec supports the discussion initiated by the eu commission to incorporate an improved emission trading scheme. in this regard, the ifiec also generally welcomes all eu initiatives to improve carbon leakage protection for the european industry. the following aspects, however, should be taken into account. a cbam should only be introduced if the outstanding issues and concerns such as wto compatibility, carbon footprint assessment, certification and verification system, risk of protectionism escalation, export refunds, etc. listed below have been resolved. e a cbam should not replace already existing measures such as the eu ets free allowances and indirect cost compensation, since a cbam alone will not provide sufficient carbon leakage protection. o o it must be recognised that future free allocation of emission allowances will be further reduced, also due to new benchmarks values, so it will be a challenge to provide sufficient carbon leakage protection already from the year 2021 onwards. also, current carbon leakage protection measures should be supplemented with additional measures ensuring adequate protection for imports and exports. the cbam as proposed by the commission is solely focussing on import and does not take into account exporting sectors. due to the unforeseeable consequences of a system change, the free

"" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a

our proposal to the european commission \' s dg taxud : a systematic default value system to improve the cbam and safeguard the eu ets. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) was created to replace free allocation. the safest way of doing so is to apply default values when reporting embedded emissions. the current approach of emissions reporting under the commission implementing regulation (eu) 2023 / 1773 consists of measuring actual embedded emissions of imported products by tracing them back to the individual manufacturing plants where they were produced. although it may make reporting very accurate and create incentives for eu trade partners to export low emission products to the eu, this is not what the cbam was made for. more importantly, it undermines the cbam \' s initial goal and, therefore, threatens the sustainability of the eu emissions trading system (ets). example : the scrap loophole the emissions reporting method currently in place during the transitional phase creates incentives to export low carbon products to the eu, but that does not make exporters reduce their emissions. for example, making steel and aluminium products from recycled metal scrap emits much less co2 than if done by transforming freshly mined materials. both metals are already recycled widely in most countries and blended (or not) with freshly transformed primary materials to create new products. steel and aluminium exporters can therefore reduce the cbam fees charged for their products by strategically blending large amounts of scrap into products sold to the eu (subject to cbam fees) and less for products sold to other markets (not covered by cbam fees), without reducing their average carbon intensity. such circumvention would be perfectly legal but make

for when measuring the carbon footprint of imported goods pursuant to article 7 (6) of the regulation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). we believe that this poses a risk on the integrity of the cbam, by creating an incentive to circumvent the scheme through resource shuffling. this means that importers may escape cbam charges by choosing to only import to europe the goods with the lowest embedded emissions, while leaving the others out of europe, without changing production methods. resource shuffling could undermine the cbam the manufacturing of metal goods can sometimes be done by indistinctly using primary metallurgy (based on virgin ores) or metal scrap, with negligible difference in quality, as is the case for many aluminium products. if the embedded emissions of products from recycled aluminium are assumed to be zero, importers may have the possibility to escape cbam charges by choosing to only import products made from scrap. this is resource shuffling in action. this practice is not fraud and will be difficult for the commission to monitor and prevent. but its effect could be devastating on the cbam itself, as the distortion thus created between eu made goods (constrained under the eu ets) and imports (escaping cbam charges) would prevent eu producers from passing on their carbon costs to products sold, and lead to losses and ultimately, carbon leakage. no incentive to recycle assigning zero emission to metal scrap might be seen as a positive incentive for our trade partners to recycle more metals. however, this is not the

"" what is being simplified ? the omnibus package focuses on four key areas of sustainability regulation : 1. csrd (corporate sustainability reporting directive) requires large companies to report on environmental, social, and governance (esg) performance using standardized metrics (esrs). 2. csddd (corporate sustainability due diligence directive) mandates large firms to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights and environmental risks in their supply chains. 3. eu taxonomy regulation provides a classification system for sustainable economic activities, guiding companies and investors through disclosure requirements. 4. cbam (carbon border adjustment mechanism) imposes a carbon price on certain imports to prevent carbon leakage and ensure fair competition for eu producers. key changes introduced by the omnibus package 1. higher thresholds, fewer companies covered the threshold for csrd and eu taxonomy reporting has been raised from 250 to 1, employees, aligning with the csddd scope. this change excludes about 80 % of the companies that would have been subject to mandatory sustainability reporting, reducing the number from ~ 50, to ~ 10 ,. as a result, many medium sized and listed smes are no longer required to submit detailed esg disclosures. 2. simplified sustainability reporting (csrd) companies still subject to csrd will benefit from significantly streamlined esrs standards. the number of required data points is being reduced by around 70 %, with clearer instructions to reduce confusion and reporting fatigue. plans for industry specific standards have been scrapped. the assurance requirement will remain "" limited, "" avoiding more costly and intensive audits. a two year delay has been granted for many companies that were due to start reporting in 2026, now extended to 2028. 3. voluntary sme reporting standard the commission will provide a voluntary sme', 'reference': '357', 'full_answer': 'the number of required data points is being reduced by around 70 %, with clearer instructions to reduce confusion and reporting fatigue.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': ', with clearer instructions to reduce confusion and reporting fatigue.', 'similarity_score': 0.7784707546234131}]",streamlined European Sustainability Reporting Standards

towards reconciling the defense of energy intensive industries and the decarbonised economy. by applying the "" polluter pays "" principle, this tool will finally allow for fair competition at global level rather than simply outsourcing pollution. this principle is also attractive in terms of its apparent simplicity of establishment and its compliance with wto rules. this principle could become a key industrial policy tool in pursuit of a number of complementary and interlinked goals : 1. reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 2. the defense of the eu \' s highly strategic industrial sectors and the defense of workers in these sectors 3. applying global fair competition reducing greenhouse gases in energy intensive industries will most likely be through innovation of disruptions. however, it is clear that these technologies and innovations will result in a high cost, which could have a significant impact on employment in europe if they are not properly monitored and accompanied. it is therefore of utmost importance according to acv ccs meea to ensure that the carbon border policy is not in place on its own, but is accompanied by a set of policy and / or fiscal measures that will allow the border adjustment to be an adjuvant to the pursuit of 3 objectives mentioned above. for example, a policy / legal / regulatory / competitive innovation framework needs to be a prerequisite for the introduction of the carbon border adjustment principle. specific measures in public procurement could also be envisaged. the creation of a market that will be able to welcome these innovations

complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the

european carbon border tax : much pain, little gain georg zachmann and ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu climate policy. the eu should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon

european industries and higher energy security. we also understand that the recently introduced enhanced eu 2030 climate target seems likely to significantly increase the carbon price in the eu ets, which will increase the relevance of all mechanisms addressing the risk of carbon leakage. the commission has already expressed that it will consider introducing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in 2023 to address carbon leakage and to generate new revenues for the next generation eu (ngeu) program. according to the proposed work program of the commission for 2021, the legislative proposal for cbam and a proposal for cbam as own resource will be presented in q2 / 2021. we believe the risks related to the cbam far exceed the expected benefits and, hence, the cbam should not be introduced. the objective of the cbam is to replace the existing systems to address the issue : free emission allowances and compensations for industry due to higher electricity prices. instead of engaging in an effort to develop a new and untested means to address carbon leakage, the eu should stick to its current policy tools and continue minimising the risk of carbon leakage in its climate diplomacy. cbam is always a second best option in climate policy-even more so if it is unilateral. multilateralism i. e. a broad global coalition of countries implementing ambitious climate policies together should remain as the best option and the overall goal for eu ' s climate diplomacy. the eu has succeeded in leading and should continue to lead and push for progress in such a broad coalition through its own convincing policies. a broad coalition of ambitious countries would reduce the political counterparty risks and create a demand pull for cutting edge clean technologies developed in the eu and elsewhere. the cbam seems to be based on a false idea that markets and industries in the eu and their value chains are isolated from the rest of the world. the cbam would further increase

'context': ""edward norton lorenz ' s most famous butterfly effect rests on the notion that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non

other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the

the cbam undermines its goal of replacing free allocations under the eu ets. our proposal to the european commission \' s dg taxud : a systematic default value system to improve the cbam and safeguard the eu ets. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) was created to replace free allocation. the safest way of doing so is to apply default values when reporting embedded emissions. the current approach of emissions reporting under the commission implementing regulation (eu) 2023 / 1773 consists of measuring actual embedded emissions of imported products by tracing them back to the individual manufacturing plants where they were produced. although it may make reporting very accurate and create incentives for eu trade partners to export low emission products to the eu, this is not what the cbam was made for. more importantly, it undermines the cbam \' s initial goal and, therefore, threatens the sustainability of the eu emissions trading system (ets). example : the scrap loophole the emissions reporting method currently in place during the transitional phase creates incentives to export low carbon products to the eu, but that does not make exporters reduce their emissions. for example, making steel and aluminium products from recycled metal scrap emits much less co2 than if done by transforming freshly mined materials. both metals are already recycled widely in most countries and blended (or not) with freshly transformed primary materials to create new products. steel and aluminium exporters can therefore reduce the cbam fees charged for their products by strategically blending large amounts of scrap into products sold to the eu (subject to cbam fees) and less for products sold to other markets (not covered by cbam fees), without reducing their average carbon intensity. such circumvention would be perfectly legal but make imports pay less for embedded emissions than eu products, for which the blend of scrap is limited, on average, to the proportion of available good quality scrap in the continent \' s total production. pre consumer scrap : the ultimate loophole the scrap loophole was picked up by the draghi report for the case of pre consumer scrap : "" cbam is potentially easy to circumvent.

the global economy. to make the required transition a success, we will need strong governance frameworks that combine long term strategic planning complemented with compatible short-and mid term policy development. this will allow countries to achieve their climate neutrality objectives in a smart and cost effective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climate neutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver emissions reductions remains in line with keeping temperature increases in line with the goals of the paris agreement. with the launch of the european green deal and the eu ' s 2050 climate neutrality target, the eu is revising the main corpus of its climate regulations. the new intermediary 2030 target of at least 55 % means that eu and national targets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and emission reductions need to be ramped up and achieve transformative change during the next decade. while the targets and regulations may be set at eu level, a lot of the heavy lifting of the european green deal will have to be done at nationally. behind the 2030 and 2050 targets are very diverse member states facing different challenges to decarbonise and provide a just transition for their citizens. our work on national climate policies focuses on the need for strategic national investment plans for climate action. these plans should prioritise cost effective, long term solutions and avoid stranded assets or lock in effects. our research contributes to strengthening climate policy governance across europe and ensuring emissions cuts are cost effective and permanent. at the same time, we study the interactions between eu policies and climate policies outside the eu. policies such as the carbon

cooperation with eurelectric and others, data on indirect co2 emissions present in complex goods imports could hopefully be properly accounted for and charged once the cbam fully enters into force.

eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and

could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the

from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent

downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest

by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries, employment will also suffer. it is likely that certain european manufacturing sites will close to be ultimately relocated in non eu countries. according to a study conducted by the"", 'reference': '178', 'full_answer': 'the cost of carbon emissions will apply on
