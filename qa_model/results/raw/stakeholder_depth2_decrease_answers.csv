struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by

enables the recording, certification, and sharing of environmental and social sustainability efficacy, which supports the demands for transparency and confirmation of ethical practices within mining and steel manufacturing supply chains. the steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent

intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price-on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs of the covered sectors in europe and internationally. by addressing the risk of carbon leakage, the cbam aims to safeguard the reduction of global emissions within its scope. though the ultimate objective of the cbam is to cover a wide range of products, the current proposal covers a limited number of sectors deemed to be at high risk of carbon leakage and for which the introduction of the measure is administratively and technically feasible. the selected sectors are iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, and electricity, with extended coverage of 56 categories of goods down the value chain. to unpack the multiple layers of the cbam proposal and allow for an analysis of their implications, it is necessary to identify the multiple and often intertwined elements of its scope and affected stakeholders. the existing literature points to at least the following elements (marcu et al., 2020,2021) : policy mechanism or design, coverage of trade flows (i. e. imports, exports), geographic scope, sectoral scope,

in terms of trading volume and value. the eu ets covers various sectors, including power generation, heavy industry and aviation within the european economic area (eea). it will soon be extended to maritime transport, while a parallel scheme will be established for fuels consumed by buildings and road vehicles. the eu ets works by obliging all companies under its scope to surrender ' allowances ', i. e. pollution permits, for their greenhouse gas emissions. one allowance provides the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets. since companies can trade allowances freely with each other, their price is determined by supply and demand. for the first time, in 2023 the eu ets allowance price exceeded 100. how are eu ets allowances allocated ? there are two ways to obtain allowances under the eu ets. the main way is to buy them, either at auction (primary market) or from other companies (secondary market). auctions take place daily at the european energy exchange (eex). allowances can be traded on the secondary market at any time, either directly between buyers and sellers, or indirectly through intermediaries. an alternative way to obtain allowances is to receive them from the authorities for free. during the first compliance years of the eu ets, almost all allowances were distributed to companies for free. since 2008, the percentage of freely allocated allowances has been progressively decreasing. the share of free allowances

'leakage in climate policy discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only to rise by 95 tons', 'reference': '943',

cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers

importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their

own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only to rise by 95 tons', 'reference': '943', 'full_answer': 'the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the

mechanisms \' help tackle climate change ? multiple authors 10. 24. 24 multiple authors 24. 10. 2024 | 10 : 41am the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains how the cbam works and the impact on climate policies it is already having in the eu and around the world, as nations such as the uk and the us consider implementing cbams and related policies of their own. what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? why was the cbam introduced in the eu ? how will the eu \' s cbam work ? how is the mechanism expected to cut emissions ? what are the reactions from developing countries ? are other countries introducing their own mechanisms ? what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the border, to steel imported',

notion that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries, employment will also suffer. it is likely that certain european

should remain in place, be prioritised and improved ; a cbam would have to cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product containing the commodity. if not carefully thought through and prudently implemented, there are concrete risks of increasing costs across the entire supply chain and thus eventually undermining (rather than protecting) our industry ' s competitiveness in a world market ; a cbam must not replace, diminish or impair an effective trade policy, existing duties or affect trade defense measures like antidumping and anti subsidy tariffs as well as safeguards ; policymakers should first carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors (eg. steel, cement). if the cbam also covers the carbon content for indirect emissions in the imported product, then it must also reflect the additional indirect costs european producers face compared to other global producers, in order to ensure a global level playing field (due to marginal pricing in european power markets, indirect costs are not directly correlated to indirect emissions, as explained in this paper). hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the cbam. the two can co exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. overall, designing a

contribute to second consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knock on effects on

adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry

for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action

meanwhile, the european commission has proposed resources for the eu budget from emissions trading revenues, and from levies collected under the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). there proposals are pragmatic and move in the right direction, but do not go far enough. the debate about own resources should focus on whether the eu will be able to build genuine own resources based on common tax policies. the eu suffers from \' tax leakage \' in which profits are shifted from high tax to low tax eu countries, and from there onto no or low tax non eu jurisdictions, often without the application of withholding taxes. it may not be too much ofa stretch to compare this situation of tax leakage with the situation addressed by cbam-a quasi tax at the border. so far, an opportunity for

already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and

industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in

mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the', 'reference': '937', 'full_answer': 'many developing countries

have warmed the climate at an unprecedented rate. in response, both internationally and in north macedonia, policies to combat climate change have multiplied. for the private sector, beginning a decarbonization process means actively participating in national commitments, as well as anticipating international regulations that will become increasingly stringent. the eu ' s cbam, which affects export value chains, is a fitting example. cop28, held in dubai in december 2023, has confirmed the inadequacy of international commitments. the earth ' s surface temperature has risen by 1. 1c compared to the pre industrial period. to achieve the goal of the paris agreement, namely to limit the temperature increase to 1. 5c by the end of the century, emissions must be reduced by 60 % by 2030 (compared to 2019). as a consequence, countries are expected to update their nationally determined contributions (ndcs) with 2030 targets and present new targets for 2035. this cop28 decision underscores that these new ndcs have to be more ambitious. north macedonia ' s commitment north macedonia is a low ghg emitter, accounting for 0. 02 % of global ghg emissions in 2020. the country ratified the paris agreement in november 2017 and advanced its commitment to global ghg reduction efforts by submitting an enhanced ndc in april 2021, building on its initial ndc presented in 2015. the updated ndc sets forth the objective of a 30 % reduction in co2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. the primary emphasis of the initial ndc was on mitigating climate change, especially focusing on co2 emissions produced by fossil fuel combustion, which account for nearly 80 % of the nation ' s total ghg emissions. the updated ndc mainly targets mitigation strategies, intending to integrate adaptation measures in later submissions after the required national strategic and planning frameworks are established and approved. however, the revised ndc does not currently incorporate an adaptation aspect. to succeed in this low carbon transition and increase competitiveness, companies are called upon to play a fundamental role by committing to invest in clean and profitable

the european union emissions trading system (eu ets) is a cornerstone of the eu ' s efforts to combat climate change. launched in 2005, it is the world ' s first and largest carbon market in terms of trading volume and value. the eu ets covers various sectors, including power generation, heavy industry and aviation within the european economic area (eea). it will soon be extended to maritime transport, while a parallel scheme will be established for fuels consumed by buildings and road vehicles. the eu ets works by obliging all companies under its scope to surrender ' allowances ', i. e. pollution permits, for their greenhouse gas emissions. one allowance provides the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets. since companies can trade allowances freely with each other, their price is determined by supply and demand. for the first time, in 2023 the eu ets allowance price exceeded 100. how are eu ets allowances allocated ? there are two ways to obtain allowances under the eu ets. the main way is to buy them, either at auction (primary market) or from other companies (secondary market). auctions take place daily at the european energy exchange (eex). allowances can be traded on the secondary market at any time, either directly between buyers and sellers, or indirectly through intermediaries. an alternative way to obtain allowances is to receive them from the authorities for free. during the first compliance years of the eu ets, almost all allowances were distributed to companies for free. since 2008, the percentage of freely allocated allowances has been progressively decreasing. the share of free allowances decreased from 80 % in 2013 to 30 % in 2020 (eu ets directive, article 10a (11)). for the coming years, free allocation"", 'reference': '81', 'full_answer': ""this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets."", 'sentence_beginning': "" this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned "", 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7409284114837646}, {'answer': 'the declining demand from market participants', 'confidence': np.float32(0.14721283), 'start': np.int64(499), 'end': np.int64(503), 'context': 'the european emissions trading system 1 (eu ets 1) covers greenhouse gas emissions from energy and energy intensive industrial plants, intra european aviation and maritime transport. revenue from auctions totalled around 5. 5 billion euros in the eu ets 1 in 2024. this represents a decrease in revenue of around 28 per cent compared to the record amount from the previous year (2023 : 7. 7 billion euros). in contrast, revenue from carbon pricing in the national emissions trading system (n ehs) for heating and transport increased compared to the previous year. revenue from the n ehs in 2024 was around 13 billion euros, around 21 per cent higher than the previous year (2023 : 10. 7 billion euros). total revenue from both systems therefore increased slightly once again compared to the previous year.

""kemianteollisuus carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free

expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought

key, where we recognize the need for diverse and complementary means of reaching net zero. more broadly, eu energy policy needs to move towards a fully comprehensive and coherent policy framework.

by almost 40 %. a well integrated energy market will play a key role in incentivising investments in the energy system, ensuring a stronger convergence of energy prices within the eu and guaranteeing long term security of supply and lower prices for consumers. further action is needed to implement the electricity market design agreement and scrutinise any existing barriers to signing long term

remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the

""kemianteollisuus carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought

highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make

allowances ? the european union emissions trading system (eu ets) is a cornerstone of the eu ' s efforts to combat climate change. launched in 2005, it is the world ' s first and largest carbon market in terms of trading volume and value. the eu ets covers various sectors, including power generation, heavy industry and aviation within the european economic area (eea). it will soon be extended to maritime transport, while a parallel scheme will be established for fuels consumed by buildings and road vehicles. the eu ets works by obliging all companies under its scope to surrender ' allowances ', i. e. pollution permits, for their greenhouse gas emissions. one allowance provides the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets. since companies can trade allowances freely with each other, their price is determined by supply and demand. for the first time, in 2023 the eu ets allowance price exceeded 100. how are eu ets allowances allocated ? there are two ways to obtain allowances under the eu ets. the main way is to buy them, either at auction (primary market) or from other companies (secondary market). auctions take place daily at the european energy exchange (eex). allowances can be traded on the secondary market at any time, either directly between buyers and sellers, or indirectly through intermediaries. an alternative way to obtain allowances is to receive them from the authorities for free. during the first compliance years of the eu ets, almost all allowances were distributed to companies for free. since 2008, the percentage of freely allocated allowances has been progressively decreasing. the share of free allowances decreased from 80 % in 2013 to 30 % in 2020 (eu ets directive, article 10a (11)). for the coming years, free allocation of allowance"", 'reference': '81', 'full_answer': ""this effectively imposes a

emission trading system (ets) to cover emissions from buildings and the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) to adjust and equalize the price of imports of steel and other carbon intensive materials with the eu domestic price are the most relevant elements of the ' fit for 55 ' package for the construction equipment industry. extension of the eu ets the eu emission trading system (ets) is the eu carbon market. it works on the ' cap and trade ' principle. a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases. the cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. within the cap, operators buy or receive emissions allowances. after each year, operators must surrender enough allowances to cover fully its emissions. if an installation reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. buildings account for 40 % of the total energy consumed and for 36 % of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. for this reason, the commission is proposing the extension of the ets to buildings as well as transport in order to significantly reduce emissions over time. the new obligations from the extension of the ets to buildings will regulate fuel suppliers, rather than households. the suppliers will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the quantity of fuels they place on the market and for surrendering emission allowances each calendar year depending on the carbon intensity of the fuels. the new system will become operational as of 2025, with a cap on emissions set from 2026, based on data collected under the effort sharing regulation. during the first year, fuel suppliers will be required to hold a greenhouse gas emissions

2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to

climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and

quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by

tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and

believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as

policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron &

products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam

dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a

subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism

cbam is a system that imposes a carbon levy on imported goods, equivalent to the one applied to goods produced within the euand norway. this means imports with high carbon content will no longer benefit from unfair competitive advantages compared to products subject to stricter climate regulations. for norway, cbam will help protect domestic businesses from competition originating in countries with less stringent climate policies. which goods and industries are covered by cbam ? initially, cbam applies to the following goods : iron and steel aluminium fertilisers electricity cement hydrogen the eu has established a phased implementation : from october 2023 importers in the eu have been required to submit quarterly reports on the carbon emissions linked to imported goods (european commission). from 2026 reporting obligations will continue. from 2027 importers must begin purchasing cbam certificates to cover the emissions associated with their imported goods (according to the commission ' s guidelines). cbam affects a range of sectors such as steel, aluminium, and fertilisers omnibus : a major potential change the omnibus package could significantly reshape how cbam impacts both european and norwegian companies. proposed by the european commission in february 2025, the package introduces exemptions and simplifications that could reduce the number of norwegian

product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers

that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism.

outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of

jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon

based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu \' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu \' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18

affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors.

the main european fertilizer products have a climate footprint that is typically half of the global average. an effective and well designed cbam should aim at avoiding the replacement of ammonia,

own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only

eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam.

mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only

think again. the numbers paint a surprising picture : over 75 % of companies affected by cbam are actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a

tai-lored compliance mechanisms, especially for smes. 4) administrative capacities : the requirement for proving suf-ficient administrative capacity poses significant challenges for smes, necessitating clear criteria for assessment. 5) revocation of authorization : there is a contradiction re-garding the revocation and reapplication of authorization, requiring clearer guidelines to understand the process. 6) clarifications for cross border operations : clarification is needed on the point of importers of less than one tonne, and the authorization mechanism should account for com-panies operating across multiple member states. 7) simplifications for aeo certified companies : a simplified authorization process should be implemented for aeo cer-tified companies, potentially exempting them from certain financial and operational capacity requirements. 8) clarifications of deadlines in the legal text : the deadlines for assessing applications are complex and interconnected,

companies scramble to find other qualified suppliers of goods and critical components. a big reason why supply chains are struggling is that risk management has tended to lack the prominence and rigor that companies have long devoted to optimizing cost and efficiency. therefore, many companies merely react to crises, often after the damage has been done. nor have many companies adequately prepared for sharp policy shifts, like tariff hikes and curbs on high tech trade and investment, that can upend long established supplier relationships. to be ready for the unexpected, companies should establish a robust system for assessing and monitoring their exposure to geopolitical risk and building supply chain resilience. they should design global sourcing networks based on a holistic, ""

environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added

had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their

eu intends to implement the cbam as early as 2023 with at least three years of a transition period. as per the recently leaked draft of the legislative proposal, the eu cbam would only cover limited industrial sectors by imposing carbon prices on the imports of iron and steel, cement and clinker, fertilizer, aluminum, and electricity at the eu border. the policy ' s direct impact would vary from country to country. for example, the cbam targeted products altogether account for about three percent of the export volume of the eu ' s largest trading partner china to the eu. the percentage is

of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive

companies in transition like tata steel nederland for example through financial measures and faster permitting processes. at the same time, the right (framework) conditions need to be established : ensuring the necessary sufficient clean energy production, competitive network cost and also creating a market for clean products like green steel. all in a european level playing field situation, also on (energy) taxation and exemptions. this happens in a challenging context, where the european steel industry is facing significant pressures due to competition from third countries especially

proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free

half of the month saw energy prices surge, triggered by the escalating geopolitical risks of the israel hamas war. however, prices plummeted as the month progressed, reflecting bearish fundamental drivers. hydro balances in most central european markets improved significantly, reaching a comfortable surplus. factors such as full gas storage, ample french nuclear availability, and persistent weak demand also contributed to the erosion of risk premium in various winter power contracts. geopolitical risks briefly amplified risk premiums across various energy commodities. gas markets were no

higher prices of steel products in the second half of 2020 as well as in the first quarter of 2021. they call for an end of the steel safeguard measures to ensure a competitive steel market and favorable market conditions. the main reason for the price surge seems to be a supply demand imbalance in the european steel market. on the one hand demand for steel from the eu industry has risen as a consequence of the economic recovery. on the other hand, supply could not meet demand due to a reduction in domestic as well as imported steel production. whereas the reduction in domestic production has been intensified by the covid 19 outbreak, the reduction in imported steel is a consequences of certain eu trade measures, in particular the steel safeguard measures. steel safeguard measures safeguards are trade measures meant for situations in which an industry is affected by an unforeseen, sharp and sudden increase of imports causing (or threatening) serious injury to domestic industry. the eu steel safeguard measures were introduced as part of the european union ' s response to the 2018 decision by the united states to impose tariffs on steel products on national security grounds. until 2018, imports of steel products into the eu increased sharply against a background of a persistent overcapacity in the global steel market and unfair trade practices by certain trading partners. the eu investigation found that us tariffs on steel were causing a diversion of trade flows into the eu. for this reason, the eu has deemed it necessary to protect eu steelmakers against excessive imports with safeguard measures. the eu safeguard measures concern 26 steel product categories imported from a list of developing countries and take the form of tariff rate quotas (' trqs ') per country, above which a 25 % duty is levied on imports. the safeguard measures were imposed in july 2018 for a period until 30 june 2021. following a request of 12 eu member states the commission

challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a

with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions', 'reference': '174', 'full_answer': 'as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively

reforms aim to address the shortcomings of the current legislation and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customs procedures within the european union (eu). in particular, the proposal introduces the european customs authority, the eu customs data hub, and the trust and check trader status. we commend the commission for its dedication to enhancing customs operations and believe that these reforms could contribute to a more seamless and secure trade environment. eea would like to welcome the opportunity to comment on the proposal on the reform of the eu customs union. we consider that the input from the express industry is not only valuable but critical. as we continue to closely cooperate on the it developments under the current union customs code and the related work

eu customs union in the decades to come. along these lines, we would like to formally express our willingness and readiness to work with the eu institutions and the eu member states to ensure a balanced and successful customs reform. we hope that this will be recognized and eea will become a strategic partner in the upcoming negotiations. 1. trust and check trader we acknowledge that the

introduction of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) by the european commission is aimed at preventing the risk of carbon leakage and supporting the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation. the objective of this mechanism is to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports while ensuring that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less stringent policies. nitrogen fertilizer producers are among sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage due to the industry ' s emission intensity and exposure to international trade. the european fertilizer industry therefore welcomed the european commission ' s initiative to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism., but, since the beginning, underlined that for the fertilizer sector cbam would only work if eu ets free allocations at full benchmark level were maintained at least till 2030 and if cbam would also foresee a solution for the export part of the production. a well designed cbam could be particularly important for the sector since already today the main european fertilizer products have a climate footprint that is typically half of the global average. an effective and well designed cbam should aim at avoiding the replacement of ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers produced in europe with imports from countries with a worse carbon footprint while at the same time allowing the transformation of the industry toward a zero carbon production. fertilizers europe is therefore advocating for the cbam designed as a reinforcement of current carbon leakage measures with the stepped up climate ambition. why do we need an equal treatment between the ets and cbam sectors achieving a higher level of emission reduction ambition, requires mechanisms to strenghten carbon leakage protection and minimise negative impact on exports. complementarity of cbam with free allocation is key to protect value chains, mitigate the impact on trade flows and provide certainties for low carbon investments. cbam, and the current system of ets free allocations, should aim to effectively support the industry in meeting the increased climate

attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower

with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in

environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries :

occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries, employment will also suffer. it is likely that certain european manufacturing sites will close to be ultimately relocated in non eu countries. according to a"", 'reference': '178', 'full_answer': 'however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to

industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict

transformation and why green innovations also depend on fair competition. market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? the transformation to carbon neutrality is complex. for tata steel this means transforming our production process while still producing steel in the traditional way and also maintaining the high quality standards. furthermore, it is also a political challenge. the transformation of european industry means facilitating the transformation of companies in transition like tata steel nederland for example through financial measures and faster permitting processes. at the same time, the right (framework) conditions need to be established : ensuring the necessary sufficient clean energy production, competitive network cost and also creating a market for clean products like green steel. all in a european level playing field situation, also on (energy) taxation and exemptions. this happens in a challenging context, where the european steel industry is facing significant pressures due to competition from third countries especially our strategic rivals. market steel : what do you see as the biggest challenges to decarbonization, and how could european policymakers help to address them ? given the challenges faced by the entire european steel industry, the european commission needs to enact a steel action plan, aiming at solving the immediate issues faced by industry and facilitating the clean transformation of steel companies. market steel : green hydrogen is a key component of europe ' s decarbonization strategy. what specific steps should european policymakers take to promote the production and availability of green hydrogen in europe ? unfortunately, over the past four years, cost expectations of green hydrogen in 2030 have become increasingly pessimistic. this is largely because initial estimates failed

(cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment

of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will

eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent

adjustment mechanism (cbam) in the united states presents an intricate policy challenge at the intersection of climate action and international trade. with countries around the world integrating climate considerations into their trade policies, the united states is under growing pressure to develop and implement its own cbam. this policy tool, already adopted by the european union, is geared toward leveling the playing field for domestic industries while promoting global climate action and accountability. a future u. s. cbam could serve as a vital instrument in the nation ' s transition toward a net zero economy, encouraging domestic carbon footprint reduction and driving trading partners to adopt cleaner practices. however, crafting and rolling out such a mechanism comes with knotty challenges, ranging from choosing optimal carbon accounting methods and pricing to warding off potential trade disputes and garnering global collaboration. as the united states charts its course through this complex policy landscape, it has the opportunity to shape global climate action while safeguarding its economic interests. as the world ' s largest crude oil producer and liquefied natural gas exporter and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (ghgs), the united states bears a substantial responsibility to address global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. the nation ' s pivotal role in the transition toward clean energy is underscored by the significant steps it has taken to reduce energy related co2 emissions and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. while the united states has implemented reforms to reduce ghg emissions, many other major economies are also taking bold actions to combat climate change and align their trade and climate policies in a bid to avert a climate crisis. the european union ' s fit for 55 proposals have focused on achieving significant net reductions in ghg emissions and addressing concerns over carbon leakage from imports. underscoring its commitment to contain carbon emissions at home and abroad, the european union rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in october 2023 to protect the competitiveness of local industry and encourage other countries to reduce their carbon footprint through clean industrial investment. a cbam is a critical policy instrument that levels the playing field for domestic industries by imposing a fee on imported goods commensurate with the ghg emissions associated with their production. this fee is inextricably linked to an explicit carbon price,

does it contribute to the eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in 2020 and is set to enforce a 62 % reduction by 2030. as part of the eu ' fit for 55 package ' the eu ets was revised to align it

years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on

european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted

prevent possible violations. the law is intended to help improve and harmonise compliance with human rights and environmental standards worldwide. in this article, we show you what requirements the act places on your company and how new potential for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future can be tapped. since january 2023, all companies in germany with more than 3, employees have been obliged to comply with human rights and environmental standards throughout their entire supply chain. this means continuous monitoring of suppliers-all over the world, if in doubt. if a company recognises violations, it is now legally obliged to take measures to remedy the shortcomings. to ensure this continuous monitoring, companies must regularly report on their efforts to comply with human rights and environmental standards in their supply chains. these reports must be published. this ensures that an independent and, in case of doubt, public review can take place at any time. the implementation of the law is also monitored by the federal office of economics and export control. any infringements may result in fines and penalties. with these comprehensive monitoring options, the legislator wants to ensure that no companies can offer services or products in germany whose supply chain does not comply with minimum international human rights and environmental standards. supply chains have a significant impact on fair trade and the environment worldwide. therefore, a sustainable approach to supply chains is a decisive contribution to improving standards worldwide. treating suppliers fairly and paying fair prices for goods and services not only helps to improve working conditions in the producing countries, but also reduces the company ' s environmental footprint. in this way, fair business practices help to actively improve people ' s standard of living and implement more sustainable production on the global market. supply chains always function according to certain operating principles. if only profit is taken into account, there is a risk of exploitation, forced labor, child labor and inappropriate working conditions. monitoring supply chains, on the other hand, helps to improve working conditions worldwide. of course, the implementation of the act significantly increases the workload for companies. however, this is only one side of the coin. the

industry. tyres are not like any other component of the vehicle, which drivers may never have to interact with. tyres are changed on average four times in the lifetime of a vehicle, and on them depends the performance of the vehicle when it comes to safety, impact on environment / consumption / battery duration. this is why they should be considered as a consumer product as well as a component, for which the consumer has the responsibility of choice as well as of maintenance. recognising that the tyre and rubber sector is crucial for the automotive sector and the mobility ecosystem at large, etrma would like to share its key policy recommendations designed to support the european twin transition and contribute to the competitiveness, sustainability, and innovation of europe ' s automotive ecosystem. these recommendations are in line with draghi ' s report on the future of europe ' s competitiveness and with the strategic goals of the european green deal, digital

speaking with donald thomson, ceo of the center for regenerative design and collaboration (crdc). in this second interview, we will be speaking with carlos monreal, founder and ceo of plastic energy. join us as we delve deeper into the efforts of plastic energy to tackle the issue of plastic waste and create value from it. plastic waste is a global problem that has far reaching environmental impacts, and plastic energy is a company that aims to address this issue. founded by carlos monreal more than a decade ago, the company has been developing its unique tac process for plastic waste. our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company has projects in europe, asia, and the us. with three plants currently under construction in europe, plastic energy aims to recycle 5 million tonnes of plastic waste by 2030. carlos reveals that they have partnered with sabic for a 20 kt facility in the netherlands', 'reference': '858', 'full_answer': 'our tac process is a chemical

steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount

less ambitious climate policies, leading to less economic activity in the eu and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the eu commission is considering implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as an alternative to the current free allocation of allowances or compensation for the increase in electricity costs. this mechanism proposes to counteract carbon leakage risk by putting a carbon price on imports of certain goods from outside the eu. ifiec supports the discussion initiated by the eu commission to incorporate an improved emission trading scheme. in this regard, the ifiec also generally welcomes all eu initiatives to improve carbon leakage protection for the european industry. the following aspects, however, should be taken into account. a cbam should only be introduced if the outstanding issues and concerns such as wto compatibility, carbon footprint assessment, certification and verification system, risk of protectionism escalation, export refunds, etc. listed below have been resolved. e a cbam should not replace already existing measures such as the eu ets free allowances and indirect cost compensation, since a cbam alone will not provide sufficient

cbam is a system that imposes a carbon levy on imported goods, equivalent to the one applied to goods produced within the euand norway. this means imports with high carbon content will no longer benefit from unfair competitive advantages compared to products subject to stricter climate regulations. for norway, cbam will help protect domestic businesses from competition originating in countries with less stringent climate policies. which goods and industries are covered by cbam ? initially, cbam applies to the following goods : iron and steel aluminium fertilisers electricity cement hydrogen the eu has established a phased implementation : from october 2023 importers in the eu have been required to submit quarterly reports on the carbon emissions linked to imported goods (european commission). from 2026 reporting obligations will continue. from 2027 importers must begin purchasing cbam certificates to cover the emissions associated with their imported goods (according to the commission ' s guidelines). cbam affects a range of sectors such as steel, aluminium, and fertilisers omnibus : a major potential change the omnibus package could significantly reshape how cbam impacts both european and norwegian companies. proposed by the european commission in february 2025, the package introduces exemptions and simplifications that could reduce the number of norwegian businesses affected by cbamfrom around 8, to 300. key proposals in the omnibus package include : a new de minimis threshold importers bringing in less than 50 tonnes per year could be exempt postponement of certificate trading originally planned for 2026, now proposed to be delayed until february 2027 changes to reporting deadlines the annual cbam declaration may be moved from 31 may to 31 october for the omnibus package to take effect, it must be approved by the european parliament and eu member states. negotiations are ongoing, but a final timeline has not yet been set. source : european commission proposals when will cbam be introduced in norway ?

contribute to second consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knock on effects on

streamlined esrs standards. the number of required data points is being reduced by around 70 %, with clearer instructions to reduce confusion and reporting fatigue. plans for industry specific standards have been scrapped. the assurance requirement will remain "" limited, "" avoiding more costly and intensive audits. a two year delay has been granted for many companies that were due to

' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and

2030. this tool is designed to avoid the risk of carbon leakage that arises as the differential in carbon costs increases between europe and third countries. while the european industry fully supports this decarbonization objective, it needs accompanying measures to preserve its competitiveness and investment capacities. the cbam seeks to achieve these goals. yet, in a recent research (french version here), we pointed out that the fine tuning of the mechanism, still under discussion, is so complex that industrial stakeholders do not all fully support the measure. relying on the 2020 public consultation launched by the european commission and interviews with around 50 representatives of manufacturing organizations and companies, we found out that preferences of european industry regarding the fine tuning of the mechanism are built on sectoral specificities. being unevenly exposed to certain risks undermining their competitiveness in europe and on international markets, industrial companies do not easily reach common ground. indeed, some sectors are more exposed to risks of retaliation from trade partners or circumvention of the cbam through resource shuffling. some also fear that the risks of carbon leakage will be shifted to the downstream segments of their value chain. compatibility with the world trade organization \' s rules is also a concern for some of them. the exposure to those risks therefore depends on sectoral specificities such as complexity of the value chain, vulnerability of the downstream segment, exposure to resource shuffling or to international competition. averse to uncertainty, industrial stakeholders turn to older measures that preserved their competitiveness during the first phases of the emissions trading system (eu ets),

contained in post consumer metal scrap will not be accounted for when measuring the carbon footprint of imported goods pursuant to article 7 (6) of the regulation on the carbon border adjustment

cbam charges by choosing to only import to europe the goods with the lowest embedded emissions, while leaving the others out of europe, without changing production methods. resource shuffling could undermine the cbam the manufacturing of metal goods can sometimes be done by indistinctly using primary metallurgy (based on virgin ores) or metal scrap, with negligible difference in quality, as is the case for many aluminium products. if the embedded emissions of products from recycled aluminium are assumed to be zero, importers may have the possibility to escape cbam charges by choosing to only import products made from scrap. this is resource shuffling in action. this practice is not fraud and will be difficult for the commission to monitor and prevent. but its effect could be devastating on the cbam itself, as the distortion thus created between eu made goods (constrained under the eu ets) and imports (escaping cbam charges) would prevent eu producers from passing on their

default value system to improve the cbam and safeguard the eu ets. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) was created to replace free allocation. the safest way of doing so is to apply default values when reporting embedded emissions. the current approach of emissions reporting under the commission implementing regulation (eu) 2023 / 1773 consists of measuring actual embedded emissions of imported products by tracing them back to the individual manufacturing plants where they were produced. although it may make reporting very accurate and create incentives for eu trade partners to export low emission products to the eu, this is not what the cbam was made for. more importantly, it undermines the cbam \' s initial goal and, therefore, threatens the sustainability of the eu emissions trading system (ets). example : the scrap loophole the emissions reporting method currently in place during the transitional phase creates incentives to export low carbon products to the eu, but that does not make exporters reduce their emissions. for example, making steel and aluminium products from recycled metal scrap emits much less co2 than if done by transforming freshly mined materials. both metals are already recycled widely in most countries and blended (or not) with freshly transformed primary materials to create new products. steel and aluminium exporters can therefore reduce the cbam fees charged for their products by strategically blending large amounts of scrap into products sold to the eu (subject to cbam fees) and less for products sold to other markets (not covered by cbam fees), without reducing their average carbon intensity. such circumvention would be perfectly legal but make imports pay less for embedded emissions than eu products, for which the blend of scrap is limited, on average, to the proportion of available good quality scrap in the continent \' s total production. pre consumer scrap : the ultimate loophole the scrap loophole was picked up by the draghi report for the case of pre consumer scrap : "" cbam is potentially easy to circumvent.

states inevitably raises questions for energy policy. energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in europe and elsewhere. the role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. gas supplied 43 percent of u. s. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. as policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas. to probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of u. s. manufacturing from a carbon

you will gain the tools to meet regulations, enhance transparency, and avoid risks. the eu deforestation regulation (eudr) is transforming global trade by ensuring that commodities like coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber are sourced without contributing to deforestation. businesses must now demonstrate compliance through traceability, due diligence, and risk assessments to maintain access to the eu market. eudr is not just a legal requirement. it marks a fundamental shift toward sustainable supply chains. companies that fail to comply face penalties, reputational risks, and potential market exclusion, while those that adapt early can gain a competitive edge and enhance their global credibility. achieving compliance requires robust data collection, supply chain transparency, and proactive engagement with suppliers. this workshop provides practical strategies, industry case studies, and best practices to help businesses navigate eudr requirements, mitigate risks, and implement effective sustainability measures. companies importing key commodities into the eu must establish robust traceability and due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the eu deforestation regulation (eudr). this is a crucial phase in preparing for full enforcement, where non compliance may lead to penalties and restricted market access. businesses will be required to provide geolocation data, risk assessments, and deforestation free verification for affected products such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber. early investment in supply chain transparency, digital tracking tools, and supplier engagement can offer a competitive advantage while minimizing future compliance risks. the shift toward deforestation free trade will impact pricing, sourcing strategies, and supply chain structures, making early preparation essential. we are in a critical transition phase where companies must act now to align with eudr. this training will provide best practices, case studies, and compliance strategies to help businesses navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and ensure full readiness. program overview day 1 : understand the european deforestation regulation (eudr) and its impact on industries, focusing on the causes and consequences of deforestation and forest degradation. learn about the deforestation free requirements and due

2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and

including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and

automotive value chain, the european tyre and rubber manufacturers association (etrma) strongly supports efforts to ensure a competitive and sustainable future for the european automotive industry. tyres are not like any other component of the vehicle, which drivers may never have to interact with. tyres are changed on average four times in the lifetime of a vehicle, and on them depends the performance of the vehicle when it comes to safety, impact on environment / consumption / battery duration. this is why they should be considered as a consumer product as well as a component, for which the consumer has the responsibility of choice as well as of maintenance. recognising that the tyre and rubber sector is crucial for the automotive sector and the mobility ecosystem at large, etrma would like to share its key policy recommendations designed to support the european twin transition and contribute to the competitiveness, sustainability, and innovation of europe ' s automotive ecosystem. these recommendations are in line with draghi ' s report on the future of europe ' s competitiveness and with the strategic goals of the european green deal, digital competitiveness, and single market efficiency. by implementing these measures, europe can bolster its competitive edge in the global automotive sector, ensure economic security, and drive sustainable growth without compromising environmental standards. the tyre industry at a crossroads no silver bullet, but a conducive regulatory environment the european tyre industry has been a stronghold of european manufacturing, with a total contribution of close to 44 billion to the eu gdp and creating a total employment of nearly 500, people. high energy, labor and raw material costs, paired with strong price competition from tyres produced outside the eu, have negatively impacted the competitiveness of our industry which now needs a boost just like the rest of the automotive ecosystem. the recommendations listed below are no silver bullet but rather aim at creating a legislative environment that will be conducive to a gain in competitiveness, minimising the bureaucratic burden deriving from previous legislations, such as the eu deforestation regulation, or from lack of eu harmonisation, as in the case of end of waste criteria. these need to be accompanied and supported by a wider strategy, that

industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or

in a carbon competitive world photo : grispb via adobe stock available downloads introduction a variety of forces are promoting reindustrialization of the united states. concerned about the fragility of long supply chains, some firms are reinvesting in u. s. production. they are enabled by government support ranging from tax subsidies for capital investment to active support for strategic industries that will keep the united states at the technological frontier or that relate closely to national security. expanding manufacturing in the united states inevitably raises questions for energy policy. energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in europe and elsewhere. the role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. gas supplied 43 percent of u. s. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. as policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas. to probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of u. s. manufacturing from a carbon intensity perspective. this paper presents the key findings from csis ' s researchincluding from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviewsand policy recommendations on how the united states can maintain competitiveness while furthering decarbonization. reshoring manufacturing since 2020, investments in new manufacturing facilities have accelerated in the united states, driven by two key sectors :

the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new

users in the eu are likely to face higher prices and may start to look for alternative trading partners or require existing trading partners to reduce the carbon content of their products. multinationals may need to reconsider their offshoring and sourcing strategies in the light of the changing dynamics. the levies can be significant. for example, spain imported 14. 5 million tons of steel in 2022, half of which came from outside the eu. assuming an average carbon intensity of steel and the current eu carbon price, spanish steel importers could face annual tariffs of some 1 billion euros when cbam regulations are fully enforced in 2034. while the levies will initially apply only to a relatively small number of the most carbon intensive sectors, the scope of the cbam is likely to expand over time. however, companies do have some time to get ready, as there is a transitional phase until the end of 2025, followed by an eight year ramp up of the charges themselves. now

one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries,

opportunity for the parliament and the council of the eu to fine tune the mechanism and ensure its ultimate objectives can be fulfilled. as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam

sustainable future of europe ' s industry by dagmar dieterle the steel industry is facing a perfect storm : decarbonisation, competitive pressure, imports from outside eu and declining demand are presenting companies with immense challenges. tata steel nederland has set itself the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2045. in an interview with market steel, hans van den berg, ceo of tata steel nederland with its integrated site in ijmuiden in the netherlands, explains what political measures are needed at european level to support this transformation and why green innovations also depend on fair competition. market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? the transformation to carbon neutrality is complex. for tata steel this means transforming our production process while still producing steel in the traditional way and also maintaining the high quality standards. furthermore, it is also a political challenge. the transformation of european industry means facilitating the transformation of companies in transition like tata steel nederland for example through financial measures and faster permitting processes. at the same time, the right (framework) conditions need to be established : ensuring the necessary sufficient clean energy production, competitive network cost and also creating a market for clean products like green steel. all in a european level playing field situation, also on (energy) taxation and exemptions. this happens in a challenging context, where the european steel industry is facing significant pressures due to competition from third countries especially our strategic rivals. market steel : what do you see as the biggest challenges to decarbonization, and how could european policymakers help to address them ? given the challenges faced by the entire european steel industry, the european commission needs to

economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive

mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia)
