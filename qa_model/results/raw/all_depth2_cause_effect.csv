"" we bring transparency to complex supply chains across a broad range of industries. oracle blockchain platform is a critical component within our solutions that enable clients to transparently record and share the origins and material journeys of raw materials. this helps prevent unethically sourced minerals from being included in supply chains and helps upstream miners who invest in setting higher bars of sustainable and responsible production to get rewarded in the marketplace. "" business challenges the essential global shift to an electrified and digital future has placed unprecedented demand for critical minerals used in the production of a vast array of products, including solar panels, consumer electronics, and electric vehicles (ev). meanwhile, the complex geopolitical landscape, has motivated many organizations to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers and source these minerals closer to home or with allied countries. historically, acquisition of critical minerals has left a trail of human rights violations and environmental devastation. in addition, the related mining, refining, and manufacturing processes create significant ghg emissions concerns, which can only be addressed when there ' s transparency and data sharing from many supply chain participants. consequently, companies along these complex industrial supply chains are experiencing increased pressure from governments, consumers, and internal stakeholders to ensure ethical and sustainable sourcing of raw materials and provide end to end visibility of production, including scope 3 ghg emissions. circulor was formed in 2017 with the mission to offer a digital platform that enables clients to continuously monitor upstream supply chain activity that they inherit. circulor ' s solutions replace cumbersome, periodic, paper based practices with continuous, tamper proof digital monitoring"
