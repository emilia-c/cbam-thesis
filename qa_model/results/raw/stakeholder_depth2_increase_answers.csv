from small and medium sized enterprises (smes) to heavy industry, they are responsible for the goods, services, and jobs that underpin our society. companies have always adapted to change, and the transition to net zero is no exception. decarbonising our economy is a huge task : done well, it offers businesses the opportunity to future proof operations, save on energy costs, and play a crucial role in the frontline battle to lower emissions. the urgent need to tackle climate change presents a significant business opportunity for organizations of all shapes and sizes. investing in the clean energy transition and achieving the uk ' s net zero ambition is a significant path for economic growth for the uk, with our gross domestic product (gdp) set to be 6. 4 % higher in 2050 if we pursue an accelerated transition. harnessing the benefits of the green industrial revolution will ensure the uk remains globally competitive and ensure we are well placed to lead internationally in low carbon products and services. it will also make businesses more resilient, shielding them from volatile fossil fuel prices. coal from british collieries once was the uk ' s dominant energy source, but clean homegrown energy from technologies such as wind and solar will power the low carbon industries of the future. realising these benefits rests on the ability of the energy and business sectors to work together to accelerate the transition. the uk has an abundant resource of clean electricity that can help reduce energy bills and make products manufactured here some of the lowest carbon goods in the

international trade. with countries around the world integrating climate considerations into their trade policies, the united states is under growing pressure to develop and implement its own cbam. this policy tool, already adopted by the european union, is geared toward leveling the playing field for domestic industries while promoting global climate action and accountability. a future u. s. cbam could serve as a vital instrument in the nation ' s transition toward a net zero economy, encouraging domestic carbon footprint reduction and driving trading partners to adopt cleaner practices. however, crafting and rolling out such a mechanism comes with knotty challenges, ranging from choosing optimal carbon accounting methods and pricing to warding off potential trade disputes and garnering global collaboration. as the united states charts its course through this complex policy landscape, it has the opportunity to shape global climate action while safeguarding its economic interests. as the world ' s largest crude oil producer and liquefied natural gas exporter and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (ghgs), the united states bears a substantial responsibility to address global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. the nation ' s pivotal role in the transition toward clean energy is underscored by the significant steps it has taken to reduce energy related co2 emissions and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. while the united states has implemented reforms to reduce ghg emissions, many other major economies are also taking bold actions to combat climate change and align their trade and climate policies in a bid to avert a climate crisis. the european union ' s fit for 55 proposals have focused on achieving significant net reductions in ghg emissions and addressing concerns over carbon leakage from imports. underscoring its commitment to contain carbon emissions at home and abroad, the european union rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in october 2023 to protect the competitiveness of local industry and encourage other countries to reduce their carbon footprint through clean industrial investment.

the euemissions trading system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has

requires waterproof carbon leakage measures ~ a af "" vi ao ah ~ a = why a carbon border measure needs to complement temporarily free allocation and indirect costs compensation in the transition towards climate neutrality this paper clarifies the reasons why it is appropriate from environmental, economic and legal perspectives to implement initially a carbon border measure as a complementary provision in addition to the existing carbon leakage measures. the eu green deal is a landmark for the eu leadership in the international fight to climate change. the green deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short term ones for 2030. considering the current intended nationally determined contributions (indcs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. this trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the paris agreement need to submit their final ndcs as well as their mid century strategies. in this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of eu climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in europe. this will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of eu leadership in climate ambition. due to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. as recognised in the 2018 commission communication "" a clean planet for all "" as well as in the 2015 impact assessment accompanying the commission proposal on the post 2020 eu ets directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment. the green deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, "" either because production is transferred from the eu to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because eu products are replaced by more carbon intensive imports \'. as long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the eu legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term. while free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an

works on the "" cap and trade "" principle. this means that there is a limit on the total amount of certain ghg emissions that can be emitted by the industry. with the revision, the eu aims to lower the overall emission cap even further and increase its annual rate of emission reduction. elements of the package that are most relevant for the fertilizer industry include the reform of the emission trading scheme, the carbon border adjustment mechanism and the revision of the renewable energy directive. under the eu emissions trading scheme, an industry exposed to risk of carbon leakage is entitled to free co, allowances up to a benchmark based on the average emissions of the best 10 % of the industry \' s installations. fertilizers have two specific benchmarks : ammonia and nitric acid. free allocations only covers a part of the huge ets costs faced by the fertilizers industry (cfr table). the exponential increase of ets allowances price in the past two years, together with the increased ets ambition, will result in an additional burden for the fertilizers industry. the european fertilizer industry supports the eu green deal objectives and has therefore been advocating for a responsible and coherent legislative framework that will balance climate ambitions with industry competitiveness. the eu ets has been driving the emission abatement of the fertilizer industry, leading

possible to reducing co2 emissions in a way that is administratively manageable and causes as little trade friction as possible. in particular this means : any mechanism will have to be wto compatible

replaces the current system of free allowances, the eu export competitiveness to third markets must be addressed. the mechanism should apply both to direct and indirect emissions from electricity use, as the latter is an increasing part of the production costs. the revenue collected should be used to fight climate change. this will strengthen the climate profile of the mechanism and further reduce

slightly on top of the eu emissions trading system currently in place. an eu carbon price of usd 88 on all emissions reduces emissions by 21 %, and the introduction of the cbam only adds another 1. 3 percentage points. modelling suggests that the eu cbam could cost developing countries usd 10. 2 billion, with some countries, like zimbabwe and india, most exposed. the introduction of the eu cbam has led to the announcement of more climate and international trade measures worldwide as countries try to limit their exposure to it. thus far, this has resulted in an uncoordinated and confusing policy landscape. to ensure that climate and trade policies work to reduce global emissions, they should be aligned with unfccc principles and should provide exemptions to avoid placing additional burdens on developing countries. a carbon border adjustment mechanism is a carbon tariff on imports a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a policy that charges a carbon price on certain types

when a carbon price is put in place, the higher prices for carbon intensive domestic goods do not lead to more imports of cheap, carbon intensive goods from countries where carbon taxes are not in place. it aims to prevent \' carbon leakage \', where carbon intensive activities are moved to another location with less regulation on emissions, instead of being reduced, resulting in no overall decrease in emissions. in the absence of domestic carbon pricing, a cbam functions as a border tariff targeting carbon intensive production and is not likely to contribute to further emissions reductions. eu cbam has sparked discussions on climate and trade this has led to a wide range of reactions from different countries, including the development of new cbams and other trade policies, as

cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains

to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a

measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the

considered at eu level. however, the devil is in the details, and in this context svemin would like to highlight certain key aspects that need to be addressed in the design of a cbam : climate transition and competitiveness must go hand in hand. it is crucial that in the transition to become climate neutral, the industry can maintain and even improve competitiveness. a cbam must be designed with the overall objective to contribute efficiently to reducing co2 emissions in a way that is administratively manageable for companies and causes as little trade friction as possible. it is crucial that the risk of carbon leakage for companies with export to third countries is addressed. the carbon and investment leakage that we already see today, i. e. that investments are prioritized in other countries with lower climate ambitions and higher co2 emissions in production, must be addressed. this leakage is likely to increase over time if the eu increases its climate ambitions while other countries do not. therefore, if the instrument of free allowances in the eu ets is not compatible with a cbam, another instrument that tackles the risk of carbon leakage must be developed. the indirect costs for industry of a higher electricity price need to be taken into account. the mining and minerals industry in sweden has adopted a roadmap in order to reach fossil free mining operations by 2035 and climate neutral metals and mineral processing by 2045. in order to reach these climate targets, electrification is key. this requires access to fossil free electricity at

adjustment mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu

the character of cbam ambiguous. using the cbam revenue for new climate protection measures in developing countries with particular needs improves its legitimacy as a permissible arrangement under

vulnerable communities and the eu that revenues from such systems are used for climate action rather than for allowing public expenditure reductions. channelling cbam revenue for support to developing countries is necessary also because the system imposes several kinds of costs on third countries, such as ; the price that should be paid for greenhouse gas emissions, the costs of the considerable administrative work required for compliance (calculation of emissions, reporting, verification), losses of export revenue when goods is rendered uncompetitive, costs of necessary investments to regain competitiveness. countries and producers with the ability to shoulder costs for reducing their emissions should do so and can rightly be penalised if they fail to meet requirements. the same does not

transitional reporting obligations for eu importers of cbam goods, as well as the transitional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of cbam goods. in the cbam ' s transitional phase, traders will only have to report on the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism without paying any financial adjustment. this will give adequate time for businesses to prepare in a predictable manner, while also allowing for the definitive methodology to be fine tuned by 2026. to help both importers and third country producers, the commission also published today guidance for eu importers and non eu installations on the practical implementation of the new rules. at the same time, dedicated it tools to help importers perform and report these calculations are currently being developed, as well as training materials, webinars and tutorials to support businesses when the transitional mechanism begins. while importers will be asked to collect fourth quarter data as of 1 october 2023, their first report will only have to be submitted by 31 january 2024. ahead of its adoption by the commission, the implementing regulation was subject

sharing of environmental and social sustainability efficacy, which supports the demands for transparency and confirmation of ethical practices within mining and steel manufacturing supply chains. the steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent blockchain network, stakeholders in the steel recycling process can be connected and have real time visibility into the entire supply chain', 'reference': '817', 'full_answer': 'in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply

steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent blockchain network, stakeholders in the

circular supply chain makes this possible by radically changing how we produce and use products. it is a system where waste is a thing of the past and resources are utilized optimally. from reuse to recycling, this model offers enormous benefits for both the environment and business results. let ' s see how this works. what is a circular supply chain ? in a circular supply chain, products, components, and materials are continuously reused in a closed loop approach. think of a company that takes back used products, refurbishes them, and resells them instead of discarding them. this extends the product ' s lifespan, reduces the need for new raw materials, and minimizes environmental impact. an example is philips, which takes back old medical equipment, refurbishes it, and reintroduces it to the market circular vs. closed loop supply chain although ' circular ' and ' closed loop ' are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference. a closed loop supply chain focuses on recycling materials within the chain to minimize waste. circular goes further and encompasses the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to end of life. imagine a thrift store versus a product designer who considers reuse and recycling from the start. linear supply chain the opposite of a circular supply chain is a linear supply chain. the raw materials are sourced, produced, used, and discarded. while most companies currently operate their supply chain as a linear flow of goods, recycling companies and second hand dealers and shops take their linear products and try to reuse them. it is crucial to learn that having a linear organization does not mean that your product is also used linearly. creating a circular supply chain creating it requires a holistic approach that involves all stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. the process involves four key steps : design for sustainability : the first step is to design products with sustainability in mind, considering the entire product lifecycle and its environmental impact. optimize resource utilization : the next step is to optimize resource utilization by reducing waste and maximizing renewable sources. implement reverse logistics : the third step is reverse logistics, where products are collected and returned to the supply chain for refurbishment, remanufacturing, or

creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a long term vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalization have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating cross border in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, start ups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade cross border. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in the long term, today \' s communication presents a plan for a new framework for business taxation in the eu, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax

targets, the industry will have to make fundamental changes to its production processes. two possible solutions immediately come to mind : capturing the co2 produced by traditional steel plants and repurposing it or storing it underground, or closing existing plants and building new ones that operate initially on natural gas and eventually on green hydrogen. the industry has considered such changes for years, and a few companies are piloting production of low carbon, hydrogen based steel in small volumes. beyond that, however, little progress has been made, primarily because the two possible solutions are enormously expensive and would hike the price of steel by as much as 50 %. that may seem unpalatable in a commodity industry with extremely low margins to begin with. but the alternative will be increasingly costly as well. approved or anticipated global regulatory changes aimed at reaching carbon neutrality in the next 30 to 40 years will translate into ever mounting carbon costs for steel companies that continue to use traditional processes. europe is leading the way in regulatory reform, targeting a 55 % reduction in carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, primarily through so called market based measures, which require steel producers to pay for each metric ton of co2 emitted. in addition, the eu will soon introduce the innovative carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), essentially a tariff on steel imports based on the amount of carbon embedded in them. simultaneously, chinaby far the largest steel producing countryis seeking carbon neutrality by 2060 and is also in the process of introducing a national carbon pricing system. the first emissions trading started in 2021 in the power sector and is expected to expand to include the steel sector in the coming years. given the sheer size of chinese steel output, even a small percentage shift toward green steel production would bring large quantities to the market. this could alter trade balances significantly because a lot of this chinese steel would serve to meet the increasing demand for green products in europe. weighing all of the decarbonization trends roiling the steel

recep batu, prof. dr. etem karakaya from the eskiehir osmangazi university faculty of economics and administrative sciences, department of economics, shared insights on the economic aspects and solution proposals. additionally, dr. mahfi eilmez offered his assessments in the economic field. expressing his thoughts at the sustainable future in exports adana meeting, garanti bbva general manager recep batu stated, "" i want to emphasize that the climate crisis is intensifying every day as a critical issue. it is our collective responsibility to take action before the situation deteriorates further and to make the world a better place to live. in this context, the european green deal provides a significant roadmap. regarding the economic aspect, the carbon border adjustment mechanism is a crucial factor that will alter trade rules. the financial implications of this process will take effect on january 1,2026, when carbon credits will start being purchased. thus, we have limited time to adapt to this process. additionally, beyond the cbam, there will be various eu standards that will necessitate rapid changes in our production techniques. consequently, the importance of producing goods that are durable, recyclable, and have a low carbon footprint is increasing. unfortunately, exporters who do not comply with these specified criteria will fall behind in the competition. we need to be prepared now. ukurova region significantly contributes to our national economy with its production capacity, organized industrial zones, and industrial estates. this is why

electrification, ultimately reliant on renewable energy sources. this transition will require a substantial increase in renewable capacity to meet future industrial needs. table of contents executive summary green electrification of industries is a necessary lever for india ' s clean energy story electrifying thermal processes with renewables is a natural choice for indian industries to slash their carbon footprint while simultaneously boosting the country ' s clean energy ecosystem. industries are the largest energy end use sector in india, emitting 920 million tonnes of co2 annually. the steel and cement industries alone contribute 18 % of india ' s total emissions. with the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) legislation, there is increasing focus on decarbonising industrial energy use. understanding the ' hard to abate ' nature of industries and exploring available options is crucial for initiating decarbonization. in the near term (to 2030), transitioning from fossil fuel based electricity to renewable energy sources (res) is crucial to meet current power needs sustainably. in the long term (to 2050), industries must adopt advanced electrification and power to fuel technologies to rapidly decarbonise their emission intensive operations. green electrification will significantly change energy consumption patterns in these industries, requiring strategic planning to ensure future energy demands are met efficiently. key takeaways renewable energy can decarbonise up to 11 % of india ' s heavy industries ' current energy consumption industries rely on fossil fuel and electricity for their heat and power requirements, respectively. in 2022, india ' s heavy industriessteel, cement, aluminium, petrochemicals and ammoniaconsumed a total of 175

significantly reduce industrial emissions and ensure compliance with international norms like the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). india ' s heavy industries require 120 gw of renewables by 2030 to fully decarbonise their electricity demand by 2030, electricity demand in india ' s heavy industries is expected to rise by 45 % to reach 253 twh, driven by existing technologies and projected

eu. he eu has decided to impose a carbon tax known as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), effective from january 1,2026, on the import of 7 carbon intensive sectors including : steel products iron and iron ore concentrates cement aluminum products fertiliser hydrogen electrical energy. most consider cbam as "" discriminatory "" and a "" trade barrier "" that would hit not only indian exports but also those of many other developing nations. the tariff is as high as 20-35 % on imports of these high carbon goods. to fully decarbonise their electricity use and remain competitive in the global market, india \' s heavy industries require 120 gw of dedicated renewable energy capacity by 2030. the report focuses on the steel, cement, petrochemicals, aluminum and ammonia sectors. decarbonising these emission intensive "" heavy "" industries can significantly benefit both india \' s industrial sector and renewable energy ecosystem. currently, 11 % of energy consumption in these heavy industries comes from electricity, with the rest from fossil fuel based thermal energy. based on industry growth projections, electricity demand for heavy industries is expected to rise by 45 %. meeting this increased demand with renewable energy could help to avoid 180 million tons (mt) of co2, equivalent to the total annual emission of the netherland. duttatreya

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

that the mechanism could violate wto rules, increase the cost of goods for consumers, and disproportionately affect developing countries. difficulties meeting deadlines as the details of its implementation start to emerge, the mandatory reporting deadline draws closer. effective october 1, the obligated party, meaning the importer, must submit information related to each quarter one month

differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea

the carbon and investment leakage that we already see today, i. e. that investments are prioritized in other countries with lower climate ambitions and higher co2 emissions in production, must be addressed. this leakage is likely to increase over time if the eu increases its climate ambitions while other countries do not. therefore, if the instrument of free allowances in the eu ets is not

against climate change. however, if measures are unilateral, europe risks having a limited impact on global reductions in ghg emission, while damaging the competitiveness of its domestic industrial

climate mitigation. the objective of this mechanism is to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports while ensuring that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less stringent policies. nitrogen fertilizer producers are among sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage due to the industry ' s emission intensity and exposure to international trade. the european fertilizer industry therefore welcomed the european commission ' s initiative to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism., but, since the beginning, underlined that for the fertilizer sector cbam would only work if eu ets free allocations at full benchmark level were maintained at least till 2030 and if cbam would also foresee a solution for the export part of the production. a well designed cbam could be particularly important for the sector since already today the main european fertilizer products have a climate footprint that is typically half of the global average. an effective and well designed cbam should aim at avoiding the replacement of ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers produced in europe with imports from countries with a worse carbon footprint while at the same time allowing the transformation of the industry toward a zero carbon production. fertilizers europe is therefore advocating for the cbam designed as a reinforcement of current carbon leakage measures with the stepped up climate ambition. why do we need an equal treatment between the ets and cbam sectors achieving a higher level of emission reduction ambition, requires mechanisms to strenghten carbon leakage protection and minimise negative impact on exports. complementarity of cbam with free allocation is key to protect value chains, mitigate the impact on trade flows and provide certainties for low carbon investments. cbam, and the current system of ets free allocations, should aim to effectively support the industry in

emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact

typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the border, to steel imported from', 'reference':

reported a 300 % five year increase in third country cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92m worth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism

what is the cap and trade mechanism ? which gases and sectors are covered by it ? and how does it contribute to the eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in 2020 and is set to enforce a 62 % reduction by 2030. as part of the eu ' fit for 55 package ' the eu ets was revised to align it with the eu ' s overall objective of reducing net emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990"", 'reference': '990', 'full_answer': 'by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions.', 'sentence_beginning': ' by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'of 18 percentage points', 'confidence': np.float32(0.003034641), 'start': np.int64(470), 'end': np.int64(472), 'context': '1. what is the euemissions trading system ?

wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free allocations were always expected to phase out in a mirror image of the cbam phase in. the proposal eventually adopted on 22 june 2022 set the end date for both as 2032. in 2020, the eu imported us $ 383m worth of cement and concrete

to prevent carbon leakage from domestic energy intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price-on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs

domestic energy intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price-on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs of the covered sectors in europe and internationally. by addressing the risk of carbon leakage, the cbam aims to safeguard the reduction of global emissions within its scope. though the ultimate objective of the cbam is to cover a wide range of products, the current proposal covers a limited number of sectors deemed to be at high risk of carbon leakage and for which the introduction of the measure is

border adjustment mechanism (cbam). it forms part of the european commission ' s fit for 55 package of climate policies which aims to lower eu emissions by 55 % by 2030. the cbam will complement the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) which imposes a price on in scope industries for emitting greenhouse gases. so far, however, much of the ets ' s effect has been diluted by the allocation of so called free allowances which means that, even if a company falls within the scope of the ets, it does not have to pay. this is so as to prevent ' carbon leakage ', meaning de industrialisation caused by an exodus of european companies to jurisdictions with less stringent climate policies. as free allowances are gradually being phased out, there was thus a need for a new policy to prevent carbon leakage : the cbam is the european commission ' s solution to this problem (european commission, n. d.). approved by the european council and parliament in may, it works by imposing a carbon tax equivalent to the ets carbon price on (specified) imports from non eu countries with less ambitious climate policies. the european commission hopes to thereby mitigate the competitive disadvantage that european industry faces due to the ets while simultaneously achieve a ' brussels effect ', spreading green targets around the globe by leveraging the european market ' s attractiveness (ibid.). the cbam comes at a time of heightened international trade tensions triggered by covid 19 and exacerbated by russia ' s war in ukraine (bukowsky, 2022). since its inception, it has been facing criticisms of protectionism under the pretence of climate policy (ibid.). foremost among accusations are that the cbam is not compliant with wto rules regarding non discrimination (appunn & wettengel, 2023) and that it may have devastating consequences for developing countries which have less fiscal space to invest in greening their industries but also bear less historical responsibility for climate change (lse, 2023). much ink has been spilled discussing either of these issues ; i will therefore not focus on them here but instead take the european commission which has denied allegations

to its potential to infringe on the principles of non discrimination and most favored nation treatment upheld by the world trade organization (wto). what is it, and how does it work ? the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is an initiative proposed by the european union (eu) to put a price on the carbon emitted while producing carbon intensive goods that enter the eu from countries lacking comparable carbon pricing systems. in principle, the goal of the cbam is to level the playing field for companies and discourage shifting emissions to countries with less stringent climate policies. however, since its inception, the cbam has been criticized by different global players, as they argue that the mechanism could violate wto rules, increase the cost of goods for consumers, and disproportionately affect developing countries. difficulties meeting deadlines as the details of its implementation start to emerge, the mandatory reporting deadline draws closer. effective october 1, the obligated party, meaning the importer, must submit information related to each quarter one month behind schedule. in addition to data relating to specific \' product \'-related co2 emissions (classified by tariff code), the information required includes the percentage of waste byproducts, the chemical composition of the steel, and any co2 emissions charges that may have been

less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for

discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its

possible to decarbonise the versatile alloy. hybrit, a consortium consisting of vattenfall, steel producer ssab and miner lkab, produced the first ever fossil fuel free steel using green hydrogen. hybrit ' s aspiration is not unique. driven by the steel zero initiative, set up in 2020 by the climate group to drive action to decarbonise the sector, key industry stakeholders have made a flurry of commitments and investments to reach this milestone by 2050. industry momentum is expected to continue in 2022 with the first industrial pilot projects expected by the middle of the decade. around 71 per cent of steel produced today comes from an iron ore based method. this typically uses a blast furnace at temperatures of around 1,500c in which carbon, usually coal, is used to remove oxygen and impurities from the ore to make pig iron. the latter is then turned into steel via a basic oxygen furnace whereby oxygen is blown onto the liquid iron to burn unwanted elements. the other 29 per cent is made using scrap and electric arc furnaces (eaf), which use an electrical current to melt scrap steel. this is on average 25 per cent less carbon intensive than the other method. steel producers are considering several ways to decarbonise these processes. at the hybrit pilot plant in lule, sweden, engineers opted to replace the blast furnace process with a ' direct reduction ' that uses hydrogen made from water and renewable electricity to reduce iron ore pellets manufactured by llkb without fossil fuels to sponge iron, which is then turned into steel. the temperature needed for the reduction process is much lower than in the blast furnace and produces only water vapor as a by product, removing 90 per cent of co2 emissions. the technique is powered by energy from the national grid, which in sweden is largely fossil free, consisting mostly of hydro and wind power. ssab hope to turn their research into a full scale pilot plant by 2026. newcomer h2 green steel (h2gs), which

for energy and infrastructure projects in the uk, who would be importers under the cbam regime, the proposals present a number of practical challenges. these include : the implicit cost of compliance with the reporting, registration and verification requirements under the regime could be high and particularly punitive for smaller projects, particularly in nascent markets. as importers only get the benefit of choosing green imports if they follow the verified emissions processes, there is a cost benefit analysis for projects to undertake ; does the cost of green imports and compliance outweigh the cost of sourcing from the eu market, or the costs of sourcing less green alternatives ? the regime potentially introduces additional regulatory and technology risks, which may be hard to accommodate in new energy and infrastructure sectors that already involve high levels of such risks. for example, if a project ultimately incorrectly estimates the expected embedded emissions of its imports, there will be additional costs and penalties to pay. this is a greater risk for less mature green technologies. project parties will need to develop or acquire skills in buying and selling certificates in an optimal way. although"", 'reference': '727', 'full_answer': 'the removal of free allowances for eu producers of these materials will also increase project costs over time (unless offset by other technological advances and government subsidies).', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': ' of these materials will also increase project costs over time (unless offset by other technological advances and government subsidies).', 'similarity_score': 0.7446026802062988}, {'answer': 'excessive regulation and high energy prices', 'confidence': np.float32(0.0007219369), 'start': np.int64(9), 'end': np.int64(14), 'context': ""excessive regulation and high energy prices contribute to second consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knock on effects on technology industries that supply components to the automotive sector. conclusion orgalim ' s autumn 2024 economics & statistics report presents a sobering view of the challenges facing europe ' s technology industries. the combination of weak demand, burdensome overregulation, high energy prices and structural labor issues continues to hinder growth. without"", 'reference': '1072', 'full_answer': ""excessive regulation and high energy prices contribute to second consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4."", 'sentence_beginning': '', 'sentence_end': "" contribute to second consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4."", 'similarity_score': 0.0}]",high energy costs

begins to recover, reasonable pricing for steel is vital for the construction industry european construction equipment manufacturers, and more in general downstream steel users, have been facing higher prices of steel products in the second half of 2020 as well as in the first quarter of 2021. they call for an end of the steel safeguard measures to ensure a competitive steel market and favorable market conditions. the main reason for the price surge seems to be a supply demand imbalance in the european steel market. on the one hand demand for steel from the eu industry has risen as a consequence of the economic recovery. on the other hand, supply could not meet demand due to a reduction in domestic as well as imported steel production. whereas the reduction in domestic production has been intensified by the covid 19 outbreak, the reduction in imported steel is a consequences of certain eu trade measures, in particular the steel safeguard measures. steel safeguard measures safeguards are trade measures meant for situations in which an industry is affected by an unforeseen, sharp and sudden increase of imports causing (or threatening) serious injury to domestic industry. the eu steel safeguard measures were introduced as part of the european union ' s response to the 2018 decision by the united states to impose tariffs on steel products on national security grounds. until 2018, imports of steel products into the eu increased sharply against a background of a persistent overcapacity in the global steel market and unfair trade practices by certain trading partners. the eu investigation found that us tariffs on steel were causing a diversion of trade flows into the eu. for this reason, the eu has deemed it necessary to protect eu steelmakers against excessive imports with safeguard measures. the eu safeguard measures concern 26 steel product categories imported from a list of developing countries and take the form of tariff rate quotas (' trqs ') per country, above which a 25 % duty is levied on imports. the safeguard measures were imposed in july 2018 for a period until 30 june 2021. following a request of 12 eu member states the commission initiated an investigation in february this year to assess whether the safeguard measures should be extended beyond 30 june 2021. the investigation will be concluded by the expiry date of the existing safeguard measures on 30 june 2021. gloomy outlook for steel downstream users it must be recognized that the steel safeguard measures have not had the effect of increasing the steel production

opportunity for those that move quickly to implement fundamental process changes and begin the transition to carbon neutrality. as regulatory, investor, and consumer pressures amplify the urgency for industrial decarbonization, the steel industry faces increasing demands for real plans to reduce emissions. that ' s not an easy task. to meet significant co2 reduction targets, the industry will have to make fundamental changes to its production processes. two possible solutions immediately come to mind : capturing the co2 produced by traditional steel plants and repurposing it or storing it underground, or closing existing plants and building new ones that operate initially on natural gas and eventually on green hydrogen. the industry has considered such changes for years, and a few companies are piloting production of low carbon, hydrogen based steel in small volumes. beyond that, however, little progress has been made, primarily because the two possible solutions are enormously expensive and would hike the price of steel by as much as 50 %. that may seem unpalatable in a commodity industry with extremely low margins to begin with. but the alternative will be increasingly costly as well. approved or anticipated global regulatory changes aimed at reaching carbon neutrality in the next 30 to 40 years will translate into ever mounting carbon costs for steel companies that continue to use traditional processes. europe is leading the way in regulatory reform, targeting a 55 % reduction in carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, primarily through so called market based measures, which require steel producers to pay for each metric ton of co2 emitted. in addition, the eu will soon introduce the innovative carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), essentially a tariff on steel imports based on the amount of carbon embedded in them. simultaneously, chinaby far the largest steel producing countryis seeking carbon neutrality by 2060 and is also in the process of introducing a national carbon pricing system. the first emissions trading started in 2021 in the power sector and is expected to expand to include the steel sector in the coming years. given the sheer size of chinese steel output, even a small percentage shift toward green steel production would bring large quantities to the market. this could alter trade balances significantly because a lot

extruders, rollers, foundry casters, manufacturers of aluminium parts and components ; primary aluminium (pa) : producers of unwrought metal that are split into two subcategories : 1) smelters, which transform alumina into pa ; and 2) refiners and re melters, which produce secondary recycled aluminium from scraps ; the global aluminium demand, supplied by primary and recycled metal sources, is

norton lorenz ' s most famous butterfly effect rests on the notion that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a

the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries, employment will also suffer. it is likely that certain european manufacturing sites will close to be ultimately relocated in non eu countries. according to a study conducted by"", 'reference': '178', 'full_answer': 'if

"" what the commission says is \' fit for 55 \' is unfit for our planet and unfair to society. without a fossil fuel phase out, the fuel industry will pass on emission costs for buildings and

and agriculture, are still excluded from the effort required to contribute to climate neutrality by using all the options already available today. the targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency are far below the level of ambition needed to keep global warming below 1. 5c and they are not binding at national level. this will delay the energy transition in the member states, since the current eu climate and energy governance framework has proven insufficient to fill the gap. the court of auditors recently unearthed a worrying trend whereby public money is often spent to cover

move quickly to implement fundamental process changes and begin the transition to carbon neutrality. as regulatory, investor, and consumer pressures amplify the urgency for industrial decarbonization, the steel industry faces increasing demands for real plans to reduce emissions. that ' s not an easy task. to meet significant co2 reduction targets, the industry will have to make fundamental changes to its production processes. two possible solutions immediately come to mind : capturing the co2 produced by traditional steel plants and repurposing it or storing it underground, or closing existing plants and building new ones that operate initially on natural gas and eventually on green hydrogen. the industry has considered such changes for years, and a few companies are piloting production of low carbon, hydrogen based steel in small volumes. beyond that, however, little progress has been made, primarily because the two possible solutions are enormously expensive and would hike the price of steel by as much as 50 %. that may seem unpalatable in a commodity industry with extremely low margins to begin with. but the alternative will be increasingly costly as well. approved or anticipated global regulatory changes aimed at reaching carbon neutrality in the next 30 to 40 years will translate into ever mounting carbon costs for steel companies that continue to use traditional processes. europe is leading the way in regulatory reform, targeting a 55 % reduction in carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, primarily through so called market based measures, which require steel producers to pay for each metric ton of co2 emitted. in addition, the eu will soon introduce the innovative carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), essentially a tariff on steel imports based on the amount of carbon embedded in them. simultaneously, chinaby far the largest steel producing countryis seeking carbon neutrality by 2060 and is also in the process of introducing a national carbon pricing system. the first emissions trading started in 2021 in the power sector and is expected to expand to include the steel sector in the coming years. given the sheer size of chinese steel output, even a small percentage shift toward green steel production would bring large quantities to the market. this could alter trade balances significantly because a lot of this chinese steel would serve to meet the increasing demand for green products in europe. weighing all of the decarbonization trends roiling the steel industry, it is apparent that steel manufacturers must move quickly to

[ ] the measure should be commensurate with the internal eu carbon price. against the background of these policy objectives, eex sees the following key principles for the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism should it be implemented : key principles for a carbon border adjustment mechanism a carbon border adjustment mechanism should be as closely as possible integrated with the existing eu emissions trading scheme. the most straightforward way to do this would be the inclusion of imports in the eu ets as listed as an option in the inception impact assessment. importers would be required to surrender eu emission allowances for goods which they import to the eu. this policy approach has several significant advantages over alternatives, such as an import tax / tariff or product standards : an inclusion of imports in the eu ets would ensure full compatibility with carbon pricing in the eu and the existing energy and climate policy framework. the existing infrastructure of the eu ets could be used for implementation. the price importers pay would be fully transparent and equal to what eu producers are paying, providing a clear and easily comparable measure for their efforts. they could rely on the liquid and efficient eu emission market to manage their exposure. inclusion in the eu ets provides an optimal basis for increasing cooperation between jurisdictions. other regions would be encouraged to monitor and track emissions in line with the eu ets, increasing compatibility between different climate policy regimes globally. the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism for a sector has to be linked to a gradual phaseout of free allocation. the policy objective of such mechanism is to provide an alternative to free allocation and counter some its disadvantages. for reducing administrative complexity, any mechanism should use existing standards, infrastructure and common eu benchmarks already used today for policies to limit carbon leakage. a decrease in free allocation has to be matched with an increase in the auctioning share. auctioning is the default allocation method for allowances in the eu ets. it is the most transparent allocation method, providing a transparent, harmonised and non discriminatory process. the principle', 'reference': '1637', 'full_answer': 'inclusion in the eu ets provides an optimal

key gaps in eu ets system : allowing eu consumption to contribute to increased global emissions, while burdening eu producers with ets costs. at the same, by failing to incentivize foreign producers

objective is to encourage non eu producers to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, (b) eu carbon leakage avoidance schemes (mainly, free allowances) are not weakened, and (c) wto compatibility is ensured by keeping the system non discriminatory towards non eu exporters, as close to ets as possible, with solid reliance on gatt article xx where required. grupa azoty also believes that the fertilizer sector should be covered by the cbam for the following reasons : 1. eu fertilizer producers have already made significant contribution to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions, by practically eliminating n2o emissions and approaching technological limits for co2 process emissions from ammonia. 2. our sector has clearly paid the price for ets by suffering carbon leakage : exports are down, imports are up, eu companies are taken over by non eu producers from countries with no carbon pricing, investment in eu production is down with most new investments made outside of the european union (some of which are planned for exports to the eu). 3. main competitors of the eu fertilizer industry come from countries that have no price on carbon emissions. 4. eu market is attractive for non eu producers of fertilizers, hence introduction of cbam will encourage 3rd country producers to limit their own emissions. 5. it is simple to calculate emissions in the fertilizer sector, because they occur in only two points of production and most of emissions are directly related to consumption of key raw material. 6. most imports to the eu in our sector originate in a handful of countries, with a small number of producing exporters, making cbam manageable at the border. grupa azoty also welcomes the commission ' s decision to carry out a full impact assessment that

world. if cbam works as intended we can avoid carbon leakage and we have a level playing field in the eu. however, this is not enough for firms exporting out of the eu. hence, the issue of global competitiveness must be taken seriously. free allowances has been a useful instrument to mitigate the cost burden for firms in the ets. it should therefore be explored if, and if so how, the free allowances can co exist with cbam. if free allowances are replaced by cbam this will drive up costs for the affected sectors. furthermore, cbam can also lead to more expensive inputs for industries

week the commission presented the ' fit for 55 ' package, made of several legislative proposals in different areas and across several sectors to reduce eu emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990. the extension of the emission trading system (ets) to cover emissions from buildings and the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) to adjust and equalize the price of imports of steel and other carbon intensive materials with the eu domestic price are the most relevant elements of the ' fit for 55 ' package for the construction equipment industry. extension of the eu ets the eu emission trading system (ets) is the eu carbon market. it works on the ' cap and trade ' principle. a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases. the cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. within the cap, operators buy or receive emissions allowances. after each year, operators must surrender enough allowances to cover fully its emissions. if an installation reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. buildings account for 40 % of the total energy consumed and for 36 % of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. for this reason, the commission is proposing the extension of the ets to buildings as well as transport in order to significantly reduce emissions over time. the new obligations from the extension of the ets to buildings will regulate fuel suppliers, rather than households. the suppliers will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the quantity of fuels they place on the market and for surrendering emission allowances each calendar year depending on the carbon intensity of the fuels. the new system will become operational as of 2025, with a cap on emissions set from 2026, based on data collected under the effort sharing regulation. during the first year, fuel suppliers will be required to hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit and to report their emissions for 2024 and 2025. introduction of cbam the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been designed to prevent the risk of so called '

stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2', 'reference': '174',

of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive

european commission proposed a reform to the eu cbam to reduce compliance burdens while safeguarding climate goals as part of the clean industrial deal. key changes include exempting small importers by raising the de minimis threshold, streamlining reporting for larger importers, and delaying cbam certificate sales. despite these simplifications, the eu cbam ' s timeline remains unchanged. large importers of carbon intensive goods covered by cbam will have to consider the financial impact of the tax as soon as 1 january 2026. accurate carbon data collection and early preparation will be critical to managing costs in the evolving cross border trade landscape. we broke down all the changes and highlighted business implications below. core changes 1. threshold adjustment : who is covered ? under the new rules, companies importing less than 50 tonnes of cbam goods annually (or roughly 100t co2e) will be exempt from cbam reporting and fees. this change lifts the burden from 182, small and occasional importers, replacing the previously impractical 150 monetary value threshold. the new threshold still captures 99 % of imported embedded emissions, according to the commissions ' trade and carbon data analysis. authorities will review the weight based threshold annually to maintain this coverage. note : customs authorities will monitor trade data and flag importers at risk of exceeding the new de minimis threshold, ensuring all relevant companies report to the cbam registry. occasional importers near the threshold must still obtain cbam importer authorisation. 2. 2027 cbam certificate sale delay cbam certificates will go on sale in february 2027, a year later than previously announced. while importers will have to surrender their first batch of certificates in 2027, they should cover 2026 imports. surrendered certificates will reflect the 2026 quarterly average of eu ets prices. note : businesses will therefore gain an extra year to prepare, but they must still track and report emissions quarterly throughout 2026. early preparation remains key in avoiding financial surprises in 2027. the revised rules also lower the certificate holding requirement from 80 % to 50 % of embedded emissions per quarter, easing financial strain on importers. 3. extended reporting deadlines to give importers more time and flexibility in reporting, several elements of the timeline have been updated. cbam declarations will be due 31 august instead of 31 may previously the deadline for certificate resale will move from 30 june to 30 september 4. simplified emission

carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in the united states presents an intricate policy challenge at the intersection of climate action and international trade. with countries around the world integrating climate considerations into their trade policies, the united states is under growing pressure to develop and implement its own cbam. this policy tool, already adopted by the european union, is geared toward leveling the playing field for domestic industries while promoting global climate action and accountability. a future u. s. cbam could serve as a vital instrument in the nation ' s transition toward a net zero economy, encouraging domestic carbon footprint reduction and driving trading partners to adopt cleaner practices. however, crafting and rolling out such a mechanism comes with knotty challenges, ranging from choosing optimal carbon accounting methods and pricing to warding off potential trade disputes and garnering global collaboration. as the united states charts its course through this complex policy landscape, it has the opportunity to shape global climate action while safeguarding its economic interests. as the world ' s largest crude oil producer and liquefied natural gas exporter and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (ghgs), the united states bears a substantial responsibility to address global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. the nation ' s pivotal role in the transition toward clean energy is underscored by the significant steps it has taken to reduce energy related co2 emissions and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. while the united states has implemented reforms to reduce ghg emissions, many other major economies are also taking bold actions to combat climate change and align their trade and climate policies in a bid to avert a climate crisis. the european union ' s fit for 55 proposals have focused on achieving significant net reductions in ghg emissions and addressing concerns over carbon leakage from imports. underscoring its commitment to contain carbon emissions at home and abroad, the european union rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in october 2023 to protect the competitiveness of local industry and encourage other countries to reduce their carbon footprint through clean industrial investment. a cbam is a critical policy instrument that levels the playing

eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of

"" greenness "" has become a key determinant of competitiveness between nations. this is because the steel industry continues to receive some free allowances for its production. the gradual phase out

emission trading system (eu ets) what is the eu ets ? what is the cap and trade mechanism ? which gases and sectors are covered by it ? and how does it contribute to the eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in

sustainability laws : the csrd, csddd, eu taxonomy regulation, and cbam. the goal is to reduce the administrative burden on companiesespecially small and mid sized firmswhile maintaining the eu \' s environmental and social objectives. the package is a response to mounting criticism from businesses and political leaders who warned that the complexity and speed of new sustainability rules risked stifling competitiveness and investment. the commission, acknowledging this tension, now seeks to deliver on its green deal commitments "" in a smarter and less burdensome way. "" what is being simplified ? the omnibus package focuses on four key areas of sustainability regulation : 1. csrd (corporate sustainability reporting directive) requires large companies to report on environmental, social, and governance (esg) performance using standardized metrics (esrs). 2. csddd (corporate sustainability due diligence directive) mandates large firms to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights and environmental risks in their supply chains. 3. eu taxonomy regulation provides a classification system for sustainable economic activities, guiding companies and investors through disclosure requirements. 4. cbam (carbon border adjustment mechanism) imposes a carbon price on certain imports to prevent carbon leakage and ensure fair competition for eu producers. key changes introduced by the omnibus package 1. higher thresholds, fewer companies covered the threshold for csrd and eu taxonomy reporting has been raised from 250 to 1, employees, aligning with the csddd scope. this change excludes about 80 % of the companies that would have been subject to mandatory sustainability reporting, reducing the number from ~ 50, to ~ 10 ,. as a result, many medium sized and listed smes are no longer required to submit detailed esg disclosures. 2. simplified sustainability reporting (csrd) companies still subject to csrd will benefit from significantly streamlined esrs standards. the number of required data points is being reduced by around 70 %, with clearer instructions to reduce confusion and reporting fatigue. plans for industry specific standards have been scrapped. the assurance requirement will remain "" limited, "" avoiding more costly and intensive audits. a two year delay has been granted for many companies that were due to start reporting in 2026, now extended to 2028. 3. voluntary sme reporting standard the commission will provide a', 'reference': '357', 'full_answer': 'higher thresholds, fewer companies covered the threshold for csrd and eu taxonomy reporting has been raised from 250 to 1, employees, aligning with the csddd scope. this change excludes about 80 % of the companies that would have been subject to mandatory sustainability reporting, reducing the number from ~ 50, to ~ 10 ,. as a result, many medium sized and listed smes are no longer required to submit detailed esg disclosures. 2. simplified sustainability reporting (csrd) companies still subject to csrd will benefit from significantly streamlined esrs standards.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}]",poor alignment of reporting requirements with sustainability performance

presentation of her green deal for europe on 11 december 2019 that she would "" propose a co2 border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors in order to reduce the risk of carbon leakage "" \'. the system should ensure that import prices better reflect the cost of co2. according to wsm, comprehensive border adjustment measures could, under certain conditions, be suitable to compensate competitive disadvantages that eu companies face due to high climate protection standards. the risk of energy intensive industries or production migrating to regions with lower climate protection standards (carbon leakage) must be prevented at all costs. however, it must be ensured that free and rule based world trade, which is vital for the survival of the export oriented european industry, is not disturbed. border adjustment measures must therefore comply with wto rules and retaliatory measures by important trading partners must be ruled out. * european commission : "" communication

public consultation bellona europa strongly supports the efforts of the european commission to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as part of the eu green deal policy portfolio. as an ngo with decades of experience in the field of industrial decarbonization policies, we hold the view that in the current policy context, the cbam is a unique environmental policy instrument in the outcomes it encourages, such as the promotion of net zero industrial transformation, both within and outside the eu. the answers to the questionnaire provided by the european commission as part of its public consultation on the topic, are based on the vision and policy expertise outlined below, which includes technical considerations. a cbam is required to ensure the full effectiveness of europe ' s new sustainable growth strategy, the european green deal. as an environmental policy tool, with a trade and competitiveness dimension, it will enable the eu to take fuller responsibility for the carbon footprint of its imports as well as encouraging and incentivising increased climate ambition and robust monitoring and verification of emissions worldwide. the proposed cbam works as a guarantee of a responsible approach to the eu green deal, both for eu based industries and outside jurisdictions by providing a continuous incentive for ever lower emissions (with concrete economic savings in doing so). this can help increase worldwide climate ambition, or at the very minimum ensure that the eu green deal does not lead to emissions increasing elsewhere on the globe. secondly, a cbam will address the risks of carbon in a net zero by 2050 european union, ensuring a level playing field based on embedded carbon and indirect emissions, driving climate advancements in the eu while mindful of the need to curtail an increase in demand of high carbon goods and products elsewhere. this would be an enhancement from the current situation where disproportionate competitive advantages derive from differing carbon pricing landscapes across various jurisdictions. due to the incentives it provides for solid transformation of the industrial sectors towards a zero emissions landscape,

european commission to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as part of the eu green deal policy portfolio. as an ngo with decades of experience in the field of industrial decarbonization policies, we hold the view that in the current policy context, the cbam is a unique environmental policy instrument in the outcomes it encourages, such as the promotion of net zero industrial transformation, both within and outside the eu. the answers to the questionnaire provided by the european commission as part of its public consultation on the topic, are based on the vision and policy expertise outlined below, which includes technical considerations. a cbam is required to ensure the full effectiveness of europe ' s new sustainable growth strategy, the european green deal. as an environmental policy tool, with a trade and competitiveness dimension, it will enable the eu to take fuller responsibility for the carbon footprint of its imports as well as encouraging and incentivising increased climate ambition and robust monitoring and verification of emissions worldwide. the proposed cbam works as a guarantee of a responsible approach to the eu green deal, both for eu based industries and outside jurisdictions by providing a continuous incentive for ever lower emissions (with concrete economic savings in doing so). this can help increase worldwide climate ambition, or at the very minimum ensure that the eu green deal does not lead to emissions increasing elsewhere on the globe. secondly, a cbam will address the risks of carbon in a net zero by 2050 european union, ensuring a level playing field based on embedded carbon and indirect emissions, driving climate advancements in the eu while mindful of the need to curtail an increase in demand of high carbon goods and products elsewhere. this would be an enhancement from the current situation where disproportionate competitive advantages derive from differing carbon pricing landscapes across various jurisdictions. due to the incentives it provides for solid transformation of the industrial sectors towards a zero emissions landscape, there is no other policy mechanism that provides the same range of environmental benefits (as listed below). however, the cbam can work well in tandem with other additional policies to ensure the development of zero carbon products markets. bellona

changing before our eyes. we see dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape. this week alone, we saw a long standing strategic partner vote against a un resolution condemning russia ' s aggression against ukraine. we need to treat these developments as a call to action. the freedoms that we enjoy and the values that we cherish can no longer be taken for granted in a complex world. for the eu, they also depend on maintaining and further developing our economic base by adapting, innovating, and competing in the world. in short, we need to build a more competitive europe. earlier today, my colleagues presented the clean industrial deal and an action plan to bring down energy prices as part of that effort. cutting red tape is another important element to achieve more competitive europe. put simply, we cannot hope or expect to successfully compete in a perilous world with one hand tied behind our backs. the past five years have been a period of intense regulatory activity. while our commitment to securing the green transition has not wavered, we must acknowledge that this has come at a cost, generating a large regulatory burden on people and businesses. as we take stock, we see that this accumulation of rules, and their increased complexity, are limiting our economic potential and our prosperity. today, regulation is seen by more than 60 % of eu companies as an obstacle to investment. 55 % of smes flagging regulatory obstacles and administrative burdens as their greatest challenge. in europe, small and medium sized enterprises (smes) constitute approximately 99 % of all businesses. they are most at risk of being suffocated by administrative burdens. they are europe ' s economic engine, for whom we are speaking and acting with today ' s proposals. i also want to be very clear that we remain deeply committed to building a greener and fairer society and economy. simplification is about making sure that eu rules help deliver rather than impede the achievement of our economic, social, environmental and security goals. it is about achieving those goals in a smarter and less burdensome way. less bureaucracy means more innovation and investment [ that will secure our long term prosperity. ] it means creating new and quality jobs for european workers. it provides citizens with the opportunity to stay, live and work in any region of europe, from portugal to

industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knock on effects on technology industries that supply components to the automotive sector. conclusion orgalim ' s autumn 2024 economics &

in 2025. what should chemical companies prepare for in the coming year ? let ' s explore the top developments that are shaping the industry landscape. the chemical sector will see ongoing consolidation through mergers, acquisitions, and portfolio restructuring. already, major players are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on emerging opportunities. in 2024, basf launched a separate catalyst business, basf environmental catalyst and metal solutions, to serve customers in the hydrogen economy. sudarshan chemicals acquired heubach in october 2024, diversifying

expect more consolidation for 2025. chemical companies are feeling the pressure of cost increases. feedstock and energy prices particularly remain a significant concern, with european gas prices still four times higher than in the u. s. capacity constraints, fluctuating demand, and geopolitical factors like new tariffs under the trump administration could also greatly impact profitability in chemical sectors. to navigate these challenges, companies must reevaluate their operations and seek innovative, cost effective solutions to sustain momentum. the industry is shifting toward regionalized or localized production to ensure supply chain resilience. nearshoring and friendshoring are becoming more of a priority as companies seek to mitigate geopolitical risks, cut costs, and reduce transportation emissions. this trend brings opportunities for chemical suppliers to develop strong regional partnerships and optimize their distribution networks. customers are prioritizing sustainability, traceability, and esg (environmental, social, and governance) factors in their purchasing decisions, causing chemical companies to adapt their product portfolios and manufacturing processes to meet these demands. while challenging, this shift creates opportunities for innovative solutions that address environmental concerns while ensuring consistent performance. the chemical

already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also

some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and

commission will present the clean industrial deal. the cement sector is looking forward to a set of policy initiatives that will allow for a competitive transformation of the industry. cement and concrete are critical for a sustainable built environment of tomorrow, ranging from residential housing, business premises and factories to infrastructure and low carbon energy assets. along its manufacturing and downstream value chain, the cement industry is an indispensable contributor to making the european union achieve its climate targets. our path to decarbonization has been set in the cembureau net zero roadmap, recently updated in may 2024. the european cement industry ' s technology leadership has allowed to accelerate the deployment of new projects and processes along the cement and concrete value chain (see here our map of innovation projects). these projects, currently being deployed across the 200 cement plants across the european union and firmly embedded in local communities, will allow the cement industry to deliver low carbon products to market. the transformation of the cement industry, one of the four hard to abate sectors, requires significant upfront capital and operational costs. confronted with long investment cycles, our sector urgently needs the right set of enablers providing political and regulatory certainty for these investments to happen.

"" what is being simplified ? the omnibus package focuses on four key areas of sustainability regulation : 1. csrd (corporate sustainability reporting directive) requires large companies to report on environmental, social, and governance (esg) performance using standardized metrics (esrs). 2. csddd (corporate sustainability due diligence directive) mandates large firms to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights and environmental risks in their supply chains. 3. eu taxonomy regulation provides a classification system for sustainable economic activities, guiding companies and investors

changes introduced by the omnibus package 1. higher thresholds, fewer companies covered the threshold for csrd and eu taxonomy reporting has been raised from 250 to 1, employees, aligning with the

contribute to second consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth

ecosystem, has grown substantially from its origins in the early 1990s. despite this growth, voluntary markets have been hampered by reputational and functional concerns about offset quality and the space remains fragmented. with no long term regulatory obligations or pricing signals on carbon, firms are left to chart their net zero paths with little guidance or policy vision. the question is whether organized voluntary carbon markets can help resolve these challenges by creating credible incentives for emissions reductions. this brief reviews recent initiatives aimed at creating more functional, transparent, and effective carbon marketplaces. in many cases, there is a growing intersection between government and private sector activity in voluntary markets. these novel initiatives demonstrate how market design choices imply different goals for voluntary markets. these models suggest new ways for governments to support the legitimacy and success of voluntary markets. this brief considers how these market approaches could be best suited to support u. s. policy and trade strategies. note on terminology it is important to be clear on the terminology used in this brief. the phrase "" voluntary carbon market "" can be used in various ways. the first usage of the term refers to the global voluntary carbon market in its broadest conception. this is the noncentralized,

economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive

built on sectoral specificities. being unevenly exposed to certain risks undermining their competitiveness in europe and on international markets, industrial companies do not easily reach common ground. indeed, some sectors are more exposed to risks of retaliation from trade partners or circumvention of the cbam through resource shuffling. some also fear that the risks of carbon leakage will be shifted to the downstream segments of their value chain. compatibility with the world trade organization \' s rules is also a concern for some of them. the exposure to those risks therefore depends on sectoral specificities such as complexity of the value chain, vulnerability of the downstream segment, exposure to resource shuffling or to international competition. averse to uncertainty,

point by 2050, even though looking at the past and next decade it is quite clear that industry has been lagging behind, partly due to the built in counter incentives the ets has created for eu

submission to dg taxud ' s informal expert group on the analytical methods for the monitoring, reporting, quantification and verification of embedded emissions in goods under the scrope of the carbon

accounted for when measuring the carbon footprint of imported goods pursuant to article 7 (6) of the regulation on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). we believe that this poses a risk on the integrity of the cbam, by creating an incentive to circumvent the scheme through resource shuffling. this means that importers may escape cbam charges by choosing to only import to europe the goods with the lowest embedded emissions, while leaving the others out of europe, without changing production methods. resource shuffling could undermine the cbam the manufacturing of metal goods can sometimes be done by indistinctly using primary metallurgy (based on virgin ores) or metal scrap, with negligible difference in quality, as is the case for many aluminium products. if the embedded emissions of products from recycled aluminium are assumed to be zero, importers may have the possibility to escape cbam charges by choosing to only import products made from scrap. this is resource shuffling in action. this practice is not fraud and will be difficult for the commission to monitor and prevent. but its effect could be devastating on the cbam itself, as the distortion thus created between eu made goods (constrained under the eu ets) and imports (escaping cbam charges) would prevent eu producers from passing on their carbon costs to products sold, and lead to losses and ultimately, carbon leakage. no incentive to recycle assigning zero emission to metal scrap might be seen as a positive incentive for our trade partners to recycle more metals. however, this is not the case. metals are already one of the most universally recycled materials, with, for example, over 10 million tonnes of aluminium scrap consumed by china every year [ 2 ]. this compares to just 0. 17 million tonnes of aluminium products exported by china to the eu in 2019 [ 3 ]. so a carbon levy applying to primary metallurgy alone would fall very short of incentivising any increase in chinese

world photo : grispb via adobe stock available downloads introduction a variety of forces are promoting reindustrialization of the united states. concerned about the fragility of long supply chains, some firms are reinvesting in u. s. production. they are enabled by government support ranging from tax subsidies for capital investment to active support for strategic industries that will keep the united states at the technological frontier or that relate closely to national security. expanding manufacturing in the united states inevitably raises questions for energy policy. energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in europe and elsewhere. the role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. gas supplied 43 percent of u. s. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. as policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas. to probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of u. s. manufacturing from a carbon intensity perspective. this paper presents the key findings from csis ' s researchincluding from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviewsand policy recommendations on how the united states can maintain competitiveness while furthering decarbonization. reshoring manufacturing since 2020, investments in new manufacturing facilities have accelerated in the united states, driven by two key sectors : semiconductors and electric vehicles (evs). remarkably, real spending on construction of computer and electrical manufacturing facilities, including semiconductor and ev battery manufacturing, has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2022. by april 2024, project announcements reached $ 367. 9 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and $ 84. 4 billion for ev manufacturing. 1 these industries now account for

half day session training course, we will cover eudr compliance, deforestation risks, and supply chain traceability. through case studies and exercises, you will gain the tools to meet regulations, enhance transparency, and avoid risks. the eu deforestation regulation (eudr) is transforming global trade by ensuring that commodities like coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber are sourced without contributing to deforestation. businesses must now demonstrate compliance through traceability, due diligence, and risk assessments to maintain access to the eu market. eudr is not just a legal requirement. it marks a fundamental shift toward sustainable supply chains. companies that fail to comply face penalties, reputational risks, and potential market exclusion, while those that adapt early can gain a competitive edge and enhance their global credibility. achieving compliance requires robust data collection, supply chain transparency, and proactive engagement with suppliers. this workshop provides practical strategies, industry case studies, and best practices to help businesses navigate eudr requirements, mitigate risks, and implement effective sustainability measures. companies importing key commodities into the eu must establish robust traceability and due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the eu deforestation regulation (eudr). this is a crucial phase in preparing for full enforcement, where non compliance may lead to penalties and restricted market access. businesses will be required to provide geolocation data, risk assessments, and deforestation free verification for affected products such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber. early investment in supply chain transparency, digital tracking tools, and supplier engagement can offer a competitive advantage while minimizing future compliance risks. the shift toward deforestation free trade will impact pricing, sourcing strategies, and supply chain structures, making early preparation essential. we are in a critical transition phase where companies must act now to align with eudr. this training will provide best practices, case studies, and compliance strategies to help businesses navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and ensure full readiness. program overview day 1 : understand the european deforestation regulation (eudr) and its impact on industries, focusing

sharing of environmental and social sustainability efficacy, which supports the demands for transparency and confirmation of ethical practices within mining and steel manufacturing supply chains. the steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent blockchain network, stakeholders in the

supply chains, some firms are reinvesting in u. s. production. they are enabled by government support ranging from tax subsidies for capital investment to active support for strategic industries that will keep the united states at the technological frontier or that relate closely to national security. expanding manufacturing in the united states inevitably raises questions for energy policy. energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in europe and elsewhere. the role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. gas supplied 43 percent of u. s. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. as policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas. to probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of u. s. manufacturing from a carbon intensity perspective. this paper presents the key findings from csis ' s researchincluding from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviewsand policy recommendations on how the united states can maintain competitiveness while furthering decarbonization. reshoring manufacturing since 2020, investments in new manufacturing facilities have accelerated in the united states, driven by two key sectors :

to address this issue. founded by carlos monreal more than a decade ago, the company has been developing its unique tac process for plastic waste. our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company

creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and

to develop strong regional partnerships and optimize their distribution networks. customers are prioritizing sustainability, traceability, and esg (environmental, social, and governance) factors in their purchasing decisions, causing chemical companies to adapt their product portfolios and manufacturing processes to meet these demands. while challenging, this shift creates opportunities for

which involves third party verification and confirmation of calculations, which are then used as product industry averages numbers. another approach is self imposed producer sustainability reporting, which requires trust that reporting was done correctly. usually the trust question is also solved through third party verification, which can be very expensive for producers and is often only affordable for big corporations, which diminishes the concept of free competitiveness and makes sme uncompetitive. there are blockchain based solutions appearing at the market as digital alternatives for materials verification and products flow traceability. these can currently only solve the question of materials origin and supply chain traceability but the first startups are adding carbon footprint tracking along the entire value chain of products. the solution for fair carbon traceability and carbon border needs to include the possibility of tracing the eco footprint of each product per each producer, and not rely on a generic "" industry average "". even in countries where carbon regulation is not imposed, there are producers who are installing renewable energy sourcing, using fuels with low carbon footprint, etc. as an example : there could be two almost identical old steel plants in a country outside the eu, where plant a is investing in renewable energy generation, ccu, low emissions trucks, and plant b continues with old style production. if an eu carbon border mechanism uses an average generic number for the carbon footprint of steel from this country, this will completely disadvantage eco friendly investments. forcing such producers to hire third party verification can lead to unnecessary expenses and products price increase. the solution comes through a

in istanbul, gaziantep, izmir, and bursa, took place in adana, a city noted for its diverse industrial base. at the event that gathered leaders from companies based in ukurova region, a significant hub for turkey \' s exports, details were provided about the european green deal and the carbon border adjustment mechanism. hosted by garanti bbva general manager recep batu, prof. dr. etem karakaya from the eskiehir osmangazi university faculty of economics and administrative sciences, department of economics, shared insights on the economic aspects and solution proposals. additionally, dr. mahfi eilmez offered his assessments in the economic field. expressing his thoughts at the sustainable future in exports adana meeting, garanti bbva general manager recep batu stated, "" i want to emphasize that the climate crisis is intensifying every day as a critical issue. it is our collective responsibility to take action before the situation deteriorates further and to make the world a better place to live. in this context, the european green deal provides a significant roadmap. regarding the economic aspect, the carbon border adjustment mechanism is a crucial factor that will alter trade rules. the financial implications of this process will take effect on january 1,2026, when carbon credits will start being purchased. thus, we have limited time to adapt to this process. additionally, beyond the cbam, there will be various eu standards that will necessitate rapid changes in our production techniques. consequently, the importance of producing goods that are durable, recyclable, and have a low carbon footprint is increasing. unfortunately, exporters who do not comply with these specified criteria will fall behind in the competition. we need to be prepared now.

for those that move quickly to implement fundamental process changes and begin the transition to carbon neutrality. as regulatory, investor, and consumer pressures amplify the urgency for industrial decarbonization, the steel industry faces increasing demands for real plans to reduce emissions. that ' s not an easy task. to meet significant co2 reduction targets, the industry will have to make fundamental changes to its production processes. two possible solutions immediately come to mind : capturing the co2 produced by traditional steel plants and repurposing it or storing it underground, or closing existing plants and building new ones that operate initially on natural gas and eventually on green hydrogen. the industry has considered such changes for years, and a few companies are piloting production of low carbon, hydrogen based steel in small volumes. beyond that, however, little progress has been made, primarily because the two possible solutions are enormously expensive and would hike the price of steel by as much as 50 %. that may seem unpalatable in a commodity industry with extremely low margins to begin with. but the alternative will be increasingly costly as well. approved or anticipated global regulatory changes aimed at reaching carbon neutrality in the next 30 to 40 years will translate into ever mounting carbon costs for steel companies that continue to use traditional processes. europe is leading the way in regulatory reform, targeting a 55 % reduction in carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, primarily through so called market based measures, which require steel producers to pay for each metric ton of co2 emitted. in addition, the eu will soon introduce the innovative carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), essentially a tariff on steel imports based on the amount of carbon embedded in them. simultaneously, chinaby far the largest steel producing countryis seeking carbon neutrality by 2060 and is also in the process of introducing a national carbon pricing system. the first emissions trading started in 2021 in the power sector and is expected to expand to include the steel sector in the coming years. given the sheer size of chinese steel output, even a small percentage shift toward green steel production would bring large quantities to the market. this could alter trade balances significantly because a lot of this chinese steel would serve to meet the increasing demand for green products in europe. weighing all of the decarbonization trends roiling the steel industry, it is apparent that steel manufacturers

2027, the 27 member states of the european union (eu) will begin to charge third country based cement exporters for the co2 emissions of their products sold inside the bloc. the new carbon border

to make them change their ways. a regional solution leveraged through an unfair head start, however, might cause progress to falter where it is most needed in the global fight against climate change. carbon leakage has hung over the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) since its inception in 2005. cembureau, the european cement association, reported a 300 % five year increase in third country cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92m worth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free allocations were always expected to phase out in a mirror image of the cbam phase in. the proposal eventually adopted on 22 june 2022 set the end date for both as 2032. in 2020, the eu imported us $

of covered goods must now provide data on embedded emissions, paving the way for full financial implementation in 2026. at first, only 2. 5 % of imported emissions will have to be covered with the cbam certificates but the percentage will gradually increase and reach 100 % by 2034. starting january 2025, the following updates to cbam regulations will take effect : mandatory use of eu emission calculation methodology : importers will be required to calculate embedded emissions using the eu ' s standardized methodology, replacing the flexibility of prior methods. this ensures greater consistency and accuracy across reported data. enhanced cbam registry features : the cbam registry will introduce a feature allowing non eu installation operators to upload emissions data directly for importers, streamlining compliance and data verification processes. authorized cbam dec"", 'reference': '764', 'full_answer': 'however, disparities in carbon pricing across regions posed challenges,
