many changes were implemented during this commissions which will affect the outlook for eu climate policy and the eu ets. the forthcoming eu political elections bring an inevitable sense of uncertainty. questions regarding the role, architecture, and governance of the eu ets post 2030 are already being raised. some uneasiness resurfaces again with respect to impacts of regulatory interventions, as illustrated by the re power eu auction, which is seen as not transparent and unpredictable, pointing to governance concerns. this year \' s report identifies kpis to evaluate eu ets

2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the

on the notion that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment

investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream

turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knockon effects on technology industries that supply components to the automotive sector. conclusion orgalim ' s autumn 2024 economics & statistics report presents a sobering

insights, highlighting the need for transparent criteria in allocating such revenues and directing them towards climate action including industrial decarbonisation of the sectors covered under the eu ets and cbam, while simultaneously fostering international decarbonisation and lowcarbon industrial production. the european carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is the first instrument of its kind and is already set to become the testing ground for future border carbon adjustments (bcas) all over the world. accordingly, many discussions have been raised on the implementation of the cbam, including what would be the best way to allocate the revenues raised thanks to the mechanism. energy intensive industries within europe have called for these revenues to be clearly allocated domestically to accelerate the development of lowcarbon technologies and decarbonise energy intensive sectors. others again have called for cbam revenues, paid by european importers, to rather be allocated to help decarbonise industry outside of europe ' s borders with a particular focus on those countries most exposed to cbam. bellona europa has called for a combination approach, with part of the revenues allocated to domestic european efforts aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions and another part to be spent on international industrial decarbonisation. this is in line with furthering the stated aim of cbam in increasing international climate ambition. neither of these options was chosen by the european union (eu), which decided that 75 % of these revenues together with part of the revenues from the eu emission trading system (ets) will feed into the own resources of the european union in order to repay the expenses associated with borrowing under the next generation

the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 % simply cannot source their imported cbam goods from eu suppliers many handle shipments with hundreds of different skus most deal"", 'reference': '849', 'full_answer': 'as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders.', 'sentence_beginning': ' as eu manufacturers ', 'sentence_end': ' through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders.', 'similarity_score': 0.7611746191978455}, {'answer': '?

environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added

leakage not only undermines climate efforts but also results in the loss of revenues, jobs, and strategic autonomy for the eu. as part of its climate strategy, the eu plans to phase out free

disadvantage for european scrap recyclers and failing to incentivise the most climatefriendly solutions. this oversight could push 35 % of eu / eea recycling out of the market due to unfair

the ec will table a legislative proposal on 14 july 2021 for a cbam as part of the ' fit for 55 ' package of legislation designed to implement the eu ' s new greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 55 % below 1990 levels by 2030. * this will be followed by a codecision process between the european parliament and the council of the eu, which normally takes 12 years meaning a possible implementation of the mechanism is expected at the earliest in january 2023 the measure aims to reduce the risk of ' carbon leakage ' (ie a process whereby production moves outside of the eu to areas with weaker climate regulation), by requiring exporters to the eu to pay a carbon price at the eu border equivalent to that faced by eu producers under the eu emissions trading scheme (ets). the risk of carbon leakage has long been discussed in the eu and among academics, but until now the eu ' s response has been to allocate allowances under the eu ets to energyintensive industries for free. while there has"", 'reference': '1193', 'full_answer': ""these reactions have criticized the measure as ' green trade protectionism ', and for being inconsistent with the unfcc principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities ' (cbdr) however, least developed countries (ldcs) and other climate vulnerable countries including members of the climate vulnerable forum, v20, africa group and / or alliance of small island developing states (aosis) will also be both directly and indirectly impacted by the measure, and will be concerned about the potential implications it has for multilateral climate efforts."", 'sentence_beginning': "" these reactions have criticized the measure as ' green trade protectionism ', and for being inconsistent with the unfcc principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities ' (cbdr) however, least developed countries (ldcs) and other climate vulnerable countries including members of the climate vulnerable forum, v20, africa group and / or alliance of small island developing states (aosis) will also be both directly and indirectly impacted by the measure, and will be concerned about "", 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'its trading partners', 'confidence': np.float32(0.0029118976), 'start': np.int64(410), 'end': np.int64(411), 'context': 'a us version of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) was introduced in congress by senator whitehouse and colleagues to boost domestic manufacturers and address climate change. the clean competition act is legislation aimed at making domestic companies in the us more competitive in the global market. the bill is also for tackling the key sources of ghg emissions. the us cbam proposal aims to help reduce emissions across carbonintensive industries at home and abroad. the legislation is cosponsored by senators chris coons, brian schatz, and martin heinrich. why introduce us cbam bill ? a cbam is an environmental trade policy that sets fees on imports from highpolluting sectors. the clean competition act is a form of cbam that aims to promote decarbonization in the us. it \' s similar to the eu cbam in that they both will give the revenues to developing countries, for example. they also introduce charges for co2 emissions for imported goods coming into each country. but the us cbam is unique in that it levies a fee for emissions not only for importers but for domestic manufacturers, too. also, instead of an economywide fee, domestic companies will pay the carbon price only on emissions that go beyond the industry average. the bill \' s key author, sen. whitehouse, said that it \' s also to comply with the world trade organization protectionism rules. he stated that : "" this is an effort at carbon pricing, having there be a cost for polluting, but it \' s probably a considerably easier lift than a fullon carbon price.

for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while

striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across

made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the

by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those

under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation

acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought within the scope of the mechanism should be granted a sufficiently long transition period now and in the future."", 'reference': '1390', 'full_answer':

less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a

41am the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has

application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the euets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eubased manufactures will face an increase of at least 510 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eumade goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries, employment

automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease,

move production to countries outside the eu with less ambitious climate policies, leading to less economic activity in the eu and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the eu commission is considering implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as an alternative to the current free allocation of allowances or compensation for the increase in electricity costs. this mechanism proposes to counteract carbon leakage risk by putting a carbon price on imports of certain goods from outside the eu. ifiec supports the discussion initiated by the eu commission to incorporate an improved emission trading scheme. in this regard, the ifiec also generally welcomes all eu initiatives to improve carbon leakage protection for the european industry. the following aspects, however, should be taken into account. a cbam should only be introduced if the outstanding issues and concerns such as wto compatibility, carbon footprint assessment, certification and verification system, risk of protectionism escalation, export refunds, etc. listed below have been resolved. e a cbam should not replace already existing measures such as the eu ets free allowances and indirect cost compensation, since a cbam alone will not provide sufficient carbon leakage protection. o o it must be recognised that future free allocation of emission allowances will be further reduced, also due to new benchmarks values, so it will be a challenge to provide sufficient carbon leakage protection already from the year 2021 onwards. also, current carbon leakage protection measures should be supplemented with additional measures ensuring adequate protection for imports and exports. the cbam as proposed by the commission is solely focussing on import and does not take into account exporting sectors. due to the unforeseeable consequences of a system change, the free allocation of allowances and compensation of indirect coz costs within the electricity price should be maintained at least for a transitional period for import. for exports, it should be maintained until a structural solution is proposed. ifiec europe international federation of industrial energy

ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the

trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect

negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there

tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually

the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade

has made significant strides in the fight against climate change in recent years. by ratifying the paris agreement in 2021, it announced a target of achieving netzero emissions by 2053. the nationally determined contribution (ndc) has been updated, renewable energy investments have increased, and the green deal action plan has been implemented. however, challenges such as dependence on fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and deforestation persist. with steps like carbon pricing mechanisms and incentives for sustainable production, turkey aims to accelerate its transition to a lowcarbon economy. what is the european green deal (eu green deal) ? climate change is a global threat, and countries are starting to implement their action plans by setting climate goals. in this regard,

subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism

metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the euets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eubased manufactures will face an increase of at least 510 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eumade goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted

(cbam) puts forward a policy measure to prevent carbon leakage from domestic energyintensive and tradeexposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phaseout, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energyintensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs of the covered sectors in europe and internationally. by addressing the risk of carbon leakage, the cbam aims to safeguard the reduction of global emissions within its scope. though the ultimate objective of the cbam is to cover a wide range of products, the current proposal covers a limited number of sectors deemed to be at high risk of carbon leakage and for which the introduction of the measure is administratively and technically feasible. the selected sectors are iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, and electricity, with extended coverage of 56 categories of goods down the value chain. to unpack the multiple layers of the cbam proposal and allow for an analysis of their implications, it is necessary to identify the multiple and often intertwined elements of its scope and affected stakeholders. the existing literature points to at least the following elements (marcu et al., 2020,2021) : policy mechanism or design,

of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %.

failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with

mechanism (cbam) on july 14, as part of the "" fit for 55 "" package aiming to decrease by 55 % european greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. this tool is designed to avoid the risk of carbon leakage that arises as the differential in carbon costs increases between europe and third countries. while the european industry fully supports this decarbonization objective, it needs accompanying measures to preserve its competitiveness and investment capacities. the cbam seeks to achieve these goals. yet, in a recent research (french version here), we pointed out that the fine tuning of the mechanism, still under discussion, is so complex that industrial stakeholders do not all fully support the measure. relying on the 2020 public consultation launched by the european commission and interviews with around 50 representatives of manufacturing organizations and companies, we found out that preferences of european industry regarding the fine tuning of the mechanism are built on sectoral specificities. being unevenly exposed to certain risks undermining their competitiveness in europe and on international markets, industrial companies do not easily reach common ground. indeed, some sectors are more exposed to risks of retaliation from trade partners or circumvention of the cbam through resource shuffling. some also fear that the risks of carbon leakage will be shifted to the downstream segments of their value chain. compatibility with the world trade organization \' s rules is also a concern for some of them. the exposure to those risks therefore depends on sectoral specificities such as complexity of the value chain, vulnerability of the downstream segment, exposure to resource shuffling or to international competition. averse to uncertainty, industrial stakeholders turn to older measures that preserved their competitiveness during the first phases of the emissions trading system (eu ets), namely free allowances and indirect carbon cost compensation. indeed, they need visibility and stability in order to plan their investments, as most decarbonization assets have long lifespan, from 15 to 50 years and over (blanchard and tirole ,', 'reference':

border adjustment mechanism (cbam) would contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality by 2050. it would operate alongside the other policy tools in the \' fit for 55 \' package by addressing the risks of socalled carbon leakage resulting from the eu \' s increased climate ambition. carbon leakage is the hypothetical situation whereby european producers competing in international markets would shift their production and pollution to countries with less stringent or no climate policies to lower their compliance costs. cbam will progressively become an alternative to current carbon leakage protection measures, notably free allocation of emission allowances under the eu emissions trading system (ets). it ensures an equivalent carbon price for domestic and imported production on selected goods. this way, it would also encourage trading partners to reduce their emissions. how will it work in practice ? companies that want to import goods produced outside the eu into the eu will have to purchase certificates corresponding to the amount of emissions generated in the production of those goods. the european commission will calculate the price of cbam certificates to reflect the average weekly price of ets auctions. this means that cbam certificates will be pegged to the ets. this will ensure that the price of cbam certificates is as close as possible to the price of ets allowances while also ensuring that the system remains manageable for the administrative authorities. ~ @ > howdo cbam certificates work ? companies importing goods into the eu will have to purchase cbam certificates and then surrender the required amount to cover the corresponding emissions each year. there are no limits on the number of cbam certificates an importer may purchase so as to avoid imposing restrictions on trade. unlike ets allowances, cbam certificates are not tradeable nor bankable to ensure they constantly reflect the evolution of the ets price, as any divergence could create disparities in price so wide that they could weaken the incentives for decarbonisation between domestic and imported goods. certificates are valid for two years from the date of purchase. repurchasing

risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the euets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu', 'reference': '155', 'full_answer': 'as it

"" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric', 'reference': '920', 'full_answer': 'the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints.', 'sentence_beginning': ' the latter

border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains how the cbam works and the impact on climate policies it is already

the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissionsintensive

challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a

global partners and supporting them in implementing climate policy. in this way, a cbam could be a transitional tool towards equivalent domestic carbon pricing systems. a cbam must however be carefully designed and particular attention should be paid to minimizing the risk of global trade disruptions. therefore, first, the most straightforward way would be for importers to be required to surrender eu emission allowances for goods which they import to the eu. this would ensure full compatibility with carbon pricing in the eu and the existing energy and climate policy framework as well as maximum transparency and act as a basis for future ets cooperation. second, any mechanism should first focus on specific pilot sectors, to test the effectiveness of different policy configurations, and ensure the possibility to pivot towards other solutions leading to better results. third and importantly, we agree with the european commission that the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism for a sector has to be linked to a gradual phaseout of free allocation. finally, a mechanism designed to prevent carbon leakage should take into account global climate policy developments. the desirable longterm outcome is one in which such mechanisms are no longer needed. the global policy landscape is gradually moving closer towards the vision of global carbon pricing. this offers significant potential for cooperation between trading schemes, which should be the priority for stakeholders around the world. eex strongly supports the european green deal eex welcomes the green deal initiative and increase of the 2030 ambition as a pivotal step for europe to achieve its climate targets and assert its role as global climate action leader. energy markets, and in particular power

the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought within the scope of the mechanism should be granted a sufficiently long transition period now and"", 'reference':

came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the

societies and businesses face increasing uncertainty due to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, instability in global energy and commodity markets, and unclear climate commitments by key

transition to climate neutrality, if high ambition levels are maintained and if controversial files such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) are addressed with sensitive and sensible climate diplomacy. one of the european commission ' s stated intentions of the cbam is to drive higher climate ambition internationally. in order to deliver effectively, this instrument will have to support the reduction of eu greenhouse gas emissions while also creating incentives for higher climate ambition from international trading partners. it must also act as an alternative to the eu emissions trading system (ets) carbon leakage protection measures such as free allowances and indirect cost compensation. as the world ' s first internationally applicable border mechanism seeking to put a price on a negative environmental impact, the cbam will only achieve its aim of higher international climate ambition if it is designed to provide real incentives for industries within and

the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 100 allowances must be surrendered for 100 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer

recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knockon

announce the launch of the hydrogen for europe study, nearly two years after its inception ! the eu \' s ambition to reach climate neutrality by 2050 has recently pushed hydrogen at the top of the european energy policy agenda as the limits of electrification became clear alongside the need to find a solution for the decarbonization of hardtoabate sectors. as europe prepares to roll out legislation aimed at accelerating the production of hydrogen, hydrogen for europe charts two potential pathways "" technology diversity "" and "" renewable push "" with an indepth look at their implications, based on actual european targets and transparent modelling frameworks. the research project looks at the technology mix, cost of the transition, and risks associated with different policy choices. it finds that the contribution of hydrogen to decarbonizing the eu \' s energy system can well exceed eu projections, with demand potentially exceeding 100 million tonnes of h2 by 2050. it also stressed the essential role played by lowcarbon hydrogen (which can be produced from natural gas in combination with ccs, or methane pyrolysis) can play in supporting the deployment of renewable hydrogen and the integration of higher volumes of renewable energy overall. in both scenarios, renewable hydrogen production scales up rapidly after 2030. however, a more diverse technology mix enables a lowercost (1 trillion less from now until 2050) and a more effective pathway to eu climate neutrality by 2050. the study was conducted by research partners ifp energies nouvelles

"" there is no point in only reducing greenhouse gas emissions at home if we increase the import of co2 from abroad. it is not only a climate issue ; it is also an issue of fairness, "" she told the davos world economic forum in january. the proposal for a carbon border tax is part of the eu \' s larger goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and was identified in december \' s european green deal as a way to catalyse this transition, alongside reforms to the taxation of energy products. carbon emissions are already priced within the eu through the eu emissions trading system (ets), which is levied on highemitting industries at around 25 per tonne. since foreign companies do not have to pay it, their products may enjoy a competitive advantage, which increases the risk of socalled carbon leakage, where the manufacture of products such as electricity, steel and cement are outsourced to other countries with less ambitious emissions reduction policies. carbon leakage occurs when companies move their production from one place, usually a country with emissions reduction policies, to another with laxer policies. this is done to avoid the costs associated with the stricter policies. the greenhouse gas emissions (carbon) that the company produces are simply emitted in another country (leakage), thereby failing to reduce emissions overall. such leakage is seen as a threat to jobs and investment in eu countries, and undermines climate policies. a carbon border tax would make imports pay the same carbon price as domestic products to reflect their impact on the climate. it would also incentivise other countries to forge stronger climate policies because those levying their own carbon price domestically would be exempt. the idea has gained momentum as part of the solution to the economic crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic. the european commission \' s recovery plan suggested it as an option to contribute to financing the future eu budget. depending on the

launch of the european union ' s emissions trading system (eu ets), energyintensive tradeexposed basic material products such as steel have enjoyed the free allocation of eu ets allowances. however, these conditions are gradually changing due to the linear reduction of the allowance cap caused by the bloc ' s recently upgraded climate ambition. facing the increasingly higher eu carbon price, eu companies might simply shift production and emissions offshore, causing carbon leakage. against such a backdrop, the eu cbam legislation process has departed, after the european parliament adopted the cbam resolution on 10 march 2021. the eu intends to implement the cbam as early as 2023 with at least three years of a transition period. as per the recently leaked draft of the legislative proposal, the eu cbam would only cover limited industrial sectors by imposing carbon prices on the imports of iron and steel, cement and clinker, fertilizer, aluminum, and electricity at the eu border. the policy ' s direct impact would vary from country to country. for example, the cbamtargeted products altogether account for about three percent of the export volume of the eu ' s largest trading

importers could face annual tariffs of some 1 billion euros when cbam regulations are fully enforced in 2034. while the levies will initially apply only to a relatively small number of the most
