that domestic decarbonization policies could result in lost competitive advantage visavis nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s

policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives

to work alongside the eu ets. by placing a carbon price on imports of certain goods, cbam effectively extends the reach of the eu ets ' s pricing mechanism beyond the eu ' s borders. the progress and impact of cbam will be watched keenly because of its potential to reshape global trade and climate policy. one of the least acknowledged but most significant challenges of the global sustainability agenda has been to ensure widespread adoption of carbon accounting. managing and reducing carbon emissions across the globe is only possible when the companies accurately calculate and disclose their emissions. the cbam design necessitates that importers of notified goods into europe file the embedded carbon in their products. currently, more than 90 % of the world ' s polluters do not calculate and report emissions. this could soon change. cbam is touted as a tool to encourage countries outside the eu to strengthen their climate policies and stimulate global innovation efforts in low carbon

then we could see more such regulations and climaterelated policies over the next few years. not only will the paperwork increase manifold but also budgets for trade experts including lawyers.

starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the

paris agreement will require disruptive system innovations in all sectors of the global economy. to make the required transition a success, we will need strong governance frameworks that combine longterm strategic planning complemented with compatible short and midterm policy development. this will allow countries to achieve their climate neutrality objectives in a smart and costeffective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climateneutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver emissions reductions remains in line with keeping temperature increases in line with the goals of the paris agreement. with the launch of the european green deal and the eu ' s 2050 climate neutrality target, the eu is revising the main corpus of its climate regulations. the new intermediary 2030 target of at least 55 % means that eu and national targets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and emission reductions need to be ramped up and achieve transformative change during the next decade. while the targets and regulations may be set at eu level, a lot of the heavy lifting of the european green deal will have to be done at nationally. behind the 2030 and 2050 targets are very diverse member states facing different challenges to decarbonise and provide a just transition for their citizens. our work on national climate policies focuses on the need for strategic national investment plans for climate action. these plans should prioritise costeffective, longterm solutions and avoid stranded assets or lockin effects. our research contributes to strengthening climate policy governance across europe and ensuring emissions cuts are costeffective and permanent. at the same time, we study the interactions between eu

reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. however, disparities in carbon pricing across regions posed challenges, including carbon leakagewhere companies relocate production to jurisdictions with less stringent climate policies. the european union spearheaded cbam ' s development as a solution to these challenges. initially proposed as part of the european green deal, cbam targeted key carbonintensive sectors like steel, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, hydrogen, and electricity. by attaching a carbon price equal to european emission allowances to imports from non eu countries, the mechanism sought to equalize the cost of carbon emissions between domestic producers and foreign competitors. cbam today current implementation status the eu began cbam ' s implementation in october 2023 with a transitional phase focused on reporting obligations. importers of covered goods must now provide data on embedded emissions, paving the way for full financial implementation in 2026. at first, only 2. 5 % of imported emissions will have to be covered with the cbam certificates but the percentage will gradually increase and reach 100 % by 2034. starting january 2025, the following updates to cbam regulations will take effect : mandatory use of eu emission calculation methodology : importers will be required to calculate embedded emissions using the eu ' s standardized methodology, replacing the flexibility of prior methods. this ensures greater consistency and accuracy across reported data. enhanced cbam registry features : the cbam registry will introduce a feature allowing non eu installation operators to upload emissions data directly for importers, streamlining compliance and data verification processes. authorized"", 'reference': '742',

become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (euets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the euets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the', 'reference': '155', 'full_answer':

cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets

while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed

between countries with different climate policies, namely by ensuring equivalent carbon pricing for imports and domestic products. by confirming that a price has been paid for the embedded carbon

robust, efficient and fair business tax framework that supports the post covid19 recovery, removes obstacles to crossborder investment in the single market and creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a longterm vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in

hung over the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) since its inception in 2005. cembureau, the european cement association, reported a 300 % fiveyear increase in thirdcountry cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92mworth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free

administration. president biden, the greenest president in u. s. history, says he supports a cbam for the united states, which would help the united states align itself with the eu and advance climate action. but president biden has not made the issue a priority, and the issue could complicate international climate talks ahead of cop26. without a counter move from the united states, the eu \' s tax on u. s. goods could raise costs for certain u. s. industries and workers. in response to the eu, the biden administration and cbam supporters in congress are taking a measured and deliberate approach to cbams for the time being, with democrats proposing a tariff on carbonintensive imports to go in the infrastructure bill. this section looks at the affected sectors of an eu cbam, the current us

economic activities such as electricity generation or carbon intensive industry carried out within the bloc ' s borders. the new carbon border adjustment mechanism, or cbam, extends the reach of the eu ets to cover imports of certain products entering the european economic area. the cbam replaces free allocation as the primary tool to protect tradeexposed sectors against carbon leakage. according to the provisional agreement reached by the council and the european parliament, the initial 3year pilot phase of cbam requires eu importers to report the greenhouse gases released during production (direct and indirect) of aluminium, cement, iron and steel, fertilizer, hydrogen, as well as electricity produced outside of the eu. the provisional agreement was preceded by long discussions on the scope and coverage of the mechanism. the goal is to extend the coverage of the mechanism to also include further commodities subject to carbon leakage, such as organic chemicals and polymers (plastics), as well as eventually all goods covered by the eu ets. once the cbam enters into force in 2027, importers will need to acquire and surrender certificates corresponding to the greenhouse gases associated with imports from outside of the eu. the cbam was introduced to promote a level playing field in terms of the regulatory burden of climate policies between producers of similar products within the eu and outside of it. in many cases its introduction will reduce the competitiveness of carbon intensive products manufactured outside of the region. many of the immediate considerations of the cbam ' s potential impact centre around countries who are key exporters of the affected products to the eu and therefore immediately and directly implicated. in this blog, we

the eu, or intend to in the future, now have an extra incentive to consider the climate footprint of their activities. and the policy has the potential to impact trade flows beyond just those

important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the endtoend production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent blockchain network, stakeholders in the steel recycling process can be connected and have realtime visibility into the entire supply chain.', 'reference': '794', 'full_answer': 'the steel industry can improve

lynchpin in the strategy to reduce eu industries ' co2 emissions by 55 % between 1990 and 2030. starving foreign cement industries of a source of income may also help to make them change their ways. a regional solution leveraged through an unfair head start, however, might cause progress to falter where it is most needed in the global fight against climate change. carbon leakage has hung over the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) since its inception in 2005. cembureau, the european cement association, reported a 300 % fiveyear increase in thirdcountry cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92mworth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free allocations were always expected to phase out in a mirror image of the cbam phasein. the proposal eventually adopted on 22 june 2022 set the end date for both as 2032. in 2020, the eu imported us $ 383mworth of cement and concrete

gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver emissions reductions remains in line with keeping temperature increases in line with the goals of the paris agreement. with the launch of the european green deal and the eu ' s 2050 climate neutrality target, the eu is revising the main corpus of its climate regulations. the new intermediary 2030 target of at least 55 % means that eu and national targets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and emission reductions need to be ramped up and achieve transformative change during the next decade. while the targets and regulations may be set at eu level, a lot of the heavy lifting of the european green deal will have to be done at nationally. behind the 2030 and 2050 targets are very diverse member states facing different challenges to decarbonise and provide a just transition for their citizens. our work on national climate policies focuses on the need for strategic national investment plans for climate action. these plans should prioritise costeffective, longterm solutions and avoid stranded assets or lockin effects. our research contributes to strengthening climate policy governance across europe and ensuring emissions cuts are costeffective and permanent. at the same time, we study the

make the required transition a success, we will need strong governance frameworks that combine longterm strategic planning complemented with compatible short and midterm policy development. this will allow countries to achieve their climate neutrality objectives in a smart and costeffective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climateneutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver emissions reductions remains in line with keeping temperature increases in line with the goals of the paris agreement. with the launch of the european green deal and the eu ' s 2050 climate neutrality target, the eu is revising the main corpus of its climate regulations. the new intermediary 2030 target of at least 55 % means that eu and national targets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and emission reductions need to be ramped up and achieve transformative change during the next decade. while the targets and regulations may be set at

overcapacity global steel overcapacity has exceeded 550 million tons, with 150 million tons of additional capacity projected by next year. this represents more than four times the eu \' s steel production. recent us tariffs are further increasing the pressure to redirect trade flows. it is therefore critical to align the eu \' s safeguards under the current review with today \' s market reality and to develop an effective and comprehensive trade regime for the postsafeguards period. in parallel, the trade defense instruments need to be implemented in a full, effective and ambitious manner. the "" external dimension "" of the clean industrial deal focused more on horizontal issues such as access to raw materials and developing international partnerships. eurofer expects that sectorspecific measures on trade will be an essential part of the steel and metals action plan. 2) gaps in cbam must be closed the border carbon adjustment mechanism (cbam) should offset the carbon cost of steel produced within the european union, while ensuring that steel from third countries is taxed equally. however, the current mechanism fails to provide effective protection due to a number of loopholes. stricter controls must be introduced to fully implement cbam, otherwise european producers will continue to lose competitiveness. mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that third country producers actually pay their carbon costs. in particular, countries such as china and india can offer cheaper steel to the european market by producing at lower carbon costs. special incentives should be provided to increase the competitiveness of eu steel exporters in the global market. if steel produced in europe fails to remain competitive on', 'reference': '481',

metal energy intensive sectors such as copper, zinc, nickel, ferroalloys and silicon may be added at a later stage. executive summary of eurometaux position on cbam 1 given that our industry is the most electrointensive of the sectors and a pricetaker with globally set pricing mechanisms, we are highly exposed to carbon leakage due to indirect carbon costs. however, having analysed the proposal, we cannot see how a cbam can address indirect carbon costs (which are different to indirect emissions). v we thus support the decision of the european commission to exclude scope 2 emissions for now. we believe that scope 2 emissions should be excluded and that the recently agreed indirect costs compensation system \' should remain in place until at least 2030. elsewhere, we also hold the position that : a solution needs to be found for exports ; stronger prevention measures and a more comprehensive definition is needed to prevent circumvention ; adjustments need to be made to the thirdparty exemption and verification rules ; a broader products scope for the sectors in a cbam is needed ; downstream impacts should be more closely analysed ; greater predictability and transparency is needed

(cbam) proposal position paper of the european non ferrous metals sector this paper provides the initial reaction of eurometaux to the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) proposal. eurometaux represents european nonferrous metals producers. amongst nonferrous, the aluminium sector is included in the list of cbam sectors for phase 1. other nonferrous metal energy intensive sectors such as copper, zinc, nickel, ferroalloys and silicon may be added at a later stage. executive summary of eurometaux position on cbam 1 given that our industry is the most electrointensive of the sectors and a pricetaker with globally set pricing mechanisms, we are highly exposed to carbon leakage due to indirect carbon costs. however, having analysed the proposal, we cannot see how a cbam can address indirect carbon costs (which are different to indirect emissions). v we thus support the decision of the european commission to exclude scope 2 emissions for now. we believe that scope 2 emissions should be excluded and that the recently agreed indirect costs compensation system \' should remain in place until at least 2030. elsewhere, we also hold the position that : a solution needs to be found for exports ; stronger prevention measures and a more comprehensive definition is needed to prevent circumvention ; adjustments need to be made to the thirdparty exemption and verification rules ; a broader products scope for the sectors in a cbam is needed ; downstream impacts should be more closely analysed ; greater predictability and transparency is needed with regards secondary legislation ; the phasing in and phasing out with existing ets needs to be closely analysed ; and a review mechanism should be included. \' guidelines on certain state aid measures in the context of

the first reporting period for importers ending 31 january 2024. cbam is designed to work alongside the eu ets. by placing a carbon price on imports of certain goods, cbam effectively extends the reach of the eu ets ' s pricing mechanism beyond the eu ' s borders. the progress and impact of cbam will be watched keenly because of its potential to reshape global trade and climate policy. one of the least acknowledged but most significant challenges of the global sustainability agenda has been to ensure widespread adoption of carbon accounting. managing and reducing carbon emissions across the globe is only possible when the companies accurately calculate and disclose their emissions. the cbam design necessitates that importers of notified goods into europe file the embedded carbon in their products. currently, more than 90 % of the world ' s polluters do not calculate and report emissions. this could soon change. cbam is touted as a tool to encourage countries outside the eu to strengthen their climate policies and stimulate global innovation efforts in low carbon technologies. however, it will also test the path of least resistance for international trade laws and relations. if the legislation is successful in navigating complex and diplomatic trade waters then we could see more such regulations and climaterelated policies over the next few years. not only will the paperwork increase manifold but also budgets for trade experts including lawyers. however, the most transformative impact of the cbam will be on the carbon markets. through the trading of credits, cbam will unlock the potential of carbon as an asset class. currently, the price signals given by the eu ets for the trading of carbon have limited impact at the global level but with cbam working

their ways. a regional solution leveraged through an unfair head start, however, might cause progress to falter where it is most needed in the global fight against climate change. carbon leakage has hung over the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) since its inception in 2005. cembureau, the european cement association, reported a 300 % fiveyear increase in thirdcountry cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92mworth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free

10. 24. 24 multiple authors 24. 10. 2024 | 10 : 41am the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains

to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissionsintensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissionsintensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a

decarbonisation took centre stage among policymakers around the globe. from the emergence of carbon border fees and carbon disclosure requirements to significant climaterelated spending and incentive packages, new policies have begun infusing carbon into what it means to do international business. in the indian context, the european commission \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in 2023 has received significant attention because of how it may impact indian exports into the european union (eu). the european commission adopted the cbam, in 2023, as part of its wider climate and trade policy to address carbon leakage. more specifically, the cbam requires product emissions reporting for various imported commodities from various carbonintensive, hardtoabate industriesincluding iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen. for any imported good from one of these industries that exceeds a specified carbon intensity level, importers will face a carbon pollution fee based on national averages unless they can demonstrate they took voluntary actions to reduce their emissions, such as by procuring clean energy. the european commission adopted the cbam, in 2023, as part of its wider climate and trade policy to address carbon leakage. the introduction of cbam has spurred diverse reactions, with proponents advocating its role in preventing carbon

reducing carbon emissions. conversely, sceptics and opponents view cbam as a punitive measure, masking trade protectionism under the guise of environmental concerns. this scepticism is rooted in the perception that cbam, similar to the intention behind the eu emissions trading system, prioritises economic interests over environmental goals. cbam, in this light, is seen as the latest manifestation of colonialism and domestic protectionism, albeit repackaged with new rhetoric centred around economic security and decarbonisation. in the case of india, the implications of the cbam extend beyond mere reductions in exports to the eu and the associated economic consequences, also raising concerns regarding equity, efficiency, and its compatibility with principles like common but differentiated

some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than

this is made possible by annex f. 2, which stipulates that preconsumer scrap should be assigned "" zero emissions "". this would effectively allow installation to cheat the system and export

differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric', 'reference': '920', 'full_answer': 'as countries decarbonize

to maintain its leadership role in global action against climate change. however, if measures are unilateral, europe risks having a limited impact on global reductions in ghg emission, while damaging

supporting the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation. the objective of this mechanism is to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports while ensuring that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less stringent policies. nitrogen fertilizer producers are among sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage due to the industry ' s emission intensity and exposure to international trade. the european fertilizer industry therefore welcomed the european commission ' s initiative to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism., but, since the beginning, underlined that for the fertilizer sector cbam would only work if eu ets free allocations at full benchmark level were maintained at least till 2030 and if cbam would also foresee a solution for the export part of the production. a welldesigned cbam could be particularly important for the sector since already today the main european fertilizer products have a climate footprint that is typically half of the global average. an effective and welldesigned cbam should aim at avoiding the replacement of ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers produced in europe with imports from countries with a worse carbon footprint while at the same time allowing the transformation of the industry toward a zerocarbon production. fertilizers europe is therefore advocating for the cbam designed as a reinforcement of current carbon leakage measures with the steppedup climate ambition. why do we need an equal treatment between the ets and cbam sectors achieving a higher

to forestall carbon leakage, whereby european production relocates outside europe, and is intended to encourage other countries to follow europe \' s lead and raise cli mate ambition. how this cbam would work is as yet unclear, although there is a clear wish for the measure to be compatible with world trade organisation (wto) rules. the purpose of cbam is not to help, nor protect, european industry beyond preventing carbon leakage. in this policy brief, the authors make seven clear and pragmatic recommendations on the implementation of this measure if europe decides to go ahead with it. misunderstandings are already arising, partly as a result of the declared use of revenues raised. as so often in policymaking, there are tradeoffs to be made, and one of the primary recommendations is to en gage early with international partners and explore the possibility of acting in unison with others who share the goal of raising climate ambition and are also concerned about potential carbon leakage. a gradual start for the cbam is also recommended in order to capture the benefits of learningbydoing. policy brief authors and policy dialogue conveners : jos delbeke (eib professor of

tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade

(european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluterspayprinciple ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the capandtrade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that lesspolluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbonintensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 %

climate target seems likely to significantly increase the carbon price in the eu ets, which will increase the relevance of all mechanisms addressing the risk of carbon leakage. the commission has already expressed that it will consider introducing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) in 2023 to address carbon leakage and to generate new revenues for the next generation eu (ngeu)

risks related to the cbam far exceed the expected benefits and, hence, the cbam should not be introduced. the objective of the cbam is to replace the existing systems to address the issue : free

to its current policy tools and continue minimising the risk of carbon leakage in its climate diplomacy. cbam is always a secondbest option in climate policy even more so if it is unilateral.

coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto)

"" there is no point in only reducing greenhouse gas emissions at home if we increase the import of co2 from abroad. it is not only a climate issue ; it is also an issue of fairness, "" she told the davos world economic forum in january. the proposal for a carbon border tax is part of the eu \' s larger goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and was identified in december \' s european green deal as a way to catalyse this transition, alongside reforms to the taxation of energy products. carbon emissions are already priced within the eu through the eu emissions trading system (ets), which is levied on highemitting industries at around 25 per tonne. since foreign companies do not have to pay it, their products may enjoy a competitive advantage, which increases the risk of socalled carbon leakage, where the manufacture of products such as electricity, steel and cement are outsourced to other countries with less ambitious emissions reduction policies. carbon leakage occurs when companies move their production from one place, usually a country with emissions reduction policies, to another with laxer policies. this is done to avoid the costs associated with the stricter policies. the greenhouse gas emissions (carbon) that the company produces are simply emitted in another country (leakage), thereby failing to reduce emissions overall. such leakage is seen as a threat to jobs and investment in eu countries, and undermines climate policies. a carbon border tax would make imports pay the same carbon price as domestic products to reflect their impact on the climate. it would also incentivise other countries to forge stronger climate policies because those levying their own carbon price domestically would be exempt. the idea has gained momentum as part of the solution to the economic crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic. the european commission \' s recovery plan suggested it as an option to contribute to financing the future eu budget. depending on the scope and design, a carbon border "" adjustment mechanism "" could bring additional revenues of between 5 and 14 billion euros, it said. on 23 july, the commission launched a consultation on plans for a', 'reference': '93', 'full_answer': ""but this may change after european commission chief ursula von der leyen made a point of supporting the idea in her bid for the bloc ' s presidency and is now championing it as a central plank of climate policy."", 'sentence_beginning': ' but this may change ', 'sentence_end': "" made a point of supporting the idea in her bid for the bloc ' s presidency and is now championing it as a central plank of climate policy."", 'similarity_score': 0.7701241970062256}, {'answer': 'this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions', 'confidence': np.float32(0.0011927255), 'start': np.int64(155), 'end': np.int64(190), 'context': 'the european commission adopted on 18 may a communication on business taxation for the 21st century to promote a robust, efficient and fair business tax system in the european union. advertisement why has the european commission adopted a communication on business taxation for the 21st century ?

it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ?

most extreme cases where other options for finding a common solution have been exhausted. the primary tools against a risk of carbon leakage are current measures in eu emissions trading scheme (eu ets), like free allocation and indirect compensation, and they should be in place also in future. a carbon border adjustment mechanism is a new, complex and risky tool finnish businesses support the climate neutrality target of 2050 for the eu, and we see, that the eu ets is an effective tool to reduce ghg emissions in energy production and industry and must remain as a main instrument to these sectors. carbon pricing continues to gain traction globally as a costefficient tool for emissions reductions. there is continued progress on carbon pricing initiatives at the subnational, regional and national levels all around the world. currently around 20 % of global emissions are under a carbon price mechanism. but when comparing the measures among industry in different countries, progress is very slow among europe ' s main trading partners. the eu must ensure the global competitiveness of european companies and a level playing field in key export markets. it is good, that eu commission studies different options to minimize a risk of carbon leakage, which is due to uneven level of climate ambitious in europe and globally. in the same time ,"", 'reference': '534', 'full_answer': ""but

(see exhibit 1.) bcg \' s global trade model methodology the 2023 bcg global trade model projects global trade in goods from 2023 to 2032. it was developed by a team of bcg experts across functional disciplines such as global trade, financial institutions, and data analytics. the model uses historical correlations and artificial intelligence (al) to create 10year forecasts, using 500 million data points that measure macroeconomic indicators such as gdp, population, unemployment, public and private consumption, exchange, inflation and bank interest rates, and gdp deflator. the inputs are from reputable sources such as governments, international financial institutions, and economic analysis specialty firms. the model covers 150 + exporter countries in 14 key regions and more than 5, physical products or commodities in 22 industrial sectors. trade values are expressed in real terms, based on floating foreign exchange rates. a deflator is used to reduce the impact of inflation on export values. this year \' s trade model includes a number of improvements : trade values are indexed to 2010 to reduce yeartoyear volatility, in line with best practices of intergovernmental organizations. al and machine learning are', 'reference': '1298', 'full_answer': 'a deflator is used to reduce the impact of inflation on export values.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': ' is used to reduce the impact of inflation on export values.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}]",inflation pressures
