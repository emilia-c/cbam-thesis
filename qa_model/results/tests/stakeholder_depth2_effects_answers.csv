nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s preexisting approach to decarbonizing the industrial sector. another approach, which may be more appropriate for the current state of global climate policy, is to design an industrial decarbonization policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level

brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam

can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a', 'reference': '920', 'full_answer': 'introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and

collaboration (crdc). in this second interview, we will be speaking with carlos monreal, founder and ceo of plastic energy. join us as we delve deeper into the efforts of plastic energy to tackle the issue of plastic waste and create value from it. plastic waste is a global problem that has farreaching environmental impacts, and plastic energy is a company that aims to address this issue. founded by carlos monreal more than a decade ago, the company has been developing its unique tac process for plastic waste. our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and wellknown brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closedloop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in foodgrade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company has projects in europe,

european commission adopted on 18 may a communication on business taxation for the 21st century to promote a robust, efficient and fair business tax system in the european union. advertisement why has the european commission adopted a communication on business taxation for the 21st century ? the eu needs a robust, efficient and fair business tax framework that supports the post covid19 recovery, removes obstacles to crossborder investment in the single market and creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a longterm vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in the longterm, today \' s communication presents a plan for a new framework for business taxation in the eu, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax obstacles and foster a more businessfriendly environment in the single market. the "" business in europe : framework for income

way is to ensure globally competitive production costs, starting with access to energy. eurometaux has long been calling for the european commission and the member states to create the right

international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more

economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in the longterm, today \' s communication presents a plan for a new framework for business taxation in the eu, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax obstacles and foster a more businessfriendly environment in the single market. the "" business in europe : framework for income taxation "" (or', 'reference': '309', 'full_answer': 'this

importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their

heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global

occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help

triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream products are more competitive

areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions

objectives in a smart and costeffective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climateneutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu '

years after its inception ! the eu \' s ambition to reach climate neutrality by 2050 has recently pushed hydrogen at the top of the european energy policy agenda as the limits of electrification became clear alongside the need to find a solution for the decarbonization of hardtoabate sectors. as europe prepares to roll out legislation aimed at accelerating the production of hydrogen, hydrogen for europe charts two potential pathways "" technology diversity "" and "" renewable push "" with an indepth look at their implications, based on actual european targets and transparent modelling frameworks. the research project looks at the technology mix, cost of the transition, and risks associated with different policy choices. it finds that the contribution of hydrogen to decarbonizing the eu \' s energy system can well exceed eu projections, with demand potentially exceeding 100 million tonnes of h2 by 2050. it also stressed the essential role played by lowcarbon hydrogen (which can be produced from natural gas in combination with ccs, or methane pyrolysis) can play in supporting the deployment of renewable hydrogen and the integration of higher volumes of renewable energy overall. in both scenarios, renewable hydrogen production scales up rapidly after 2030. however, a more diverse technology mix enables a lowercost (1 trillion less from now until 2050) and a more

chemical industry is a driving player and already supplies the homegrown essentials for going clean, circular, digitalized and climate neutral. for the chemical industry, the eu needs to ensure global

much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the euets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eubased manufactures will face an increase of at least 510 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eumade goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non eu countries, employment will also suffer. it is likely that certain european manufacturing sites will close to be ultimately relocated in non eu countries. according to a study conducted by the"", 'reference': '159', 'full_answer': 'such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not

10. 24. 24 multiple authors 24. 10. 2024 | 10 : 41am the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a, carbon brief explains how the cbam works and the impact on climate policies it is already having in the eu and around the world, as nations such as the uk and the us consider implementing cbams and related policies of

to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissionsintensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissionsintensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a

increasingly unstable world. all the technologies that are needed for the energy transition wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, evs, etc. must be made using nfms such as aluminium, copper, zinc, nickel, etc. the same is true of the digital transition where metals such as gallium, arsenic, platinum and other precious metals, etc. must be used to spur digitalisation and development of infrastructure to support the deployment of smart technology. likewise, we need antimony, aluminium, lead, etc. for our defence industry to manufacture ammunition, flak jackets, etc. without nfms made in, and for, europe we will not be able to have the strategic autonomy that we need for renewable energy, digitalisation and our defence. the need to have a european nfm industry is a first order magnitude must, otherwise we will neither have physical security, nor economic security in the months and years to come. our capacity to deliver these processed metals in europe is diminishing at a time when we should be growing the number of mines, refining, smelting and recycling facilities of nfms. since 2020, twenty such european aluminium, silicon and zinc facilities have been shuttered. this is the opposite of the strategic autonomy championed in the draghi report and is catastrophic news for our ownership of our own defence, renewable energy technology production and digitalisation. in order to rebuild the competitiveness of our nfm industry, the only way is to ensure globally competitive production costs, starting with access to energy. eurometaux has long been calling for the european commission and the member states to create the right conditions for these industrial facilities to come back into production and to invest in the development of 10 new mines for nfms, 15 new

for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while

across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we '

one of the primary objectives of the cbam is to exert pressure on nations with insufficient climate policies and incentivize them to enhance their environmental efforts. in this era, "" greenness "" has become a key determinant of competitiveness, as products boasting lower carbon footprints gain a distinct advantage in the global market. this shift is underscored by the increasing adoption of netzero targets by various enterprises and jurisdictions. it is important to design the cbam in a fair manner. i think the final design of the cbam as agreed in the legislation process is quite balanced. it introduced a threeyear transition period so that other countries \' industries and policymakers could have some time to prepare. the cbam also takes into account the free allowances, so this is rather fair for exporters too. for instance, while 1 ton of steel production might emit approximately 2 tons of co2, the actual carbon costs per ton are not necessarily two multiplied by the price of european union allowances (eua) set at 100 euros.

and decisionuseful data. through disclosures that are limited in number but of high quality and relevance, preparers of reports build trust and earn credibility with internal and external stakeholders. companies led by the members of ert are committed to the paris climate agreement. legal texts such as the eu taxonomy, corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd) / european sustainability reporting standards (esrs), corporate sustainability due diligence directive (cs3d), or the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) can help industry reach the green deal targets. however, there remain significant challenges stemming from the overlapping and often non comparable regulatory framework in the eu. the sustainability reporting requirements seem to be too focused on compliance and formalities instead of highlighting tangible actions by preparers to improve sustainability. too many individual data points are not relevant to managing or steering the company and therefore are of limited use to users. this impacts their ability to make decisions based on the disclosed information and risks shrouding the relevant information due to information overload. there are too many complex and generally vague definitions and terms, as well as unclear reporting scopes and disclosure requirements. as a result, companies, assurance providers and supervisory bodies are struggling to interpret, implement, audit and enforce these legislative acts. diverging interpretations of the legal requirements considerably reduce the comparability of disclosed information thereby undermining one of the key objectives of the legal acts. this paper sets out the key issues and proposed policy remedies for reporting under 1) the sustainable finance regulatory framework (discussing

represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 % simply cannot source their imported

carbon border adjustment mechanism, or cbam, extends the reach of the eu ets to cover imports of certain products entering the european economic area. the cbam replaces free allocation as the primary tool to protect tradeexposed sectors against carbon leakage. according to the provisional agreement reached by the council and the european parliament, the initial 3year pilot phase of cbam requires eu importers to report the greenhouse gases released during production (direct and indirect) of aluminium, cement, iron and steel, fertilizer, hydrogen, as well as electricity produced outside of the eu. the provisional agreement was preceded by long discussions on the scope and coverage of the mechanism. the goal is to extend the coverage of the mechanism to also include further commodities subject to carbon leakage, such as organic chemicals and polymers (plastics), as well as eventually all goods covered by the eu ets. once the cbam enters into force in 2027, importers will need to acquire and surrender certificates corresponding to the greenhouse gases associated with imports from outside of the eu. the cbam was introduced to promote a level playing field in terms of the regulatory burden of climate policies between producers of similar products within the eu and outside of it. in many cases its introduction will reduce the competitiveness of carbon intensive products

companies move production to countries outside the eu with less ambitious climate policies, leading to less economic activity in the eu and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the eu commission is considering implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as an alternative to the current free allocation of allowances or compensation for the increase in electricity costs. this mechanism proposes to counteract carbon leakage risk by putting a carbon price on imports of certain goods from outside the eu. ifiec supports the discussion initiated by the eu commission to incorporate an improved emission trading scheme. in this regard, the ifiec also generally welcomes all eu initiatives to improve carbon leakage protection for the european industry. the following aspects, however, should be taken into account. a cbam should only be introduced if the outstanding issues and concerns such as wto compatibility, carbon footprint assessment, certification and verification system, risk of protectionism escalation, export refunds, etc. listed below have been resolved. e a cbam should not replace already existing measures such as the eu ets free allowances and indirect cost compensation, since a cbam alone will not provide sufficient carbon leakage protection. o o it must be recognised that future free allocation of emission allowances will be further reduced, also due to new benchmarks values, so it will be a challenge to provide sufficient carbon leakage protection already from the year 2021 onwards. also, current carbon leakage protection measures should be supplemented with additional measures ensuring adequate protection for imports and exports. the cbam as proposed by the commission is solely focussing on import and does not take into account exporting sectors. due to the unforeseeable consequences of a system change, the free allocation of allowances and compensation of indirect coz costs within the electricity price should be maintained at least for a transitional period for import. for exports, it should be maintained until a structural solution is proposed. ifiec europe international federation of industrial energy

cbam is a system that imposes a carbon levy on imported goods, equivalent to the one applied to goods produced within the euand norway. this means imports with high carbon content will no longer benefit from unfair competitive advantages compared to products subject to stricter climate regulations. for norway, cbam will help protect domestic businesses from competition originating in countries with less stringent climate policies. which goods and industries are covered by cbam ?

evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their

the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver emissions reductions remains in line with keeping temperature increases in line with the goals of the paris agreement. with the launch of

""commitments to combat climate change ghg emissions from human activities have warmed the climate at an unprecedented rate. in response, both internationally and in north macedonia, policies to combat climate change have multiplied. for the private sector, beginning a decarbonisation process means actively participating in national commitments, as well as anticipating international regulations that will become increasingly stringent. the eu ' s cbam, which affects export value chains, is a fitting example. cop28, held in dubai in december 2023, has confirmed the inadequacy of international commitments. the earth ' s surface temperature has risen by 1. 1c compared to the preindustrial period. to achieve the goal of the paris agreement, namely to limit the temperature increase to 1. 5c by the end of the century, emissions must be reduced by 60 % by 2030 (compared to 2019). as a consequence, countries are expected to update their nationally determined contributions (ndcs) with 2030 targets and present new targets for 2035. this cop28 decision underscores that these new ndcs have to be more ambitious. north macedonia ' s commitment north macedonia is a low ghg emitter, accounting for 0. 02 % of global ghg emissions in 2020. the country ratified the paris agreement in november 2017 and advanced its commitment to global ghg reduction efforts by submitting an enhanced ndc in april 2021, building on its initial ndc presented in 2015. the updated ndc sets forth the objective of a 30 % reduction in co2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. the primary emphasis of the initial ndc was on mitigating climate change, especially focusing on co2 emissions produced by fossil fuel combustion, which account for nearly 80 % of the nation ' s total ghg emissions. the updated ndc mainly targets mitigation strategies, intending to integrate adaptation measures in later submissions after the required national strategic and planning frameworks are established and approved. however, the revised ndc does not currently incorporate an adaptation aspect. to succeed in this lowcarbon transition and increase competitiveness, companies are called upon to play a fundamental role by committing to invest in clean and profitable technologies. mitigation within the enhanced ndc, north macedonia introduces 63 policies and measures (pams) spanning various

multiple authors 10. 24. 24 multiple authors 24. 10. 2024 | 10 : 41am the eu \' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global emissions. in this q & a,

what are the reactions from developing countries ? are other countries introducing their own mechanisms ? what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissionsintensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissionsintensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not.

paint a surprising picture : over 75 % of companies affected by cbam are actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german

discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon

ambitious climate policies, leading to less economic activity in the eu and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the eu commission is considering implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism

carbon price on imports of certain goods from outside the eu. ifiec supports the discussion initiated by the eu commission to incorporate an improved emission trading scheme. in this regard, the ifiec also generally welcomes all eu initiatives to improve carbon leakage protection for the european industry. the following aspects, however, should be taken into account. a cbam should only be introduced if the outstanding issues and concerns such as wto compatibility, carbon footprint assessment, certification and verification system, risk of protectionism escalation, export refunds, etc. listed below have been resolved. e a cbam should not replace already existing measures such as the eu ets free allowances and indirect cost compensation, since a cbam alone will not provide sufficient carbon leakage protection. o o it must be recognised that future free allocation of emission allowances will be further reduced, also due to new benchmarks values, so it will be a challenge to provide sufficient carbon leakage protection already from the year 2021 onwards. also, current carbon leakage protection measures should be supplemented with additional measures ensuring adequate protection for imports and exports. the cbam as proposed by the commission is solely focussing on import and does not take into account exporting sectors. due to the unforeseeable consequences of a system change, the free allocation of allowances and compensation of indirect coz costs within the electricity price should be maintained at least for a transitional period for import. for exports, it should

and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will

differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in', 'reference': '920', 'full_answer': 'the latter

environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the netzero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluterpays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the

climate policy discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than

adjustment mech anism (cbam), to combat the risk of carbon leakage and maintain european industrial competitiveness under the eu green deal. context : there is a concern that eu rope ' s efforts to reach climateneu trality by 2050 could be undermined by the lack of ambition by countries outside the eu. this would mean a risk of carbon leakage. carbon leak age occurs when companies trans fer their production to countries that have lower ambitions or less strict regulatory framework for emissions. consequently, instead of eu ' s climate policy contributing to the reduction of global emissions carbon leakage results in relocating the emissions, with global emissions not being reduced. a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is foreseen to counteract the risk of carbon leakage from the eu by plac ing a carbon price on imports of cer tain goods from outside the eu. in general, ieep strongly endorses the com mission ' s commitment to decreasing green house gas (ghg) emissions, in and outside the eu as part of the green deal. however, ieep wishes to draw the attention to a number of commonly identified limita tions of the cbam in delivering eu climate policy

reconciling international subsidy rules with industrial decarbonisation environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to netzero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra) national industrial decarbonisation efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie antiforeign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonisation at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the crossborder negative economic impacts of otherwise netglobalwelfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net globalwelfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, the world trade organisation \' s trade and environment committee and wto trade and environmental sustainability structured discussions, and the coalition of trade ministers on climate. the author thanks ronald steenblik, jeromin zettelmeyer, rebecca christie, uri dadush, alicia garcia herrero, alexander lehmann, marie le mouel, ben mc williams, andre sapir and nicolas veron for their most helpful comments and critique. luca moffat is thanked for excellent research assistance. 1 introduction environmental subsidies are typically conceptualised as public spending (including governmental revenue foregone and inkind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the netzero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluterpays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition to a green economy and', 'reference': '1077', 'full_answer': 'climate versus trade ?

stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal

(cbam) 1, a measure to limit carbon leakage (the movement of production and associated emissions from one country to another due to different levels of decarbonisation effort through carbon pricing and climate regulation), by imposing a tariff on highcarbon emitting imports into the uk. having closed its consultation phase on 13 june, the final design rules are expected to be published within the next few weeks. according to the proposal, companies looking to export goods into the uk from 2027 onwards will be required to pay a tax on their scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions unless they can prove they have paid an equivalent tax in their home country. the mechanism has been developed in alignment with the uk emissions trading scheme (ets) to ensure that the carbon price paid on imported goods aligns to that currently incurred on uk manufacturers. this will help level the playing field by creating price parity between goods imported into the uk and those manufactured within. at its core, the purpose of cbam is to mitigate the risk of "" carbon leakage "", whereby carbonintensive production is offshored to countries with less stringent environmental regulations and a higher competitive advantage, ultimately resulting in equal or greater global carbon emissions overall. to limit this, sectors with large volumes of carbon emissions could face sizeable costs when exporting into the uk, unless the exporting country sets its own carbon price on par with the uk via an explicit carbon pricing scheme. in a case where the exporting country has an explicit carbon price lower than that of the uk, then the exporter would be liable to pay only the differential, rather than the full cost. cbam under the microscope until the final design rules are published, some specific

prices down, counter inflation, and spur greater innovation, today \' s era of "" weaponized interdependence "" has shown the pronounced risks that may arise from overreliance on a single source for inputs. germany experienced precisely this type of fallout when russian gas supplies were cut off following the russian invasion of ukraine, and china \' s exercise of choke points over gallium, germanium, and graphite call for similar caution and derisking. despite the need for urgent progress, the october 20 leaders \' summit produced tepid results, underscoring the difficulties in
