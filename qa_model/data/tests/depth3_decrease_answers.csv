director general gerassimos thomas of the european commission as well as the experts who designed and will implement the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). your event is very timely. if you

explain why the eu has decided to take this measure. the director general will then walk you through the mechanism, best known by its acronym : “ cbam ”. let me first recall the beginnings of cbam. our generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth : pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change. these crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50 % below normal in august and september. it impacted agriculture, energy production, and more. in europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world. we are observing these impacts not only in china and in the european union, but literally facing them all across the world. what we

reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far

commission aims to mobilise up to € 100 billion to establish a decarbonisation bank with a market based system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. the president also said that the financing would come from the eu emission trading system in a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen also talked about the important role that circularity can play in growing the european economy and how the clean industrial deal will promote it. she pointed out that 50 % of the eu ' s steel, iron, zinc, and platinum come from scrap but much more could be used. for example, she said that end of life batteries could provide 15 % of the lithium needed in europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles. that is why the clean industrial deal announces that the commission will put forward a circular economy

going to do what we promised, or what we ' re legally obliged to do, the european union which is to reach climate neutrality in 2050, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, we need to really change many of our policies. but at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will apply a new emissions trading system domestically for road transport and

start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other

dear representatives of european industries and social partners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be back with you here in antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. last year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved

make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to

states contribute about eur 80 billion in gdpand underpin over 2. 5 million jobs. steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio economic and political importance. however, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector

carbon capture and storage ; and even 40 % for wind and heat pump technology. but i know that too often, these companies struggle to grow, and to bring their solutions to industrial scale, ” she said. building on the success of the innovation fund, the commission aims to mobilise up to € 100 billion to establish a decarbonisation bank with a market based system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. the president also said that the financing would come from the eu emission trading system in a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen also talked about the important role that circularity can play in growing the european economy and how the clean industrial deal will promote it. she pointed out that 50 % of the eu ' s steel, iron, zinc, and platinum come from scrap but much more could be used. for example, she said that end of life batteries could provide 15 % of the lithium needed in europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles. that is why the clean industrial deal announces

proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or

' what is the composition of the own resources package ? the european commission proposes an amendment of the own resources decision to introduce three new categories of own resources based on : how much revenue will the package deliver ? according to the commission ' s proposal, the new own resources will be introduced gradually as of 1 january 2023. once they have reached their cruising speed, on average over the period 2026-2030, revenues for the eu budget are estimated to reach up to € 17 billion per year (in constant 2018 prices). these revenues will be used for both the repayment of next generation eu and the financing of the social climate fund. these estimates are subject to uncertainties, in particular due to the market price for carbon allowances over time and the need to work on the finalisation and subsequent implementation of the oecd / g20 inclusive framework pillar one. how will the new own resources contribute to the repayment of next generation eu ? the repayment of the borrowing for next generation eu will be spread over more than three decades, to be concluded by 2058."", 'reference': '40', 'full_answer': 'these estimates are subject to uncertainties, in particular due to the market price for carbon allowances over time and the need to work on the finalisation and subsequent implementation of the oecd / g20 inclusive framework pillar one.', 'sentence_beginning': ' these estimates are subject to uncertainties, in particular due to ', 'sentence_end': ' over time and the need to work on the finalisation and subsequent implementation of the oecd / g20 inclusive framework pillar one.', 'similarity_score': 0.7063876986503601}, {'answer': ""from russia ' s war"", 'confidence': np.float32(0.008942671), 'start': np.int64(152), 'end': np.int64(155), 'context': ""main elements what are the main conclusions of the review ? the review has drawn several conclusions : in short, a targeted revision of the mff is necessary to equip the mff with the means to ensure that the eu can meet its legal obligations and address the most urgent priorities. how much more money are you proposing ? for which programmes ? the proposal covers a targeted set of political priorities and necessary technical adjustments to the 2021-2027 budget to ensure that it can deliver until the end of the period. more concretely : does this mean additional financing by eu member states ? the mff was decided back in 2020, since then, the world has drastically changed. the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions. these effects are felt in ukraine, in the union as well as in the rest of the world including our close neighbours. while the multiannual nature of the eu budget provides stability and predictability, it has limited capacity to respond to major unexpected events, and its flexibilities are being depleted as extensive use of redeployments and reprogramming, on top of existing budgetary flexibilities, has been necessary to address the unforeseen challenges. faced with this situation, the commission sees no alternative to ensure that the eu can deliver on all its objectives, especially the most urgent ones, until the end of 2027, than to propose a targeted revision of the multiannual financial framework 2021 – 2027. how is the commission proposing to support ukraine ? the commission is proposing the creation of an integrated and flexible instrument, the ukraine facility, with an overall capacity of € 50 billion over 2024-2027. the amounts will be defined on an annual basis depending on ukraine ' s evolving needs and implementation capacities. underpinned by a ukraine plan to be presented by the government of ukraine, the ukraine facility will support ukraine ' s efforts to sustain macro financial stability, promote recovery as well as modernise the country whilst implementing key reforms on its eu accession track. the financing will be provided in the form of loans and non repayable support (‘ grants ' and guarantees), with the actual distribution being determined annually. thanks to this construction the instrument will provide certainty for a multiannual commitment and flexibility to adjust annually to evolving needs on the ground. this translates into stable and predictable funding under a framework"", 'reference': '28', 'full_answer': ""the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions."", 'sentence_beginning': ' the economic and social effects ', 'sentence_end': ' are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}]",non market overcapacity

momentum. i believe it does represent clear progress. i believe we ' re now traveling in the right direction, a direction set two years ago by the european union. the glasgow cop embraced the highest

the commission proposing a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have

amends the existing climate and energy legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or for adding to the scope small ships

decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has

'context': ""why is the commission proposing a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and

there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national

67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial

part of the 2020 agreement on the long term eu budget and next generation eu, the european parliament, eu member states in the council and the commission agreed on a roadmap to introduce new own resources to the budget to support the reimbursement of the next generation borrowing. on that basis, the commission committed to make two sets of proposals for new sources of revenue to the budget. the first proposal was presented in december 2021 and included proposals based on emissions trading system (ets), carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), and the oecd pillar one agreement. since then, little progress has been achieved. in an attempt to speed up the negotiations, the commission has today adjusted and complemented its proposal, ahead of the initially planned date of 2024. how is the final basket of proposed own resources calibrated ? in view of today ' s adjustments to the agreement on elements of fit for 55, the package of own resources to be negotiated in the council will consist of : in addition, the own resource, proposed in december 2021, based on the share of residual profits from multinationals that will be re allocated to eu member states under the oecd / g20 agreement on a re allocation of taxing rights (“ pillar one ”) is maintained. how much revenue will each of these elements deliver ? based ona carbon price assumption of € 80 per tonne, the ets own resource will generate about € 19 billion (2018 prices) per year at cruising speed, when the revenues from the new ets enter into the eu budget. it is estimated that the cbam own resource will generate about € 1. 5 billion (2018 prices) per year as of 2028. the statistical based own resource on company profits would provide revenues of about € 16 billion (2018 prices) per year as of 2024. under current assumptions, this package is expected to deliver collectively on average € 36 billion (2018 prices) per year as of 2028. how will the new own resources contribute to the repayment of

covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions

pandemic has serious consequences for europe and we now urgently need a strong signal for european cooperation and solidarity. while the figures proposed by the commission fall short of what the european parliament called for, it is good to see that the bulk of the proposal is in the form of grants. the money must now be invested in long term projects that push forward the social and ecological transformation of our economy. the climate crisis will not wait for us, and by climate proofing our investments, we ' re future proofing them as well. conditioning the funds on austerity measures is the wrong approach, as this has already failed in the past. it is important that we do not forget that the european union is based on fundamental values. those who do not respect democracy

per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free

environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate

cornerstone of the ‘ fit for 2030 ’ legislative package, which amends the existing climate and energy legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in

your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission.

demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the

fertilizer, electricity or hydrogen to the eu, you will have to report these products ' co2 emissions from 1 january 2024 onwards. today, i would like to explain why the eu has decided to take this measure. the director general will then walk you through the mechanism, best known by its acronym : “ cbam ”. let me first recall the beginnings of cbam. our generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth : pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change. these crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50 % below normal in august and september. it impacted agriculture, energy production, and more. in europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world. we are observing these impacts not only in china and in the european union, but literally facing them all across the world. what we experience already corroborates the findings of

targeted set of political priorities and necessary technical adjustments to the 2021-2027 budget to ensure that it can deliver until the end of the period. more concretely : does this mean additional financing by eu member states ? the mff was decided back in 2020, since then, the world has drastically changed. the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among

while the multiannual nature of the eu budget provides stability and predictability, it has limited capacity to respond to major unexpected events, and its flexibilities are being depleted as extensive use of redeployments and reprogramming, on top of existing budgetary flexibilities, has been necessary to address the unforeseen challenges. faced with this situation, the commission sees no alternative to ensure that the eu can deliver on all its objectives, especially the most urgent ones, until the end of 2027, than to propose a targeted revision of the multiannual financial framework

quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn

proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at

consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national

system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious target of achieving net

reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far

proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national

reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors

adjustment mechanism ? the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such

reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far

innovation fund, the commission aims to mobilise up to € 100 billion to establish a decarbonisation bank with a market based system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. the president also said that the financing would come from the eu emission trading system in a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen also talked about the important role that circularity can play in growing the european economy and how the clean industrial deal will promote it. she pointed out that 50 % of the eu ' s steel, iron, zinc, and platinum come from scrap but much more could be used. for example, she said that end of life batteries could provide 15 % of the lithium needed in europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles. that is why the clean industrial deal announces that the commission will put forward a circular economy act. “ we have to keep critical raw materials waste in europe and give it new life. this is not only good for the planet, it also supports our open strategic autonomy, ”

are in line with the climate goals agreed by the council and the european parliament. the package includes concrete proposals on how to transform the european economy in a climate friendly way and what individual sectors of the economy should do to achieve this. the name fit for 55 refers to the eu ’ s target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030. so far, so good. however, the implementation of the climate protection plans will take years, in some cases to ensure transition periods. the legislative process itself is also expected to drag on for years. mep

more climate damaging emissions than the eu. the package aims to integrate shipping and aviation into the emissions trading system, and the heating of commercial buildings and commercial road traffic.

system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious

their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to the eu ' s climate target. to reach this target,

a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts,

proposing a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out
