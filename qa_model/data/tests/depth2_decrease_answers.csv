sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio economic and political importance. however, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu.

director general gerassimos thomas of the european commission as well as the experts who designed and will implement the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). your event is very timely. if you are exporting iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizer, electricity or hydrogen to the eu, you will have to report these products ' co2 emissions from 1 january 2024 onwards. today, i would like to explain why the eu has decided to take this measure. the director general will then walk you through the mechanism, best known by its acronym : “ cbam ”. let me first recall the beginnings of cbam. our generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth : pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change. these crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50 % below normal in august and september. it impacted agriculture, energy production, and more. in europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world. we are observing these impacts not only in china and in the european union, but literally facing them all across the world. what we

accompanying initiatives adopted by the commission on the same day. first, she said, thanks to deal there will bemore investment on innovation : “ europe is a frontrunner for example in the global race for clean tech. here in europe, we have 30 % of all innovative companies in electrolyser technologies worldwide ; we have 20 % for carbon capture and storage ; and even 40 % for wind and heat pump technology. but i know that too often, these companies struggle to grow, and to bring their solutions to industrial scale, ” she said. building on the success of the innovation fund, the commission aims to mobilise up to € 100 billion to establish a decarbonisation bank with a market based system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. the president also said that the financing would come from the eu emission trading system in a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen also talked about the important role that circularity can play in growing the european economy and how the clean industrial deal will promote it. she pointed out that 50 % of the eu ' s steel, iron, zinc, and platinum come from scrap but much more could be used. for example, she said that end of life batteries could provide 15 % of the lithium needed in europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles. that is why the clean industrial deal announces that the commission will put forward a circular economy act. “ we have to keep critical raw materials waste in europe and give it new life. this is not only good for the planet, it also supports our open strategic autonomy, ” the president said. another

we need to really change many of our policies. but at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will apply a new emissions trading system domestically for road transport and

energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any

steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month)

clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and

there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national

efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border

result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions

been downgraded to junk status – just about default levels. many international companies are leaving the country. however, europe ' s sanctions-and russia ' s counter sanctions too-will have implications and also a cost for the eu economies. we will see overall higher inflation, pressure on energy and food prices, and market volatility. rising energy and commodities prices, disruptions of supply chains : it will all have a negative knock on effect on consumer prices and investment. however, uncertainty remains very high, which makes it impossible to assess reliably the economic impact at this stage. but it is clear that that growth is going to be severely impacted. on energy, we depend far too much on russia for gas, oil and coal. last year, russia provided around 45 % of the eu ' s total gas imports. for crude oil, it was also the largest supplier of eu imports. so we have to move away from russia. we have known this for years. but now it is really the time to make this move. and we intend to do so quickly. at the same time, the crisis is hitting the eu economy just when its expansion was regaining momentum after the"", 'reference': '0', 'full_answer': 'rising energy and

over the last year and a half-two years. if we are going to do what we promised, or what we ' re legally obliged to do, the european union which is to reach climate neutrality in 2050, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, we need to really change many of our policies. but at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will apply a new emissions trading system domestically for road transport and building fuels, as we need to make emissions cuts in those areas. let me be very clear, especially in the presence of members of the european
