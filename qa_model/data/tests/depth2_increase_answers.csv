steel industry is fundamental for european economy, providing critical inputs to many sectors, including automotive, construction, and defence. around five hundred production sites across 22 member states contribute about eur 80 billion in gdpand underpin over 2. 5 million jobs. steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio economic and political importance. however, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu. building on the clean transition dialogueon steel in march 2024 and follow up input, which helped form a

for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive

today ' s discussion, i would like to share some observations. first of all, let me inform you that i have asked my five colleagues, senior officials of the commission whom you know well, to join this discussion. we also have gathered today the representatives of the key strategic energy intensive sectors, including metals, fertilisers, ceramic, cement, refineries, chemicals, glass, lime, waste, pulp and paper, as well as producers of clean energy and alternative energy carriers, off takers and financial institutions. let me start by saying thatenergy intensive industries are a pillar of the eu ' s economy. you play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value. and i know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the covid 19 pandemic and then russia ' s war against ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. to mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on european businesses, the commission put in place a number of measures, including : the energy situation has now somewhat stabilised ; however today ' sgas prices are still twice as high compared to pre crisis levels. so i know the impact they have on your businesses is still very significant. and, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future. there is no silver bullet to lower them. rather, we need to double down on our overall aims. that meansaccelerating the green transition : we mustscale up renewables roll out,

trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu ' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030,

these votes represent the final step in the process of finalising these three interlinked pillars of the green deal. while the eu is reducing emissions from its own industries, emissions associated with goods imported into the eu have increased in recent years. with the introduction of the cbam, the eu has finally agreed to end ' free pollution permits ' as importers pay a pollution price, eu

zero by 2040. in return, industries that modernise and transform will get more support through the increased innovation fund and modernisation fund. the prospect of this change has already led to a

comments : we will end the free pollution party. it is now clear that industry that pollutes will pay, industry that modernizes will stay. we have achieved a strong signal to industry to reduce emissions. oil and gas will finally pay a fair price. the agreement slashes the distribution of free co2 certificates by half by 2030, and puts a complete stop to free allowances by 2034. instead industry that modernizes and transforms will get support. in this way we secure good clean industrial jobs and production to be located in europe in the future. greens / efa succeeded to fight back all attempts to weaken climate ambition, but what has been achieved is not enough to fulfill the paris agreement. renewable energies will have priority in the future. now investing in renewable

introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and

amends the existing climate and energy legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or for adding to the scope small ships

all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu ' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to the eu ' s climate target. to reach this target, the commission proposes a steeper annual emissions reduction of 4."", 'reference': '29', 'full_answer': ""what is the euemissions trading system ?

the first time i talk about the issue because it ' s one of the most debated issues in the international scene over the last year and a half-two years. if we are going to do what we promised, or what we ' re legally obliged to do, the european union which is to reach climate neutrality in 2050, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, we need to really change many of our policies. but at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will apply a new emissions trading system domestically for road transport and building fuels, as we need to make emissions cuts in those areas. let me be very clear, especially in the presence of members of the european parliament also, we believe"", 'reference': '39', 'full_answer': 'the principle is very

parliament of the report ‘ a wto compatible eu carbon border adjustment mechanism ’ provides the commission with important guidance in the eu ' s work towards our objective to make europe climate neutral by 2050 at the latest. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is an important mechanism, which, in the framework of the european green deal, will stimulate industry to invest in green solutions and will prevent unfair competition from outside the eu. s & d shadow rapporteur, mohammed chahim mep, stated : we need a level playing field. if you want your products to enter the european market, you need to embrace our climate standards. this is the very first goal of this carbon border adjustment mechanism : decreasing global co2 emissions. as social democrats we demand transparent and predictable conditions, so that industry – in and outside the eu – can adjust and get ready. therefore we need a gradual, yet rapid, phase out of the free allowances within the emission trading system (ets), once the cbam is introduced. we count on the commission to bring clarity on this matter. we will be working hard in the coming year to pass all the climate legislation from the ‘ fit for 55 package ’ to reduce emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, including the legislative proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism. the message is clear : we want the commission to come up with an ambitious proposal that sets the eu on the right side of history when it comes to fighting climate change. s & d co ordinator in the environment committee, jytte guteland mep, said : the eu is the world ' s largest carbon importer, with net imports of goods and services in the eu representing more than a fifth of the union ’ s domestic co2 emissions. obviously, this hampers our fight against climate change and undermines the important measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism can be the missing piece of the puzzle in the efforts to reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far from being a hidden tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions, the cbam can turn out to be a great asset, both for the climate and as a strong economic incentive to develop production methods with a lower greenhouse gas footprint, and can spur investments in innovation and new technologies."", 'reference': '92', 'full_answer': 'the carbon border

eu ' s competitiveness and making the eu ' s economy more prosperous, building on the recommendations of the draghi report. to boost our competitiveness and unleash growth, the eu needs to foster a favourable business environment and ensure that companies are not stifled by excessive regulatory burdens. this, in turn, will enable our businesses to grow and create quality jobs, attract investments and get the necessary funds for their transition towards a more sustainable economy and help the eu meet the green deal ' s ambitious objectives. we need to get the balance right. today, the commission is also adopting a clean industrial deal, bringing together climate and competitiveness under an overarching growth strategy. that is why the commission is recalibrating some eu rules in a growth friendly manner that will enable more cost effective delivery of our policy objectives. the commission has a clear target to deliver an unprecedented simplification effort, by achieving at least 25 % reduction in administrative burdens and at least 35 % for smes before the end of the mandate. the commission ' s work programme, published on 11 february, announced a first series of “ omnibus ” packages. they will address overlapping, unnecessary or disproportionate rules that are creating unnecessary burden for eu businesses. today ' s proposals will provide substantial simplification in the field of sustainability and eu investment programmes. the commission prioritises efforts in this area in line with the draghi report, the competitiveness compass and the findings of the commission ' s call for evidence in 2023. the package includes amendments to the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd), the corporate sustainability due diligence directive (csddd), the carbon adjustment mechanism (cbam), and the invest eu regulation. the package is accompanied by a draft taxonomy delegated act for public consultation. the aim is to square the eu ' s

year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production. i want',
