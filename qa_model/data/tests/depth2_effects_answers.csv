metals, fertilisers, ceramic, cement, refineries, chemicals, glass, lime, waste, pulp and paper, as well as producers of clean energy and alternative energy carriers, off takers and financial institutions. let me start by saying thatenergy intensive industries are a pillar of the eu ' s economy. you play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value. and i know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the covid 19 pandemic and then russia ' s war against ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. to mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on european businesses, the commission put in place a number of measures, including : the energy situation has now somewhat stabilised ; however today ' sgas prices are still twice as high compared to pre crisis levels. so i know the impact they have on your businesses is still very significant. and, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future. there is no silver bullet to lower them. rather, we need to double down on our overall aims. that meansaccelerating the green transition : we mustscale up renewables roll out, improve energy efficiency, invest in energy storage solutions and in hydrogen, and enhance our domestic manufacturing capacity of clean technologies. the european green deal plays a vital role in this. it is not only our plan to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. it is also europe ' s growth strategy. it

representatives of european industries and social partners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be back with you here in antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. last year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production.', 'reference': '54', 'full_answer': 'prime

who designed and will implement the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). your event is very timely. if you are exporting iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizer, electricity or hydrogen to the eu, you will have to report these products ' co2 emissions from 1 january 2024 onwards. today, i would like to explain why the eu has decided to take this measure. the director general will then walk you through the mechanism, best known by its acronym : “ cbam ”. let me first recall the beginnings of cbam. our generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth : pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change. these crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50 % below normal in august and september. it impacted agriculture, energy production, and more. in europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world. we are observing these

the last year and a half-two years. if we are going to do what we promised, or what we ' re legally obliged to do, the european union which is to reach climate neutrality in 2050, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, we need to really change many of our policies. but at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will apply a new emissions

industries and social partners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be back with you here in antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. last year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production. i', 'reference': '54', 'full_answer': 'prime minister, you

fundamental for european economy, providing critical inputs to many sectors, including automotive, construction, and defence. around five hundred production sites across 22 member states contribute about eur 80 billion in gdpand underpin over 2. 5 million jobs. steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio economic and political importance. however, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and

applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not

carbon border adjustment mechanism can be the missing piece of the puzzle in the efforts to reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far from being a hidden tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions, the cbam can

green deal. while the eu is reducing emissions from its own industries, emissions associated with goods imported into the eu have increased in recent years. with the introduction of the cbam, the eu has finally agreed to end ' free pollution permits ' as importers pay a pollution price, eu industry can no longer claim discounts on the eu ets price. by pricing the emissions from the manufacturing of the imported goods, the eu will encourage third countries ’ industries to decarbonise, thereby contributing to the achievement of the 1. 5 c paris target. the cbam decarbonisation incentive will increase over the next few years, as cbam will eventually cover all most polluting sectors and possibly all types of emissions. as the cbam scope is expanded, the greens / efa group will push for the eu to increase its financial support to poorer countries, which do not bear historic responsibility for climate change and should not be unfairly hit by the eu external carbon price. the reform of the eu carbon market (est ii) will incentivise the energy and industrial sectors to fully decarbonize. although the greens / efa group pushed for a more ambitious phase out of free co2 certificates, the annual number of co2 certificates to be distributed will be reduced gradually to zero by 2040. in return, industries that modernise and transform will get more support through the increased innovation fund and modernisation fund. the prospect of this change has already led to a surge in the market carbon price, which, if sustained, is likely to phase out coal in the eu already before 2030. the

i believe we ' re now traveling in the right direction, a direction set two years ago by the european union. the glasgow cop embraced the highest level of ambition of the paris agreements as our common target. we now have a global consensus on the need to limit climate change to 1. 5 degrees. ten days after cop26 this almost seems like a given but ten days before we began, the mantra was still below two degrees, and some countries even challenged the fact that paris ever spoke of 1. 5. in addition, countries that do not have national determined contributions in line with this 1. 5 degree target will have to come back next year to deliver the required update. for the first time, the parties of cop26 agreed to phase down coal and fossil fuel subsidies. whatever you may think

major unexpected events, and its flexibilities are being depleted as extensive use of redeployments and reprogramming, on top of existing budgetary flexibilities, has been necessary to address the unforeseen challenges. faced with this situation, the commission sees no alternative to ensure that the eu can deliver on all its objectives, especially the most urgent ones, until the end of 2027, than to propose a targeted revision of the multiannual financial framework 2021 – 2027. how is the commission proposing to support ukraine ? the commission is proposing the creation of an integrated and flexible instrument, the ukraine facility, with an overall capacity of € 50 billion over 2024-2027. the amounts will be defined on an annual basis depending on ukraine ' s evolving needs and implementation capacities. underpinned by a ukraine plan to be presented by the government of ukraine, the ukraine facility will support ukraine ' s efforts to sustain macro financial stability, promote recovery as well as modernise the country whilst implementing key reforms on its eu accession track. the financing will be provided in the form of loans and non repayable support (‘ grants '

increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu. building on the clean transition dialogueon steel in march 2024 and follow up input, which helped form a collective understanding of the challenges, the ambition is now to work together to craft a dedicated steel and metals action plan, to be launched in spring of this year. format and participants the steel dialogue will bring together key representatives of industry, notably steel manufacturers, suppliers of raw materials and off takers, along with representatives of social partners and civil society. it will be, chaired by president von der leyen. wider consultations with other stakeholders across the industry as well as other parts of the steel value chain will also be conducted and will feed into the steel and metals action plan, to be presented under the leadership of executive vice president for prosperity and industrial strategy stephane sejourne. the council and european parliament will be informed and consulted on the dialogue. proposed

industries and social partners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be back with you here in antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. last year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties

competitiveness compass. it identifies what we need to do to boost competitiveness, clearly highlighting the need for a competitiveness driven approach to decarbonisation. decarbonisation not only as a climate strategy but also as a clean growth strategy. we ' ll finalise the clean industrial deal at the end of the month. our goal is to present industry with a stronger business case for large climate neutral investments in energy intensive industries and clean tech. so what does this mean for tax policy ? we ' ll look into recommendations on immediate expensing and accelerated depreciation to encourage business to invest in clean tech production. we ' ll also look into if and how we update the state aid framework to ensure it ' s fit for purpose. and we ' ll continue to work on current

december), the negotiators of the european parliament, the council and the european commission reached an agreement on the revision of the european carbon market (ets) and the creation of a new eu social climate fund. the agreement sends a clear signal to industry to reduce emissions, but member states must urgently ramp up support for vulnerable households. emissions trading as a climate policy instrument is a central building block of the green deal and the fit for 55 package to achieve the eu ' s climate goal of reducing eu net emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and making the eu the first climate neutral continent by 2050. the final step is the approval of the european parliament and the council of the negotiation result. michael bloss, greens / efa shadow rapporteur on

strong signal to industry to reduce emissions. oil and gas will finally pay a fair price. the agreement slashes the distribution of free co2 certificates by half by 2030, and puts a complete stop to free allowances by 2034. instead industry that modernizes and transforms will get support. in this way we secure good clean industrial jobs and production to be located in europe in the future. greens

details of the clean industrial deal and other the accompanying initiatives adopted by the commission on the same day. first, she said, thanks to deal there will bemore investment on innovation : “ europe is a frontrunner for example in the global race for clean tech. here in europe, we have 30 % of all innovative companies in electrolyser technologies worldwide ; we have 20 % for carbon capture and storage ; and even 40 % for wind and heat pump technology. but i know that too often, these companies struggle to grow, and to bring their solutions to industrial scale, ” she said. building on the success of the innovation fund, the commission aims to mobilise up to € 100 billion to establish a decarbonisation bank with a market based system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. the president also said that the financing would come from the eu emission trading system in a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen also talked about the important role that circularity can play in growing the european economy and how the clean industrial deal will promote it. she pointed out that 50 % of the eu ' s steel, iron, zinc, and platinum come from scrap but much more could be used. for example, she said that end of life batteries could provide 15 % of the lithium needed in europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles. that is why the clean industrial deal announces that the commission will put forward a circular economy act. “ we have to keep critical raw materials waste in europe and give it new life. this is not only good for the planet, it also supports our open strategic

the moscow stock exchange remains suspended. russia ' s credit rating has been downgraded to junk status – just about default levels. many international companies are leaving the country. however, europe ' s sanctions-and russia ' s counter sanctions too-will have implications and also a cost for the eu economies. we will see overall higher inflation, pressure on energy and food prices, and market volatility. rising energy and commodities prices, disruptions of supply chains : it will all have a negative knock on effect on consumer prices and investment. however, uncertainty remains very high, which makes it impossible to assess reliably the economic impact at this stage. but it is clear that that growth is going to be severely impacted. on energy, we depend far too much on russia for gas, oil and coal. last year, russia provided around 45 % of the eu ' s total gas imports. for crude oil, it was also the largest supplier of eu imports. so we have to move away from russia. we have known this for years. but now it is really the time to make this move. and we intend to do so quickly. at the same time, the crisis is hitting the eu economy just when its expansion was regaining

honour for me to speak at this important event, so thank you for hosting it and for inviting me to address everyone. by now, none of us are strangers to the impact of the climate crisis. this summer again, we have seen unprecedented droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires, and we have all been shocked by the devastating flooding in pakistan. here in japan, the sheer force of super typhoon nanmadol and the tragic loss of life it caused were very alarming. it is as if every day, mother nature is reminding us that the window for action is closing very rapidly. we urgently need to go beyond setting commitments, to deliver steep emissions reductions in the next few years. i am very pleased that the european union and japan are strong partners in this endeavour. the eu ' s own green transformation is well underway. following russia ' s unjustified invasion of ukraine, we are moving away from fossil fuels even quicker than before. to be more secure in our energy supply, we are saving energy and speeding up the transition to renewables. in parallel, we are continuing our work to reduce emissions by at least 55 % this decade. our so called fit for 55 package strengthens climate and energy policy in nearly all economic sectors : from road transport and aviation to industry and the land sector. thanks to our emissions trading system, the eu has already cut 25 % of emissions as compared to 1990. this cap and trade system has a proven track record for energy generation and heavy industry, and now we are strengthening the system to reduce emissions even faster. we will also introduce emissions trading for maritime, buildings, and road transport. to avoid that our carbon emissions are pushed into other places – the so called carbon leakage, we are also establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). this will put a price on the carbon content of imported products made with high carbon emissions, such as steel and cement. these are just a few examples of how we are using regulation to steer europe ' s transition to net zero. in japan, you are heading to the same destination, but with a different path. i am therefore eager and curious to see how the planned green

therefore, today, i believe we ' re faced with some really, really difficult choices that will determine whether we stay within the legal boundaries we have set ourselves. reduction by 55 % by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 is not just a wish ; it is a legal obligation. and i think that should be the starting point of our discussion today. parliament was also quick to rightfully call what we ' re in a climate emergency. we saw what the floods did last year in germany, in belgium and even in the netherlands : killing people, levels of destruction we have never seen. we had a tornado in the czech republic – never before. we have completely erratic weather patterns : snow in spain when you do not expect it, droughts and floods all over the place when you do not expect it. i do not

money spent on fossil fuel bought in russia is money that disappears and putin ' s pockets and is then used to wage a war against his peaceful neighbors. this reality is the reality that should dictate the urgency of the measures we need to take. today, i would like to plead for two things. i would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets and also i would urge you to make sure that in doing this, we leave no one behind. our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy. i have to admit with all the admiration i have for what parliament has done so far, some of your positions do worry me. first, emissions trading for fuels and road transport and buildings. this is an incredibly important extra tool to tackle emissions and buildings and

alarming. it is as if every day, mother nature is reminding us that the window for action is closing very rapidly. we urgently need to go beyond setting commitments, to deliver steep emissions reductions in the next few years. i am very pleased that the european union and japan are strong partners in this endeavour. the eu ' s own green transformation is well underway. following russia ' s

renewables. in parallel, we are continuing our work to reduce emissions by at least 55 % this decade. our so called fit for 55 package strengthens climate and energy policy in nearly all economic sectors : from road transport and aviation to industry and the land sector. thanks to our emissions trading system, the eu has already cut 25 % of emissions as compared to 1990. this cap and trade system has a proven track record for energy generation and heavy industry, and now we are strengthening the system to reduce emissions even faster. we will also introduce emissions trading for maritime, buildings, and road transport. to avoid that our carbon emissions are pushed into other places – the so called carbon leakage, we are also establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). this will put a price on the carbon content of imported products made with high carbon emissions, such as steel and cement. these are just a few examples of how we are using regulation to steer europe ' s transition to net zero. in japan, you are heading to the same destination, but with a different path. i am therefore eager and curious to see how the planned green transformation

forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such measures could support"", 'reference':

a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen

sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called

eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu. building on the clean transition dialogueon steel in march 2024 and follow up input, which helped form a collective understanding of the challenges, the ambition is now to work together to craft a dedicated steel and metals action plan, to be launched in spring of this year. format and participants the steel dialogue will bring together key representatives of industry, notably steel manufacturers, suppliers of raw materials and off takers, along with representatives of social partners and civil society. it will be, chaired by president von der leyen. wider consultations with other stakeholders across the industry as well as other parts of the steel value chain will also be conducted and will feed into the steel and metals action plan, to be presented under the leadership of executive vice president for prosperity and industrial strategy stephane sejourne. the council and european parliament will be informed and consulted on

strasbourg is primarily devoted to the pieces of legislation in the so called fit for 55 package, which aim to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. in its tabling of amendments, the ecr group will pay special attention to making improvements to those files that could have a strong impact on the everyday life of citizens : revision of the eu emission

proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or

road transport fuels and buildings, which will put a price on emissions from these sectors as of 2027. the final agreement is significantly improved compared to the negotiating position adopted in june 2022. it includes several key points for the ecr group, such as additional free allowances for district heating, the removal of any conditionality clauses for access to the modernisation fund, eligibility of gas investments from the increased modernisation fund and a slower phase out of free allowances for industry. regarding the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the ets, the ecr group is of the opinion that with a gradual phase in until 2026, negotiators found a well balanced compromise. on the eu ’ s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), which aims to create a level playing field for the sectors covered by introducing a levy corresponding to the price of ets allowances on imported goods, the ecr group believes that the more cautious

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu ' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to the eu ' s climate target. to reach this target, the commission proposes a steeper annual emissions"", 'reference': '29', 'full_answer': 'this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}]",ETS benchmark update rate

our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost

from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism,

reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far
