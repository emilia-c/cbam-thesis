many changes were implemented during this commissions which will affect the outlook for eu climate policy and the eu ets. the forthcoming eu political elections bring an inevitable sense of uncertainty. questions regarding the role, architecture, and governance of the eu ets post 2030 are already being raised. some uneasiness resurfaces again with respect to impacts of regulatory interventions, as illustrated by the re power eu auction, which is seen as not transparent and unpredictable, pointing to governance concerns. this year \' s report identifies kpis to evaluate eu ets

2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the

on the notion that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment

investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are

carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought within the scope of the mechanism should be granted a sufficiently long transition period now and in the future."", 'reference': '1390',

'context': ""press release : fit for 55 package proposals : no ' green transport transition ' without a real ambitious rail strategy 9 december, the european transport ministers convened to take stock of the ongoing council of the european union discussions concerning the fit for 55 package proposals. in this context, unife wishes to reiterate how important rail ' s role is in achieving the eu ' s transport decarbonisation objectives set by the european climate law. unife welcomes the inclusion of rail in the scope of the new commission proposal for a regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (afir). however, railrelated provisions are not as ambitious as those related to other modes of transport. our sector is not properly considered in the latest discussions about the afir proposal being held at the council level. rail is by far the greenest mode of mass transportation as it accounts for less than 0. 5 % of transportrelated greenhouse gas emissions and is the only mode to both steadily improve its energy efficiency while increasing capacities. however, as of today only 54 % of the current european rail network is electrified. as these lines convey 80 % of traffic, there remain a significant number of diesel trains / locomotives in service. considering that the life cycles of rail industry assets are long for example, several decades for rail rolling stock, urgent decarbonisation measures need to be put in place now to support deployment of alternative fuels infrastructures for rail, especially for those lines that are not mandated to be electrified under the trans european network transport (tent). our association also strongly supports the provision of optional tax exemption for energy products and electricity used for goods and passenger transport by rail, metro, tram and trolley bus, called for in the energy taxation directive (etd) recast. this option would further encourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport, like rail. unife expects other instruments, such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) and the eu emissions trading system (ets) reform, to curb emissions while providing additional revenue to be invested in innovation and lowcarbon rail infrastructure that would further decrease the sector carbon footprint. our members urgently call on european member states to carefully reconsider the following elements when continuing discussions on the fit for 55 proposals under the french presidency of the council, coming to office in january 2022 : there will be no decarbonisation transition of the european transport sector without rail. the deployment of rail alternative fuels solutions is essential to achieve climate neutrality objectives. the analysis of

european union (eu) will begin to charge third countrybased cement exporters for the co2 emissions of their products sold inside the bloc. the new carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a lynchpin in the strategy to reduce eu industries ' co2 emissions by 55 % between 1990 and 2030. starving foreign cement industries of a source of income may also help to make them change their ways. a regional solution leveraged through an unfair head start, however, might cause progress to falter where it is most needed in the global fight against climate change. carbon leakage has hung over the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) since its inception in 2005. cembureau, the european cement association, reported a 300 % fiveyear increase in thirdcountry cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92mworth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free allocations were always expected to phase out in a mirror image of the cbam phasein. the proposal eventually adopted on 22 june 2022 set the end date for both as 2032. in 2020, the eu imported us $ 383mworth of cement and concrete

the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 % simply cannot source their imported cbam goods from eu suppliers many handle shipments with hundreds of different skus most deal"", 'reference': '849', 'full_answer': 'as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders.', 'sentence_beginning': ' as eu manufacturers ', 'sentence_end': ' through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders.', 'similarity_score': 0.7611746191978455}, {'answer': '?

decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to

number of comments on the reporting under the cba. in particular, the mechanism of carbon adjustment of imports has already been dubbed "" bureaucratic madness "" in the eu. this was reported by

on carbon emissions associated with the production of goods outside the european union. but even at this stage, the employees of european companies responsible for submitting cbam reports have questions, the answers to which they are trying to find out at technical briefings organized by the european commission \' s tax department. the three most important questions are what, who, and where to file. what ? suppliers currently submit documents to iso 14067, the current global standard for quantifying productrelated co2 emissions. however, according to the cbam regulations, it cannot be used in the future. however, the european commission has not yet explained which regulation should be used when reporting. who ? officials explain that the reporting itself can be submitted only if the product importer has a representative office in the eu. otherwise, he must appoint someone in his place. if a company appoints an organization to handle its reporting, it can do so for all eu countries. a representative of the european commission explained that in the third quarter of 2024, companies from non eu countries will receive "" conditions and procedures to follow "" to authorize

steel mills. think again. the numbers paint a surprising picture : over 75 % of companies affected by cbam are actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their
