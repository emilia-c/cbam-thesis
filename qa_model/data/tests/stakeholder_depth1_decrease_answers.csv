number of comments on the reporting under the cba. in particular, the mechanism of carbon adjustment of imports has already been dubbed "" bureaucratic madness "" in the eu. this was reported by euractiv. the transitional period, which is currently underway in the process of implementing the world \' s first climate import duty, only provides for the collection of data without paying a duty on carbon emissions associated with the production of goods outside the european union. but even at this stage, the employees of european companies responsible for submitting cbam reports have questions, the answers to which they are trying to find out at technical briefings organized by the european commission \' s tax department. the three most important questions are what, who, and where to file. what ? suppliers currently submit documents to iso 14067, the current global standard for quantifying productrelated co2 emissions. however, according to the cbam regulations, it cannot be used in the future. however, the european commission has not yet explained which regulation should be used when reporting. who ? officials explain that the reporting itself can be submitted only if the product importer has a representative office in the eu. otherwise, he must appoint someone in his place. if a company appoints an organization to handle its reporting, it can do so for all eu countries. a representative of the european commission explained that in the third quarter of 2024, companies from non eu countries will receive "" conditions and procedures to follow "" to authorize a representative to submit reports on their behalf. where ? the international chamber of commerce (icc) previously warned of "" serious compliance challenges facing companies of all sizes "" due to

additional errors in the system. in germany, the platform was down for several weeks after the start of the cbam transition period due to the lack of a responsible authority. the mechanical

adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu '

exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage

market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbonneutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? the transformation to carbonneutrality is complex. for tata steel this means transforming our production process while still producing steel in the traditional way and also maintaining the highquality standards. furthermore, it is also a political challenge. the transformation of european industry means facilitating the transformation of companies in transition like tata steel nederland for example through financial measures and faster permitting processes. at the same time, the right (framework) conditions need to be established : ensuring the necessary sufficient clean energy production, competitive network cost and also creating a market for clean products like green steel. all in a european level playing field situation, also on (energy) taxation and exemptions. this happens in a challenging context, where the european steel industry is facing significant pressures due to competition from third countries especially our strategic rivals. market steel : what do you see as the biggest challenges to decarbonisation, and how could european policymakers help to address them ? given the challenges faced by the entire european steel industry, the european commission needs to enact a steel action plan, aiming at solving the immediate issues faced by industry and facilitating the clean transformation of steel companies. market steel : green hydrogen is a key component of europe ' s decarbonisation strategy. what specific steps should european policymakers take to promote the production and availability of green hydrogen in europe ?
