trade ? reconciling international subsidy rules with industrial decarbonisation environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to netzero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra) national industrial decarbonisation efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie antiforeign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonisation at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the crossborder negative economic impacts of otherwise netglobalwelfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net globalwelfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, the world trade

and inkind contributions) that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the netzero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluterpays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public

and lowcarbon industrial production. setting the scene the european carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is the first instrument of its kind and is already set to become the testing ground for future border carbon adjustments (bcas) all over the world. accordingly, many discussions have been raised on the implementation of the cbam, including what would be the best way to allocate the revenues raised thanks to the mechanism. energy intensive industries within europe have called for these revenues to be clearly allocated domestically to accelerate the development of lowcarbon technologies and decarbonise energy intensive sectors.

the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments

in order to meet increasing spending demands, not least repayment of debt incurred as part of the eu \' s postpandemic economic recovery. in particular it is seen as desirable that the eu should have \' own \' resources, or reliable ongoing revenue streams. but there is little agreement on what new own resources could consist of. limited reform so far has led to the introduction of a levy paid by eu members depending on plastic packaging waste generated in their territory and not recycled. meanwhile, the european commission has proposed resources for the eu budget from emissions trading revenues, and from levies collected under the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). there proposals are pragmatic and move in the right direction, but do not go far enough. the debate about own resources should focus on whether the eu will be able to build genuine own resources based on common tax policies. the eu suffers from \' tax leakage \' in which profits are shifted from hightax to lowtax eu countries, and from there onto no or lowtax non eu jurisdictions, often without the application of withholding taxes. it may not be too much ofa stretch to compare this situation of tax leakage with the situation addressed by cbam a quasitax at the border. so far, an opportunity for what could be seen as a tax at the border of the internal market, aiming to protect the market from harmful competition, may have been missed. such a tax could reflect the undertaxed profit rule agreed as part of the international deal on the corporate minimum tax. focusing on protecting the revenues of eu members by common tax borders could offer scope for new own resources. bruegel recommended citation saint amans, p.

climate policy discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by

eu carbon border adjustment mecha nism (cbam), a part of the reform of the european emissions trading system (eu ets), will come into effect. currently, energyintensive industries do not need to purchase all of the necessary eu ets allowances on the market to remain globally competitive, as the remaining allowances are freely allocated to them. the cbam plans to gradually replace free allowances with a price on the carbon emissions embedded in imports. following a transitionalprimarily monitoring phase, this price on embedded emissions will be gradually introduced from 2026 on the imports of certain products. while the cbam can mitigate carbon leakage, production declines in greenhousegas intensive industries as a result of limiting free allowances, and rising carbon prices, it cannot compensate for them completely. in particular, the cbam does not provide sufficient protection for exporters to non eu coun tries. it is crucial that the cbam does not lead to trade con flicts that would make multilateral cooperation more difficult. international cooperation is indispensable, as it is the only way to reduce global emissions. the european union (eu) has set a goal to become

speeding up of the system ' s introduction, the earlier phasing out of free allowances, the addition of three product categories, and the creation of a cbam authority. the confederation of swedish enterprise finds some of these proposals problematic. the rapporteur for the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), mohammed chahim (s & d, the netherlands), has presented his draft report to the european parliament ' s committee on the environment, public health and food safety. swedish enterprise believes that speeding up the introduction of the system would be unrealistic and therefore, we would argue against rushing it through. more importantly, phasing out the free allowances at the speed proposed by chahim is not a wise policy given the many uncertainties regarding how cbam would work and its effect on european competitiveness. hence, swedish enterprise stands by its previous line that free allowances can be phased out, but there should be regular checks along the way to assess the effects on european firms ' external competitiveness. if competitiveness deteriorates, then free allowances should be maintained to some extent, (and granted in commensurate levels to importers, to avoid protectionism). cbam is a tool to create a level playing field in the eu, as imports would have to bear the same climate costs as domestic production. however, cbam does nothing to create such a level playing field outside the eu. on the contrary, introducing cbam and phasing out free allowances may create competitive disadvantages for eu firms in third country markets. chahim acknowledges this but he has no concrete idea for how to address the issue. it should be added that reduced european exports to third markets may be negative for the climate as european products in general are more climatefriendly than products produced in third countries. swedish enterprise supports the immediate inclusion of indirect emissions in the system. apart from the climate aspects of such a policy, it also eliminates distortion in the eu single market. swedish enterprise is skeptical about the addition of three extra product categories to cbam. this is a highly complex area and moderation needs to be applied when cbam is introduced. for example, the commission has argued against the inclusion of organic chemicals. rejecting this without a thorough analysis risks damaging the climate and european competitiveness. swedish enterprise has no position on the creation of a cbam authority. such a body seems superfluous though ,"",

while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in the longterm, today \' s communication presents a plan for a new framework for business

adjustment mechanism (cbam) as part of the eu green deal policy portfolio. as an ngo with decades of experience in the field of industrial decarbonisation policies, we hold the view that in the current policy context, the cbam is a unique environmental policy instrument in the outcomes it encourages, such as the promotion of netzero industrial transformation, both within and outside the eu. the answers to the questionnaire provided by the european commission as part of its public consultation on the topic, are based on the vision and policy expertise outlined below, which includes technical considerations. a cbam is required to ensure the full effectiveness of europe ' s new sustainable growth strategy, the european green deal. as an environmental policy tool, with a trade and competitiveness dimension, it will enable the eu to take fuller responsibility for the carbon footprint of its imports as well as encouraging and incentivising increased climate ambition and robust monitoring and verification of emissions worldwide. the proposed cbam works as a guarantee of a responsible approach to the eu green deal, both for eu based industries and outside jurisdictions by providing a continuous incentive for ever lower emissions (with concrete economic savings in doing so). this can help increase worldwide climate ambition, or at the very minimum ensure that the eu green deal does not lead to emissions increasing elsewhere on the globe. secondly, a cbam will address the risks of carbon in a netzero by 2050 european union, ensuring a level playing field based on embedded carbon and indirect emissions, driving climate advancements in the eu while mindful of the need to curtail an increase in demand of high carbon goods and products elsewhere. this would be an enhancement from the current situation where disproportionate competitive advantages derive from differing carbon pricing landscapes across various jurisdictions. due to the incentives it provides for solid transformation of the industrial sectors towards a zeroemissions landscape, there is no other policy mechanism that provides the same range of environmental benefits (as listed below). however,

ets. once the cbam enters into force in 2027, importers will need to acquire and surrender certificates corresponding to the greenhouse gases associated with imports from outside of the eu. the cbam was introduced to promote a level playing field in terms of the regulatory burden of climate policies between producers of similar products within the eu and outside of it. in many cases its introduction will reduce the competitiveness of carbon intensive products manufactured outside of the region. many of the immediate considerations of the cbam ' s potential impact centre around countries who are key exporters of the affected products to the eu and therefore immediately and directly implicated. in this blog, we look at the exposure of major southeast asian economies to cbam in its likely future form (coverage including plastics as per proposal of eu parliament) and apply an economic model (climtrade) to appraise several broader considerations that may arise from distortions to global trade flows. does cbam pose a risk to countries exporting to the eu ? producers that are either currently exporting to the eu, or intend to in the future, now have an extra incentive to consider the climate footprint of their activities. and the policy has the potential to impact trade flows beyond just those channelled into the eu. for example, if eu demand for imported steel falls as a result of cbam, this can alter"", 'reference': '178', 'full_answer': 'in many cases its introduction will reduce the competitiveness of carbon intensive products manufactured outside
