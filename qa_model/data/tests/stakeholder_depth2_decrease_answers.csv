steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount

2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the

interview, we will be speaking with carlos monreal, founder and ceo of plastic energy. join us as we delve deeper into the efforts of plastic energy to tackle the issue of plastic waste and create value from it. plastic waste is a global problem that has far reaching environmental impacts, and plastic energy is a company that aims to address this issue. founded by carlos monreal more than a decade ago, the company has been developing its unique tac process for plastic waste. our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company has projects in europe, asia, and

efficacy, which supports the demands for transparency and confirmation of ethical practices within mining and steel manufacturing supply chains. the steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new

for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action

post pandemic economic recovery. in particular it is seen as desirable that the eu should have \' own \' resources, or reliable ongoing revenue streams. but there is little agreement on what new own

meanwhile, the european commission has proposed resources for the eu budget from emissions trading revenues, and from levies collected under the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). there proposals are pragmatic and move in the right direction, but do not go far enough. the debate about own resources should focus on whether the eu will be able to build genuine own resources based on common tax policies. the eu suffers from \' tax leakage \' in which profits are shifted from high tax to low tax eu countries, and from there onto no or low tax non eu jurisdictions, often without the application of withholding taxes. it may not be too much ofa stretch to compare this situation of tax leakage with the situation addressed by cbam-a quasi tax at the border. so far, an opportunity for what could be seen as a tax at the border of the internal market, aiming to protect the market from harmful competition, may have been missed. such a tax could reflect the undertaxed profit rule

already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and

circular goes further and encompasses the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to end of life. imagine a thrift store versus a product designer who considers reuse and recycling from the start. linear supply chain the opposite of a circular supply chain is a linear supply chain. the raw materials are sourced, produced, used, and discarded. while most companies currently operate their supply chain as a linear flow of goods, recycling companies and second hand dealers and shops take their linear products and try to reuse them. it is crucial to learn that having a linear organization does not mean that your product is also used linearly. creating a circular supply chain creating it requires a holistic approach that involves all stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. the process involves four key steps : design for sustainability : the first step is to design products with sustainability in mind, considering the entire product lifecycle and its environmental impact. optimize resource utilization : the next step is to optimize resource utilization by reducing waste and maximizing renewable sources. implement reverse logistics : the third step is reverse logistics, where products are collected and returned to the supply chain for refurbishment, remanufacturing, or recycling. foster collaboration : finally,

improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent blockchain network, stakeholders in the

which span a large number of issues. the reason why the latest industrial strategy, dated march 2020, is already being updated is, of course, the result of covid 19. the day after the publication of the strategy, this was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization. the pandemic has had a major impact on both the economy and on business within the eu, in both the short and long term. in the short term, the crisis has led to job losses and financial problems for many businesses, particularly in a number of vulnerable sectors. this has led to extensive government support measures in order to save companies in crisis. however, it has also highlighted weaknesses in the eu ' s single market and in international trade, with unforeseen barriers and broken value chains, with a shortage of goods and closing entire industries. the pandemic will also have many long term effects ; structural transformation in the form of digitisation and conversion to more sustainable production is likely to be accelerated. the single market will be strengthened, and trade will be opened up and diversified to reduce vulnerability to the next crisis one which no one can predict ; how it will look or how it will manifest itself. the pandemic is not the only thing creating pressure for new proposals in the updated industrial strategy. at the center of this are the discussions on how the eu can best assert itself globally when it comes to being at the forefront of economic and technological development. not least, it is about ensuring that the competitiveness of eu business is properly promoted when public funds are invested in selected research projects for the technologies of the future, and that companies can work jointly to develop the best solutions. in addition, it must be about the public sector setting out properly functioning rules, allowing companies to then compete to develop the best solutions on a level playing field. we will examine this in more detail

current approach of emissions reporting under the commission implementing regulation (eu) 2023 / 1773 consists of measuring actual embedded emissions of imported products by tracing them back to the individual manufacturing plants where they were produced. although it may make reporting very accurate and create incentives for eu trade partners to export low emission products to the eu, this is not what the cbam was made for. more importantly, it undermines the cbam \' s initial goal and, therefore, threatens the sustainability of the eu emissions trading system (ets). example : the scrap loophole the emissions reporting method currently in place during the transitional phase creates incentives to export low carbon products to the eu, but that does not make exporters reduce their emissions. for example, making steel and aluminium products from recycled metal scrap emits much less co2 than if done by transforming freshly mined materials. both metals are already recycled widely in most countries and blended (or not) with freshly transformed primary materials to create new products. steel and aluminium exporters can therefore reduce the cbam fees charged for their products by strategically blending large amounts of scrap into products sold to the eu (subject to cbam fees) and less for products sold to other markets (not covered by cbam fees), without reducing their average carbon intensity. such circumvention would be perfectly legal but make imports pay less for embedded emissions than eu products, for which the blend of scrap is limited, on average, to the proportion

companies importing goods into the eu will have to purchase cbam certificates and then surrender the required amount to cover the corresponding emissions each year. there are no limits on the number of cbam certificates an importer may purchase so as to avoid imposing restrictions on trade. unlike ets allowances, cbam certificates are not tradeable nor bankable to ensure they constantly reflect the evolution of the ets price, as any divergence could create disparities in price so wide that they could weaken the incentives for decarbonization between domestic and imported goods. certificates are valid for two years from the date of purchase. re purchasing is the only form of "" transaction "" allowed on cbam certificates. an importer can re sell its certificates in excess-up to a third of the total certificates purchased the year before-to the competent authority. this should preserve some flexibility and the possibility for importers to opt', 'reference': '1152', 'full_answer': 'unlike ets allowances, cbam certificates are not tradeable nor bankable to ensure they constantly reflect the evolution of the ets price, as any divergence could create disparities in price so wide that they could weaken the incentives for decarbonization between domestic and imported goods.', 'sentence_beginning': ' unlike ets allowances, cbam certificates are not tradeable nor bankable to ensure they constantly reflect the evolution of the ets price, ', 'sentence_end': ' so wide that they could weaken the incentives for decarbonization between domestic and imported goods.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}]",default values in CBAM

in depth, and comment on the various parts of the strategy, which span a large number of issues. the reason why the latest industrial strategy, dated march 2020, is already being updated is, of course, the result of covid 19. the day after the publication of the strategy, this was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization. the pandemic has had a major impact on both the economy and on business within the eu, in both the short and long term. in the short term, the crisis has led to job losses and financial problems for many businesses, particularly in a number of vulnerable sectors. this has led to extensive government support measures in order to save companies in crisis. however, it has also highlighted weaknesses in the eu ' s single market and in international trade, with unforeseen barriers and broken value chains, with a shortage of goods and closing entire industries. the pandemic will also have many long term effects ; structural transformation in the form of digitisation and conversion to more sustainable production is likely to be accelerated. the single market will be strengthened, and trade will be opened up and diversified to reduce vulnerability to the next crisis one which no one can predict ; how it will look or how it will manifest itself. the pandemic is not the only thing creating pressure for new proposals in the updated industrial strategy. at the center of this are the discussions on how the eu can best assert itself globally when it comes to being at the forefront of economic and technological development. not least, it is about ensuring that the competitiveness of eu business is properly promoted when public funds are invested in selected research projects for the technologies of the future, and that companies can work jointly to develop the best solutions. in addition, it must be about the public sector setting out properly functioning rules, allowing companies to then compete to develop the best solutions on a level playing field. we will examine this in more detail later in this article. as i said, the industrial strategy is about numerous parts

significant. for example, spain imported 14. 5 million tons of steel in 2022, half of which came from outside the eu. assuming an average carbon intensity of steel and the current eu carbon price, spanish steel importers could face annual tariffs of some 1 billion euros when cbam regulations are fully enforced in 2034. while the levies will initially apply only to a relatively small number of

carbon leakage from domestic energy intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price-on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs of the covered sectors in europe and internationally. by addressing the risk of carbon leakage, the cbam aims to safeguard the reduction of global emissions within its scope. though the ultimate objective of the cbam is to cover a wide range of products, the current proposal covers a limited number of sectors deemed to be at high risk of carbon leakage and for which the introduction of the measure is administratively and technically feasible. the selected sectors are iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, and electricity, with extended coverage of 56 categories of goods down the value chain. to unpack the multiple layers of the cbam proposal and allow for an analysis of their implications, it is necessary to identify the multiple and often intertwined elements of its scope and affected stakeholders. the existing literature points to at least the following elements (marcu et al., 2020,2021) : policy mechanism or design, coverage of trade flows (i. e. imports, exports),

carbon leakage from domestic energy intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price-on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs of the covered sectors in europe and internationally. by addressing the risk of carbon leakage, the cbam aims to safeguard the reduction of global emissions within its scope. though the ultimate objective of the cbam is to cover a wide range of products, the current proposal covers a limited number of sectors deemed to be at high risk of carbon leakage and for which the introduction of the measure is administratively and technically feasible. the selected sectors are iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, and electricity, with extended coverage of 56 categories of goods down the value chain. to unpack the multiple layers of the cbam proposal and allow for an analysis of their implications, it is necessary to identify the multiple and often intertwined elements of its scope and affected stakeholders. the existing literature points to at least the following elements (marcu et al., 2020,2021) : policy mechanism or design, coverage of trade flows (i. e. imports, exports),

these reasons, grupa azoty tentatively supports the idea of a cbam, provided that (a) its main objective is to encourage non eu producers to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, (b) eu carbon leakage avoidance schemes (mainly, free allowances) are not weakened, and (c) wto compatibility is ensured by keeping the system non discriminatory towards non eu exporters, as close to ets as possible, with solid reliance on gatt article xx where required. grupa azoty also believes that the fertilizer sector should be covered by the cbam for the following reasons : 1. eu fertilizer producers have already made significant contribution to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions, by practically eliminating n2o emissions and approaching technological limits for co2 process emissions from ammonia. 2. our sector has clearly paid the price for ets by suffering carbon leakage : exports are down, imports are up, eu companies are taken over by non eu producers from countries with no

producers to limit their own emissions. 5. it is simple to calculate emissions in the fertilizer sector, because they occur in only two points of production and most of emissions are directly related to consumption of key raw material. 6. most imports to the eu in our sector originate in a handful of countries, with a small number of producing exporters, making cbam manageable at the border. grupa

challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering,

exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a

mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu '

cornerstone of the eu ' s efforts to combat climate change. launched in 2005, it is the world ' s first and largest carbon market in terms of trading volume and value. the eu ets covers various sectors, including power generation, heavy industry and aviation within the european economic area (eea). it will soon be extended to maritime transport, while a parallel scheme will be established for fuels consumed by buildings and road vehicles. the eu ets works by obliging all companies under its scope to surrender ' allowances ', i. e. pollution permits, for their greenhouse gas emissions. one allowance provides the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets. since companies can trade allowances freely with each other, their price is determined by supply and demand. for the first time, in 2023 the eu ets allowance price exceeded 100. how are eu ets allowances allocated ? there are two ways to obtain allowances under the eu ets. the main way is to buy them, either at auction (primary market) or from other companies (secondary market). auctions take place daily at the european energy exchange (eex). allowances can be traded on the secondary market at any time, either directly between buyers and sellers, or indirectly through intermediaries. an alternative way to obtain allowances is to receive them from the authorities for free. during the first compliance years of the eu ets, almost all allowances were distributed to companies for free. since 2008, the percentage of freely allocated allowances has been progressively decreasing. the share of free allowances decreased from 80 % in 2013 to 30 % in 2020 (eu ets directive, article 10a

famous butterfly effect rests on the notion that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s

also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported

imports based on their emissions. paired with a domestic carbon price, it aims to prevent carbon leakage companies moving their emitting activities to other countries and lead to an overall reduction in emissions. in 2023, the eu started its cbam the first to be implemented globally. this was met with a strong reaction from other countries, such as china, south africa, india and brazil, which criticised the mechanism for placing an unfair burden on developing countries and for breaking wto rules. the eu cbam will likely only reduce emissions slightly on top of the eu emissions trading system currently in place. an eu carbon price of usd 88 on all emissions reduces emissions by 21 %, and the introduction of the cbam only adds another 1. 3 percentage points. modelling suggests that the eu cbam could cost developing countries usd 10. 2 billion, with some countries, like zimbabwe and india, most exposed. the introduction of the eu cbam has led to the announcement of more climate and international trade measures worldwide as countries try to limit their exposure to it. thus far, this has resulted in an uncoordinated and confusing policy landscape. to ensure that climate and trade policies work to reduce global emissions, they should be aligned with unfccc principles and should provide exemptions to avoid placing additional burdens on developing countries. a carbon border adjustment mechanism is a carbon tariff on imports a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a policy that charges a carbon price on certain types of imports based on the amount of carbon emissions associated with their production. when paired with domestic carbon pricing, it aims to "" level the playing field "" : a cbam aims to ensure that when a carbon price is put in place, the higher prices for carbon intensive domestic goods do not lead to more imports of cheap, carbon intensive goods from countries where carbon taxes are not in place. it aims to prevent \' carbon leakage \', where carbon intensive activities are moved to another location with less regulation on emissions, instead of being reduced, resulting in no overall decrease in emissions. in the absence of domestic carbon pricing, a cbam functions as a border tariff targeting carbon intensive production and is not likely to contribute to further emissions reductions. eu cbam has sparked discussions on

emissions by 2053. the nationally determined contribution (ndc) has been updated, renewable energy investments have increased, and the green deal action plan has been implemented. however, challenges

adjustment mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu

has been touted as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in

starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs

application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help fight climate change by putting a tax on raw materials based on their co2 emissions, it would not only fall short of its very objective but also drive production and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbon intensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu, but it also negatively affects european competition, ultimately creating an incentive for industrial delocalisation and jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eu based manufactures will face an increase of at least 5-10 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non

for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair ""

like antidumping and anti subsidy tariffs as well as safeguards ; policymakers should first carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors (eg. steel, cement). if the cbam also covers the carbon content for indirect emissions in the imported product, then it must also reflect the additional indirect costs european producers face compared to other global producers, in order to ensure a global level playing field (due to marginal pricing in european power markets, indirect costs are not directly correlated to indirect emissions, as explained in this paper). hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the cbam. the two can co exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. overall, designing a

under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product.

allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu

we analyze the proposals in depth, and comment on the various parts of the strategy, which span a large number of issues. the reason why the latest industrial strategy, dated march 2020, is already being updated is, of course, the result of covid 19. the day after the publication of the strategy, this was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization. the pandemic has had a major impact on both the economy and on business within the eu, in both the short and long term. in the short term, the crisis has led to job losses and financial problems for many businesses, particularly in a number of vulnerable sectors. this has led to extensive government support measures in order to save companies in crisis. however, it has also highlighted weaknesses in the eu ' s single market and in international trade, with unforeseen barriers and broken value chains, with a shortage of goods and closing entire industries. the pandemic will also have many long term effects ; structural transformation in the form of digitisation and conversion to more sustainable production is likely to be accelerated. the single market will be strengthened, and trade will be opened up and diversified to reduce vulnerability to the next crisis one which no one can predict ; how it will look or how it will manifest itself. the pandemic is not the only thing creating pressure for new proposals in the updated industrial strategy. at the center of this are the discussions on how the eu can best assert itself globally when it comes to being at the forefront of economic and technological development. not least, it is about ensuring that the competitiveness of eu business is properly promoted when public funds are invested in selected research projects for the technologies of the future, and that companies can work jointly to develop the best solutions. in addition, it must be about the public sector setting out properly functioning rules, allowing companies to then compete to develop the best solutions on a level playing field. we will examine this in more detail later in this article. as i said, the industrial strategy is about numerous parts

the registry could play a pivotal role in facilitating smoother operations. furthermore, the registry offers an opportunity for competent authorities to share the burden of challenging third country operators when data are missing or lack precision. while these opportunities are promising, clepa emphasises the need to address several pressing issues to ensure the cbam is both effective and manageable. 1. access to data remains a critical challenge. one of the main challenges in the cbam is the lack of access to accurate and timely emissions data. a recent survey of clepa members revealed that 65 % of automotive suppliers receive actual emissions data from less than 10 % of their own suppliers. this significant data gap underscores the difficulty of tracking and reporting emissions, particularly for iron and steel products that move through multiple layers of the supply chain. additional barriers include the inability to switch suppliers due to existing contractual obligations or the need for regulatory approvals, including complex safety certifications. we recommend allowing the use of default or industry standard emissions values until a substantial portion of suppliers can provide verified data. we further suggest excluding one time shipments (e. g., for testing purposes) and incorporating provisions for samples and non recurring deliveries. 2. administrative burden and compliance costs. the current administrative requirements of cbam pose substantial challenges. the administrative burden and costs can amount to several hundred thousand euros per reporting period. while the cbam registry is already a step forward, we recommend the commission to continue addressing the administrative burden issue. one suggestion would be to streamline the excel template by focusing on mandatory fields and anticipated future needs (e. g. direct vs. indirect emissions after 2026). to further support compliance, we suggest translating key documents into key partner languages. 3. proposal for a weight based and cbam registration threshold. the current cbam applies uniform reporting requirements when the value of the shipment is eur 150 or more. we believe that a weight based per shipment threshold would be a more practical and efficient approach. this has proved effective in the risk based implementation of the reach regime, where a 1t

the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) the carbon border adjustment mechanism the transition phase of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) began in october 2023. during this transition phase, companies must submit quarterly reports until the end of 2025 listing the embedded emissions of imported goods subject to cbam. the first report was due on january 31,2024. from january 1,2026, cbam will come into full force and companies will have to gradually purchase cbam certificates according to the embedded emissions of the imported goods. the free allocation for installations in the eu ets that produce these cbam goods will then gradually decrease accordingly, resulting in enormous co2 costs for european manufacturers of steel, aluminum, cement and fertilizers, which will burden them and their customers. the german business community supports the paris climate goals, the objectives of the green deal and protection against carbon leakage, as there is no international level playing field. however, the current design and implementation of the cbam raises major questions and poses enormous chal-lenges for affected companies and sectors.

""o carbon market watch cmw ' s position on the carbon border adjustment mechanism societies and businesses face increasing uncertainty due to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, instability in global energy and commodity markets, and unclear climate commitments by key international partners. in this context, the european green deal provides a broad and strong suite of policy tools that have the power to create the necessary stability and certainty to succeed in the transition to climate neutrality. to this end, the european commission suggested the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) as an instrument to support the reduction of eu greenhouse gas emissions while also creating incentives for higher climate ambition from international trading partners. it also further identified it as an alternative to the eu emissions trading system (ets) carbon leakage protection measures such as free allowances and indirect cost compensation. the cbam has the potential to create a first mover advantage for eu industry in the global race to decarbonization. this will only be possible if this tool is designed to provide real incentives for industries within and outside europe to reduce their emissions, and demonstrates recognition and understanding for other countries ' need and right to develop. it should also recognize that the relative impacts of carbon prices can be much higher for low income countries. moreover, cbam should be discussed alongside diplomatic efforts to encourage and support trading partners to speed up their efforts towards climate mitigation and adaptation. it is essential to recognize that the cbam will not be a silver bullet, neither for decarbonising the eu ' s industrial base nor encouraging action at the global level. to be successful at home, the cbam needs to be part of a broad policy toolbox for decarbonising eu ' s heavy industry. that includes measures seizing the full potential of circular economy approaches, support for near-zero emissions technologies and regulation to build demand for clean materials and products, notably through the setting of carbon footprinting requirements. internationally, a cbam should be used to leverage a broader discussion on decarbonising heavy industry and better aligning trade and climate policy. particularly, it opens new areas for cooperation

already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also

some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than

the european commission \' s proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) puts forward a policy measure to prevent carbon leakage from domestic energy intensive and trade exposed industries by leveling production costs of european and international markets. from the perspective of swedish climate ambitions and industry competitiveness, four important elements of the proposal include (1) the timeline of the free allowance phase out, (2) the exclusion of exports from its coverage, (3) the scope of emissions covered, and (4) crediting third countries \' climate policies. this discussion brief explores the various options for these issues, as well as swedish stakeholders \' views on them. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate policy measure put forward by the european commission under the european green deal. the measure aims to address the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions of energy intensive industries due to the introduction of climate policies, or "" carbon leakage "" (see box 1). according to the proposal, the cbam would impose an embedded carbon price based on the average weekly eu emissions trading system (eu ets) auctioning price-on imported goods from specific sectors in the form of certificates. this would effectively level the production costs of the covered sectors in europe and internationally. by addressing the risk of carbon leakage, the cbam aims to safeguard the reduction of global emissions within its scope. though the ultimate objective of the cbam is to cover a wide range of products, the current proposal covers a limited number of sectors deemed to be at high risk of carbon leakage and for which the introduction of the measure is administratively and technically feasible. the selected sectors are iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, and electricity, with extended coverage of 56 categories of goods down the value chain. to unpack the multiple layers of the cbam proposal and allow for an analysis of their implications, it is necessary to identify the multiple and often intertwined elements of its scope and affected stakeholders. the existing literature points to at least the following elements (marcu et al., 2020,2021) : policy mechanism or design, coverage of trade flows (i. e. imports, exports), geographic scope, sectoral scope, emissions scope,

commission has proposed resources for the eu budget from emissions trading revenues, and from levies collected under the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). there proposals are pragmatic and move in the right direction, but do not go far enough. the debate about own resources should focus on whether the eu will be able to build genuine own resources based on common tax policies. the eu suffers from \' tax leakage \' in which profits are shifted from high tax to low tax eu countries, and from there onto no or low tax non eu jurisdictions, often without the application of withholding taxes. it may not be too much ofa stretch to compare this situation of tax leakage with the situation addressed by cbam-a quasi tax at the border. so far, an opportunity for what could be seen as a tax at the border of the internal market, aiming to protect the market from harmful competition, may have been missed. such a tax could reflect the undertaxed profit rule agreed as part of the

where other options for finding a common solution have been exhausted. the primary tools against a risk of carbon leakage are current measures in eu emissions trading scheme (eu ets), like free allocation and indirect compensation, and they should be in place also in future. finnish businesses support the climate neutrality target of 2050 for the eu, and we see, that the eu ets is an effective tool to reduce ghg emissions in energy production and industry and it must remain as a main instrument to these sectors. carbon pricing continues to grow globally as a cost efficient tool for emissions reductions. currently around 20 % of global emissions are under a carbon price mechanism. but when comparing the measures among industry in different countries, progress is very slow among europe ' s main trading partners. the eu must ensure the global competitiveness of european companies and a level playing field in key export markets. it is good, that commission studies

company that aims to address this issue. founded by carlos monreal more than a decade ago, the company has been developing its unique tac process for plastic waste. our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company has projects in europe, asia, and the us. with three plants currently under construction in europe, plastic energy aims to recycle 5 million tonnes of plastic waste by

the tools to meet regulations, enhance transparency, and avoid risks. the eu deforestation regulation (eudr) is transforming global trade by ensuring that commodities like coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber are sourced without contributing to deforestation. businesses must now demonstrate compliance through traceability, due diligence, and risk assessments to maintain access to the eu market. eudr is not just a legal requirement. it marks a fundamental shift toward sustainable supply chains. companies that fail to comply face penalties, reputational risks, and potential market

engagement with suppliers. this workshop provides practical strategies, industry case studies, and best practices to help businesses navigate eudr requirements, mitigate risks, and implement effective sustainability measures. companies importing key commodities into the eu must establish robust traceability and due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the eu deforestation regulation (eudr). this is a crucial phase in preparing for full enforcement, where non compliance may lead to penalties and restricted market access. businesses will be required to provide geolocation data, risk assessments, and deforestation free verification for affected products such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber. early investment in supply chain transparency, digital tracking tools, and

the levies can be significant. for example, spain imported 14. 5 million tons of steel in 2022, half of which came from outside the eu. assuming an average carbon intensity of steel and the current eu carbon price, spanish steel importers could face annual tariffs of some 1 billion euros when cbam regulations are fully enforced in 2034. while the levies will initially apply only to a relatively

disparities in carbon pricing across regions posed challenges, including carbon leakagewhere companies relocate production to jurisdictions with less stringent climate policies. the european union spearheaded cbam ' s development as a solution to these challenges. initially proposed as part of the european green deal, cbam targeted key carbon intensive sectors like steel, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, hydrogen, and electricity. by attaching a carbon price equal to european emission allowances to imports from non eu countries, the mechanism sought to equalize the cost of carbon emissions between domestic producers and foreign competitors. cbam today current implementation status the eu began cbam ' s implementation in october 2023 with a transitional phase focused on reporting obligations. importers of covered goods must now provide data on embedded emissions, paving the way for full financial implementation in 2026. at first, only 2. 5 % of imported emissions will have to be covered with the cbam certificates but the percentage will gradually increase and reach 100 % by 2034. starting january 2025, the following updates to cbam regulations will take effect : mandatory use of eu emission calculation methodology : importers will be required to calculate embedded emissions using the eu ' s standardized methodology, replacing the flexibility of prior methods. this ensures greater consistency and accuracy across reported data. enhanced cbam registry features : the cbam registry will introduce a feature allowing non eu installation operators to upload emissions data directly for importers, streamlining compliance and data verification processes. authorized cb"", 'reference': '1122', 'full_answer': 'however, disparities in carbon pricing

and environmental standards worldwide. in this article, we show you what requirements the act places on your company and how new potential for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future can be tapped. since january 2023, all companies in germany with more than 3, employees have been obliged to comply with human rights and environmental standards throughout their entire supply chain. this means continuous monitoring of suppliers-all over the world, if in doubt. if a company recognises violations, it is now legally obliged to take measures to remedy the shortcomings. to ensure this continuous monitoring, companies must regularly report on their efforts to comply with human rights and environmental standards in their supply chains. these reports must be published. this ensures that an independent and, in case of doubt, public review can take place at any time. the implementation of the law is also monitored by the federal office of economics and export control. any infringements may result in fines and penalties. with these comprehensive monitoring options, the legislator wants to ensure that no companies can offer services or products in germany whose supply chain does not comply with minimum international human rights and environmental standards. supply chains have a significant impact on fair trade and the environment worldwide. therefore, a sustainable approach to supply chains is a decisive contribution to improving standards worldwide. treating suppliers fairly and paying fair prices for goods and services not only helps to improve working conditions in the producing countries, but also reduces the company ' s environmental footprint. in this way, fair business practices help to actively improve people ' s standard of living and implement more sustainable production on the global market. supply chains always function according to certain operating principles. if only profit is taken into account, there is a risk of exploitation, forced labor, child labor and inappropriate working conditions. monitoring supply chains, on the other hand, helps to improve working conditions worldwide. of course, the implementation

"" what is being simplified ? the omnibus package focuses on four key areas of sustainability regulation : 1. csrd (corporate sustainability reporting directive) requires large companies to report on environmental, social, and governance (esg) performance using standardized metrics (esrs). 2. csddd (corporate sustainability due diligence directive) mandates large firms to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights and environmental risks in their supply chains. 3. eu taxonomy regulation provides a classification system for sustainable economic activities, guiding companies and investors through disclosure requirements. 4. cbam (carbon border adjustment mechanism) imposes a carbon price on certain imports to prevent carbon leakage and ensure fair competition for eu producers. key changes introduced by the omnibus package 1. higher thresholds, fewer companies covered the threshold for csrd and eu taxonomy reporting has been raised from 250 to 1, employees, aligning with the csddd scope. this change excludes about 80 % of the companies that would have been subject to mandatory sustainability reporting, reducing the number from ~ 50, to ~ 10 ,. as a result, many medium sized and listed smes are no longer required to submit detailed esg disclosures. 2. simplified sustainability reporting (csrd) companies still subject to csrd will benefit from significantly streamlined esrs standards. the number of required data points is being reduced by around 70 %, with clearer instructions to reduce confusion and reporting fatigue. plans for industry specific standards have been scrapped. the assurance requirement will remain "" limited, "" avoiding more costly and intensive audits. a two year delay has been granted for many companies that were due to

' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and

not need to make. without an adaption of the competition policy framework, eu industrial competitiveness is at risk. cefic supports the overall direction taken by the green deal and the eu going climate neutral by 2050. the required industrial transformation will imply massive investments : a dechema analysis shows an investment requirement of 27bn per year between now and 2050. this will only be possible if private investment is enabled (amongst other things, by ensuring globally competitive conditions for industry in europe), and by ensuring sufficient public sector support is available. eu competition policy should be aligned with the green deal objectives and enable this massive transformation. it needs to balance newly market conditions as well as maintaining competition

parts of the strategy, which span a large number of issues. the reason why the latest industrial strategy, dated march 2020, is already being updated is, of course, the result of covid 19. the day after the publication of the strategy, this was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization. the pandemic has had a major impact on both the economy and on business within the eu, in both the short and long term. in the short term, the crisis has led to job losses and financial problems for many businesses, particularly in a number of vulnerable sectors. this has led to extensive government support measures in order to save companies in crisis. however, it has also highlighted weaknesses in the eu ' s single market and in international trade, with unforeseen barriers and broken value chains, with a shortage of goods and closing entire industries. the pandemic will also have many long term effects ; structural transformation in the form of digitisation and conversion to more sustainable production is likely to be accelerated. the single market will be strengthened, and trade will be opened up and diversified to reduce vulnerability to the next crisis one which no one can predict ; how it will look or how it will manifest itself. the pandemic is not the only thing creating pressure for new proposals in the updated industrial strategy. at the center of this are the discussions on how the eu can best assert itself globally when it comes to being at the forefront of economic and technological development. not least, it is about ensuring that the competitiveness of eu business is properly promoted when public funds are invested in selected research projects for the technologies of the future, and that companies can work jointly to develop the best solutions. in addition, it must be about the public sector setting out properly functioning rules, allowing companies to then compete to develop the best solutions on a level playing field. we

adjustment mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible

that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon
