steel industry is fundamental for european economy, providing critical inputs to many sectors, including automotive, construction, and defence. around five hundred production sites across 22 member states contribute about eur 80 billion in gdpand underpin over 2. 5 million jobs. steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio economic and political importance. however, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu. building on the clean transition dialogueon steel in march 2024 and follow up input, which helped form a

for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive

today ' s discussion, i would like to share some observations. first of all, let me inform you that i have asked my five colleagues, senior officials of the commission whom you know well, to join this discussion. we also have gathered today the representatives of the key strategic energy intensive sectors, including metals, fertilisers, ceramic, cement, refineries, chemicals, glass, lime, waste, pulp and paper, as well as producers of clean energy and alternative energy carriers, off takers and financial institutions. let me start by saying thatenergy intensive industries are a pillar of the eu ' s economy. you play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value. and i know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the covid 19 pandemic and then russia ' s war against ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. to mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on european businesses, the commission put in place a number of measures, including : the energy situation has now somewhat stabilised ; however today ' sgas prices are still twice as high compared to pre crisis levels. so i know the impact they have on your businesses is still very significant. and, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future. there is no silver bullet to lower them. rather, we need to double down on our overall aims. that meansaccelerating the green transition : we mustscale up renewables roll out,

trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu ' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030,

these votes represent the final step in the process of finalising these three interlinked pillars of the green deal. while the eu is reducing emissions from its own industries, emissions associated with goods imported into the eu have increased in recent years. with the introduction of the cbam, the eu has finally agreed to end ' free pollution permits ' as importers pay a pollution price, eu

zero by 2040. in return, industries that modernise and transform will get more support through the increased innovation fund and modernisation fund. the prospect of this change has already led to a

the final step is the approval of the european parliament and the council of the negotiation result. michael bloss, greens / efa shadow rapporteur on the ets in the lead environment committee, comments : we will end the free pollution party. it is now clear that industry that pollutes will pay, industry that modernizes will stay. we have achieved a strong signal to industry to reduce emissions. oil and gas will finally pay a fair price. the agreement slashes the distribution of free co2 certificates by half by 2030, and puts a complete stop to free allowances by 2034. instead industry that modernizes and transforms will get support. in this way we secure good clean industrial jobs and production to be located in europe in the future. greens / efa succeeded to fight back all attempts to weaken climate ambition, but what has been achieved is not enough to fulfill the paris agreement. renewable energies will have priority in the future. now investing in renewable energies will pay off more than sinking millions into oil and gas. today ' s agreement is a good first step towards the energy and climate transition and towards a green industry. we as greens / efa

seen unprecedented droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires, and we have all been shocked by the devastating flooding in pakistan. here in japan, the sheer force of super typhoon nanmadol and the tragic loss of life it caused were very alarming. it is as if every day, mother nature is reminding us that the window for action is closing very rapidly. we urgently need to go beyond setting commitments, to deliver steep emissions reductions in the next few years. i am very pleased that the european union and japan are strong partners in this endeavour. the eu ' s own green transformation is well underway. following russia ' s unjustified invasion of ukraine, we are moving away from fossil fuels even quicker than before. to be more secure in our energy supply, we are saving energy and speeding up the transition to renewables. in parallel, we are continuing our work to reduce emissions by at least 55 % this decade. our so called fit for 55 package strengthens climate and energy policy in nearly all economic sectors : from road transport and aviation to industry and the land sector. thanks to our emissions trading system, the eu has already cut 25 % of emissions as compared to 1990. this cap and trade system has a proven track record for energy generation and heavy industry, and now we are strengthening the system to reduce emissions even faster. we will also introduce emissions trading for maritime, buildings, and road transport. to avoid that our carbon emissions are pushed into other places – the so called carbon leakage, we are also establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). this will put a price on the carbon content of imported products made with high carbon emissions, such as steel and cement. these are just a few examples of how we are using regulation to steer europe ' s transition to net zero. in japan, you are heading to the same destination, but with a different path. i am therefore eager and curious to see how the planned green

thatenergy intensive industries are a pillar of the eu ' s economy. you play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value. and i know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the covid 19 pandemic and then russia ' s war against ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. to mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on european businesses, the commission put in place a number of measures, including : the energy situation has now somewhat stabilised ; however today ' sgas prices are still twice as high compared to pre crisis levels. so i know the impact they have on your businesses is still very significant. and, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future. there is no silver bullet to lower them. rather, we need to double down on our overall aims. that meansaccelerating the green

gentlemen, distinguished guests, honourable members, it is a great pleasure to speak at this second edition of the tax symposium. i am very happy to see such a large attendance here in this hemicycle and online. this shows there is a strong and growing interest in eu tax policy. our citizens see taxation as one of the areas where the eu dimension needs to be further developed and strengthened to tackle the challenges of our time. this emerged clearly from the conference on the future of europe. and it is something to which both the commission and the european parliament attach the highest political importance. which is why the choice of hosting this symposium together, here, in the house of european democracy, is no coincidence. before i turn to what i see as the priorities for the future of taxation, let me recall where we have come from. [ achievements ] we are entering the final stretch of a mandate that has been nothing short of extraordinary, given the succession of crises we have faced. and equally unprecedented was our response. with our common approach on vaccines. with common borrowing to relaunch our economies in an unprecedented show of solidarity under next generation eu and the recovery and resilience facility (rrf). with our green strategy, supported by innovative measures like the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). with common initiatives to address the energy crisis. with our unity in supporting ukraine. taxation has been a centrepiece of our response. we adopted vat waivers for vaccines. we committed to find new own resources to finance the rrf and have already put on the table the emissions trading system, cbam and a corporate profit based statistical contribution, pending the adoption of befit, our proposed new framework for business taxation. we provided guidance to member states on energy taxation measures. and we took other measures beyond taxation, like the solidarity contribution on the windfall profits of oil companies. even as we have tackled these crises, we have driven forward an ambitious agenda for tax reform – in the eu and beyond. the international tax agreement was the landmark achievement of the past few years. this agreement represents an opportunity to put an end to the race to the bottom in corporate taxation. this was unthinkable just a few years ago. and it would not have been possible without the eu ' s tireless efforts. europe is leading the way in making this agreement a reality. the 15 % global minimum tax rate will generate some usd 220 billion more in global tax revenues per year ,"", 'reference': '31', 'full_answer': 'with common

discussion we had today was on increasing defence spending at eu and national levels. as you know, following up on our re arm europe plan and the recent special european council, the commission is working intensively on a set of proposals to be presented shortly. amongst others, the commission will soon propose the coordinated activation of the national escape clause. today ' s meeting was a good opportunity to gather first feedback from eu member states on this initiative. there was a broad support for a coordinated activation of the national escape clause. many member states emphasised that activation should be targeted and temporary. it should allow member states to transition to a structurally higher level of defence expenditure, while having fiscal sustainability considerations in mind. on the definition of defence spending, there appears to be several advantages for using the already established definition of defence expenditure, or the so called broad cofog definition. this provides for a scope broadly in line with the nato definition of defence spending, and will allow us to move fast, using a concept that has a solid statistical basis. we also took note of requests by several member states to take into consideration the specificities of those member states that already have high defence spending. this discussion was very useful, as we will be able to take this into account before tabling the commission ' s proposal, possibly already next week. we also held our regular exchange on developments related to russia ' s full scale aggression against ukraine. the eu will continue to provide ukraine with regular and predictable financial support. this year, the eu is already mobilised to provide € 30. 6 billion in financing to ukraine. the commission stands ready to frontload financing under these instruments if that would be required by ukraine ' s financing needs. in total, € 135 billion in assistance has been provided by the eu to ukraine. that is more than any other of its international partners. today, we also heard a strong support from ministers for strengthening the enforcement of sanctions and avoiding their circumvention, in particular via sharing information amongst member states. for example, better coordination of data exchange and the use of ai could be of great use for our custom authorities.

recall the beginnings of cbam. our generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth : pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change. these crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50 % below normal in august and september. it impacted agriculture, energy production, and more. in europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world. we are observing these impacts not only in china and in the european union, but literally facing them all

what is the euemissions trading system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise

extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such"", 'reference': '35', 'full_answer': 'the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes.', 'sentence_beginning': ' the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7626928091049194}, {'answer': 'today adjusted and complemented its proposal', 'confidence': np.float32(0.03243749), 'start': np.int64(226), 'end': np.int64(231), 'context': ""how does the own resources system work today ?

emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon

december), the negotiators of the european parliament, the council and the european commission reached an agreement on the revision of the european carbon market (ets) and the creation of a new eu social climate fund. the agreement sends a clear signal to industry to reduce emissions, but member states must urgently ramp up support for vulnerable households. emissions trading as a climate policy instrument is a central building block of the green deal and the fit for 55 package to achieve the eu ' s climate goal of reducing eu net emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and making the eu the first climate neutral continent by 2050. the final step is the approval of the european parliament and the council of the negotiation result. michael bloss, greens / efa shadow rapporteur on the ets in the lead environment committee, comments : we will end the free pollution party. it is now clear that industry that pollutes will pay, industry that modernizes will stay. we have achieved a strong signal to industry to reduce emissions. oil and gas will finally pay a fair price. the agreement slashes the distribution of free co2 certificates by half by 2030, and puts a complete stop to free allowances by 2034. instead industry that modernizes and transforms will get support. in this way we secure good clean industrial jobs and production to be located in europe in the future. greens

emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon

change and achieve our green deal objectives, we have to put a price tag on carbon emissions while avoiding carbon leakage. the revised eu emission trading system state aid guidelines adopted today are an important element of this project. they enable member states to support those sectors that, because of indirect emission costs, are most at risk of carbon leakage. at the same time, they help deliver on a cost effective decarbonisation of the economy by avoiding overcompensation and undue distortions of competitionin the single market ”. eu state aid control has an important role to play in enabling europe to fulfil its green deal objectives. in order to reap the full benefits of limited public funds, it is crucial that state aid rules continue to do their part. this means ensuring that public money does not crowd out private spending and maintaining a level playing field in the single market, while minimising costs for taxpayers. the ets guidelines aim at reducing the risk of “ carbon leakage ”, where companies move production to countries outside the eu with less ambitious climate policies, leading to less economic activity in the eu and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions globally. in particular, they enable member states to compensate companies in at risk sectors for part of the higher electricity prices resulting from the carbon price signals created by the eu ets (so called “ indirect emission costs ”). at the same time, overcompensation of companies would risk running counter to the price signals created by the eu ets to promote a cost effective decarbonisation of the economy and create undue distortions of competition in the single market. against this background, the revised ets guidelines will : the guidelines also take into account the specificities of small and medium sized enterprises (smes), in line with the sme strategy for a sustainable and digital europe, by exempting them from the new conditionality requirement in order to limit their administrative burden. the commission has"", 'reference': '8', 'full_answer': 'the ets guidelines aim at reducing the risk of “ carbon leakage ”, where companies move production to

devoted to the pieces of legislation in the so called fit for 55 package, which aim to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. in its tabling of amendments,

european climate law makes the eu ’ s climate neutrality target legally binding and raises the union 2030 climate ambition by setting a target of at least 55 per cent net emission reductions by 2030 compared to 1990. the emissions trading system (ets) revision proposal, that strengthens and boosts the contribution of the ets, is the cornerstone of the ‘ fit for 2030 ’ legislative package, which amends the existing climate and energy legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or for adding to the scope small ships

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at

principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new

% reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such

result of our failure to balance our relationship with our natural environment. the costs of non action are increasing by the day : freak storms, erratic weather patterns, floods, wildfires, and the astonishing and swift loss of species on which we are reliant for the crops that feed us. and unfortunately, there is a strong nexus between these crises and security as we will face conflicts over water and arable lands in certain parts of the world. and yes, i am a grandfather and the risk of our grandchildren going to war over water and food is something we really need to avoid in advance. the european green deal is our answer. a modern growth strategy, encompassing everything from our mobility, our built environment, our energy production and consumption, our agriculture, our international trade and our taxonomy. we pledged to become climate neutral by 2050. and in december 2020 european leaders committed to a new 2030 target of at least 55 % emissions reductions compared to 1990. in the near term, approximately 800 billion of recovery and resilience facility (rrf) is europe ' s medium term answer to the covid 19 crisis and the centrepiece of the “ next generation eu

highlighted the importance of ambition on emission reductions at cop28 via the outcome of the global stocktake. in particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030, to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels. they discussed at length what the end of coal and other fossil fuels means for industrial restructuring and how to make these efforts compatible with energy security concerns. on the issue of climate finance, the commissioner underlined that all

the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented

current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to the eu ' s climate target. to reach this target, the commission proposes a steeper annual emissions reduction of 4. 2 % ("", 'reference': '29',

the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california,

of the report ‘ a wto compatible eu carbon border adjustment mechanism ’ provides the commission with important guidance in the eu ' s work towards our objective to make europe climate neutral by 2050 at the latest. the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is an important mechanism, which, in the framework of the european green deal, will stimulate industry to invest in green solutions and will prevent unfair competition from outside the eu. s & d shadow rapporteur, mohammed chahim mep, stated : we need a level playing field. if you want your products to enter the european market, you need to embrace our climate standards. this is the very first goal of this carbon border adjustment mechanism : decreasing global co2 emissions. as social democrats we demand transparent and predictable conditions, so that industry – in and outside the eu – can adjust and get ready. therefore we need a gradual, yet rapid, phase out of the free allowances within the emission trading system (ets), once the cbam is introduced. we count on the commission to bring clarity on this matter. we will be working hard in the coming year to pass all the climate legislation from the ‘ fit for 55 package ’ to reduce emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, including the legislative proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism. the message is clear : we want the commission to come up with an ambitious proposal that sets the eu on the right side of history when it comes to fighting climate change. s & d co ordinator in the environment committee, jytte guteland mep, said : the eu is the world ' s largest carbon importer, with net imports of goods and services in the eu representing more than a fifth of the union ’ s domestic co2 emissions. obviously, this hampers our fight against climate change and undermines the important measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism can be the missing piece of the puzzle in the efforts to reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far from being a hidden tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions, the cbam can turn out to be a great asset, both for the climate and as a strong economic incentive to develop production methods with a lower greenhouse gas footprint, and can spur investments in innovation and new technologies."", 'reference': '92', 'full_answer': 'therefore we need a

should be clear that this is not supposed to be a plan economy. what we need is to offer all industries a consistent public policy across different policy instruments that will support them through these complex transitions. we need to get these strategies in place as soon as possible. if we would have the strategies now, we could adjust the spending and legislative priorities for 2022. that would leave us about 8. 5 years for a monumental transformation. that is an extremely short timeline, which can only be achieved with concerted and dedicated efforts from both policymakers and

doing this, we leave no one behind. our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy. i have to admit with all the admiration i have for what parliament has done so far, some of your positions do worry me. first, emissions trading for fuels and road transport and buildings. this is an incredibly important extra tool to tackle emissions and buildings and transport. in transport, emissions are not just rising gradually. they ' re shooting up instead of going down. in buildings, we need to double our effort to reduce consumption"", 'reference': '45', 'full_answer': ""money

adjustment mechanism ? the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such measures could support"", 'reference': '35', 'full_answer': ""as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon
