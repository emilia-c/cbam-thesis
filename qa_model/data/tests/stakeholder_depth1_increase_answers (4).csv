that domestic decarbonization policies could result in lost competitive advantage visavis nations with weaker environmental policies. to address such competitiveness concerns, decisionmakers have proposed policies to couple domestic industrial decarbonization efforts with trade policies and thereby address three goals : a) maintain domestic competitiveness against imports produced in countries with relatively weaker environmental policies, b) maintain competitiveness in export markets, and c) provide incentives for trading partners to improve their environmental performances. a prominent example of such a trade policy is a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) that applies a fee to imported goods. a proposed cbam is under active discussion in the european union, and cbam legislation is in the early stages of development within the us congress. traditionally, trade policies to address competitiveness concerns have been proposed as a layer on top of a country \' s

policy that natively and explicitly addresses competitiveness concerns. this issue brief outlines such an alternative approach. this policy would define a performance metric for a selected set of industrial sectors and apply a fee based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) content of produced goods in those sectors, but only to the extent the goods \' ghg content exceeds the metric. the fee would be applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced goods, maintaining a level playing field. overall, this policy approach inherently addresses competitiveness concerns and creates incentives

consecutive year of downturn 2024 has been a year of economic contraction for europe ' s technology industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labour costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or considering closing plants. these closures would have knockon effects on technology industries that supply components to the automotive sector. conclusion orgalim ' s autumn 2024 economics & statistics report presents a sobering view of the challenges facing europe ' s technology industries. the combination of weak demand, burdensome overregulation, high energy prices and structural labour issues continues to hinder growth. without decisive"", 'reference': '1050',

introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought within the scope of the mechanism should be granted a sufficiently long transition period now and in the future."",

starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the
