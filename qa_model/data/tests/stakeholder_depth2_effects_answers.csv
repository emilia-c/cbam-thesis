for 55 \' package is a crucial step towards the eu climate neutrality objective by 2050. a successful implementation will require ambition across the economy, including an ambitious industrial policy creating the enabling framework for the transformation of europe \' s industrial base. policies also need to be backed up with a sectorial strategy providing more details on how the commission expects different sectors of the whole economy (industry, power, buildings, transport, agriculture) to contribute to the overall objectives until 2030 and beyond. this sectorial strategy should also include regular check points regarding progress on the enabling conditions for the transition of each sector. for the chemical industry, this includes the availability of competitively priced renewable and low carbon energy, support for the deployment of breakthrough technologies, availability of public and private finance and robust carbon leakage protection. we therefore want to ensure that the fit

transport transition ' without a real ambitious rail strategy 9 december, the european transport ministers convened to take stock of the ongoing council of the european union discussions concerning the fit for 55 package proposals. in this context, unife wishes to reiterate how important rail ' s role is in achieving the eu ' s transport decarbonization objectives set by the european climate law. unife welcomes the inclusion of rail in the scope of the new commission proposal for a regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (afir). however, rail related provisions are not as ambitious as those related to other modes of transport. our sector is not properly considered in the latest discussions about the afir proposal being held at the council level. rail is by far the greenest mode of mass transportation as it accounts for less than 0. 5 % of transport related greenhouse gas emissions and is the only mode to both steadily improve its energy efficiency while increasing capacities. however, as of today only 54 % of the current european rail network is electrified. as these lines convey 80 % of traffic, there remain a significant number of diesel trains / locomotives in service. considering that the life cycles of rail industry assets are long for example, several decades for rail rolling stock-, urgent decarbonization measures need to be put in place now to support deployment of alternative fuels infrastructures for rail, especially for those lines that are not mandated to be electrified under the trans european network transport (ten t). our association also strongly supports the provision of optional tax exemption for energy products and electricity used for goods and passenger transport by rail, metro, tram and trolley bus, called for in the energy taxation directive (etd) recast. this option would further encourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport, like rail. unife expects other instruments, such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) and the eu emissions trading system (ets) reform, to curb emissions while providing additional revenue to be invested in innovation and low carbon rail infrastructure that would further decrease the sector carbon footprint. our members urgently call on european member states to carefully reconsider the following elements when continuing discussions on the fit for 55 proposals under the french presidency of the council, coming to office in january 2022 : there will be no decarbonization transition of the european transport sector without rail.

'context': ""circular supply chain : creating sustainable and efficient operations imagine your company making profits and contributing to a better environment. the circular supply chain makes this possible by radically changing how we produce and use products. it is a system where waste is a thing of the past and resources are utilized optimally. from reuse to recycling, this model offers enormous benefits for both the environment and business results. let ' s see how this works. what is a circular supply chain ? in a circular supply chain, products, components, and materials are continuously reused in a closed loop approach. think of a company that takes back used products, refurbishes them, and resells them instead of discarding them. this extends the product ' s lifespan, reduces the need for new raw materials, and minimizes environmental impact. an example is philips, which takes back old medical equipment, refurbishes it, and reintroduces it to the market circular vs. closed loop supply chain although ' circular ' and ' closed loop ' are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference. a closed loop supply chain focuses on recycling materials within the chain to minimize waste. circular goes further and encompasses the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to end of life. imagine a thrift store versus a product designer who considers reuse and recycling from the start. linear supply chain the opposite of a circular supply chain is a linear supply chain. the raw materials are sourced, produced, used, and discarded. while most companies currently operate their supply chain as a linear flow of goods, recycling companies and second hand dealers and shops take their linear products and try to reuse them. it is crucial to learn that having a linear organization does not mean that your product is also used linearly. creating a circular supply chain creating it requires a holistic approach that involves all stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. the process involves four key steps : design for sustainability : the first step is to design products with sustainability in mind, considering the entire product lifecycle and its environmental impact. optimize resource utilization : the next step is to optimize resource utilization by reducing waste and maximizing renewable sources. implement reverse logistics : the third step is reverse logistics, where products are collected and returned to the supply chain for refurbishment, remanufacturing, or recycling. foster collaboration

with human rights and environmental standards throughout their entire supply chain. this means continuous monitoring of suppliers-all over the world, if in doubt. if a company recognises violations, it is now legally obliged to take measures to remedy the shortcomings. to ensure this continuous monitoring, companies must regularly report on their efforts to comply with human rights and environmental standards in their supply chains. these reports must be published. this ensures that an independent and, in case of doubt, public review can take place at any time. the implementation of the law is also monitored by the federal office of economics and export control. any infringements may result in fines and penalties. with these comprehensive monitoring options, the legislator wants to ensure that no companies can offer services or products in germany whose supply chain does not comply with minimum international human rights and environmental standards. supply chains have a significant impact on fair trade and the environment worldwide. therefore, a sustainable approach to supply chains is a decisive contribution to improving standards worldwide. treating suppliers

from waste to renewal wind energy plays a vital role in the transition to a low carbon future, supported by global treaties like the paris agreement. however, the life cycle of wind turbines presents a significant sustainability challenge : their blades, made from complex composite materials, are difficult to recycle and often end up in landfills. with over 40 million tonnes of waste expected by 2050, the industry must shift from a linear "" take make dispose "" model to a circular one that recycles and reuses materials throughout the turbine \' s life cycle. this issue is critical not just from an environmental standpoint but also from an economic perspective. current waste practices perpetuate reliance on finite resources such as petroleum and silica, which undermines the wind sector \' s long term sustainability. moreover, disruptions in supply chains due to political or environmental crises further emphasise the importance of reducing material dependency. the complexity of the value chain, involving multiple stakeholders from manufacturers to recyclers, complicates efforts to make the wind industry fully circular. collaborative approaches, material innovations, and policy interventions are essential to making wind energy regenerative. at bax, we leverage our extensive experience in renewable energy and circular economy strategies to collaborate with industry stakeholders in addressing the blade waste problem from multiple angles. our goal is to transform wind energy into a fully regenerative power source by embedding circularity into every stage of the

intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and

amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its

""cece calls for competitive steel market 19 may 2021 as europe begins to recover, reasonable pricing for steel is vital for the construction industry european construction equipment manufacturers,

safeguard measures to ensure a competitive steel market and favorable market conditions. the main reason for the price surge seems to be a supply demand imbalance in the european steel market. on the one hand demand for steel from the eu industry has risen as a consequence of the economic recovery. on the other hand, supply could not meet demand due to a reduction in domestic as well as imported steel production. whereas the reduction in domestic production has been intensified by the covid 19 outbreak, the reduction in imported steel is a consequences of certain eu trade measures, in particular the steel safeguard measures. steel safeguard measures safeguards are trade measures meant for situations in which an industry is affected by an unforeseen, sharp and sudden increase of imports causing (or threatening) serious injury to domestic industry. the eu steel safeguard measures were introduced as part of the european union ' s response to the 2018 decision by the united states to impose tariffs on steel products on national security grounds. until 2018, imports of steel products into the eu increased sharply against a background of a persistent overcapacity in the global steel market and unfair trade practices by certain trading partners. the eu investigation found that us tariffs on steel were causing a diversion of trade flows into the eu. for this reason, the eu has deemed it necessary to protect eu steelmakers against excessive imports with safeguard measures. the eu safeguard measures concern 26 steel product categories imported from a list of developing countries and take the form of tariff rate quotas (' trqs ') per country, above which a 25 % duty is levied on imports. the safeguard measures were imposed in july 2018 for a period until

the implementation of the european green deal during the 2024-2029 european union institutional cycle. to strike the right balance between these sometimes conflicting objectives, eu policymakers should focus on both domestic and international aspects of the green deal. domestically, they must ensure implementation of the agreed climate plan, avoiding inaction or delay. internationally, they must establish a new green diplomacy and partnerships strategy, which will support global decarbonization while addressing competitiveness and strategic autonomy concerns. the current eu approach to green diplomacy is uncoordinated, lacking a clear strategy and appropriate resources. given the eu ' s limited share of annual global emissions, supporting decarbonization abroad is fundamental to meet the global net zero emissions goal. the eu ' s green diplomacy and partnerships need to be strengthened and expanded in a pragmatic and coherent manner. the main priorities include focusing on the implementation of international emissions reduction pledges, a new diplomatic push for carbon pricing and international green taxation, the creation of streamlined partnerships for green industrialisation with major partner countries and the promotion of new global trade and climate agreements. to succeed in these, a revision of the current governance of eu global green action will be

prevent possible violations. the law is intended to help improve and harmonise compliance with human rights and environmental standards worldwide. in this article, we show you what requirements the act places on your company and how new potential for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future can be tapped. since january 2023, all companies in germany with more than 3, employees have been obliged to comply with human rights and environmental standards throughout their entire supply chain. this means continuous monitoring of suppliers-all over the world, if in doubt. if a company recognises violations, it is now legally obliged to take measures to remedy the shortcomings. to ensure this continuous monitoring, companies must regularly report on their efforts to comply with human rights and environmental standards in their supply chains. these reports must be published. this ensures that an independent and, in case of doubt, public review can take place at any time. the implementation of the law is also monitored by the federal office of economics and export control. any infringements may result in fines and penalties. with these comprehensive monitoring options, the legislator wants to ensure that no companies can offer services or products in germany whose supply chain does not comply with minimum international human rights and environmental standards. supply

discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its

journal of environmental law (2022) carbon border adjustment measures : a straightforward multi purpose climate change instrument ? alice pirlot * carbon border adjustment measures (cbams) are instruments that can be used to mitigate climate change, but also have a positive impact on trade, climate leadership and even public finance. in this article, i challenge the view that they can serve as straightforward multi purpose instruments. in a first step, i analyze each of the purposes that can be achieved through cbams and explain their underlying differences. ina second step, i discuss their legal design and explain how cbams \' design features affect the types of purposes that they can achieve. i apply this two step analytical framework to the european union context, where a proposal for a regulation establishing a cbam has been published by the european commission in july 2021. i demonstrate that the design of the eu cbam is inconsistent with the commission \' s main objectives of promoting fair competition and climate mitigation in line with the paris agreement. the eu cbam proposal is primarily an instrument of climate leadership. 1 introduction in the legal and policy discourse, multiple purposes have been attached to carbon border adjustment measures (cbams), including the prevention of carbon leakage, the promotion of compliance with the paris agreement, the development of climate leadership, the internalisation of emissions in the country of consumption, and the generation of revenue. \' whilst these different purposes might appear mutually supportive at first sight, i argue that they are not fully reconcilable. presenting them as such gives the wrong impression that cbams are a \' straightforward and uniform regulatory strategy \' to mitigate climate change. "" it also hides the difficult design choices that underlie the adoption of cbams and can compromise their effectiveness. * instead of being viewed as straightforward and uniform, | argue that the concept of cbam should be understood as an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of measures, which can each achieve different types of purposes depending on their specific legal design.',

picture : over 75 % of companies affected by cbam are actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers

framework, eu industrial competitiveness is at risk. cefic supports the overall direction taken by the green deal and the eu going climate neutral by 2050. the required industrial transformation will imply massive investments : a dechema analysis shows an investment requirement of 27bn per year between now and 2050. this will only be possible if private investment is enabled (amongst other things, by ensuring globally competitive conditions for industry in europe), and by ensuring sufficient public sector support is available. eu competition policy should be aligned with the green deal objectives and enable this massive transformation. it needs to balance newly market conditions as well as maintaining competition in the eu single market with the demands of industrial transformation in the pursuit of the environmental goals of the green deal. innovation wil be key for the success of the transformation. competition policy needs to aim at supporting innovation via competition and

electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth

how to ensure sufficient coherence between emission trading schemes like the eu ets and cbam ? how can the measures incentivise eu investments and secure european industry competitiveness ? join us to deep dive into a policy framework to decarbonise the european economy, while maintaining a well functioning trade system and securing investments in europe. peter liese member of the european parliament victor van hoorn executive director eurosif domien vangenechten policy adviser e3g els brouwers director energy, climate and economic affairs essenscia"", 'reference': '688', 'full_answer': ""it ' s clear that this transition is going to require massive investments, and the ongoing war in ukraine and its consequences may pose more challenges on the road."", 'sentence_beginning': "" it ' s clear that this transition is going to require massive investments, "", 'sentence_end': ' and its consequences may pose more challenges on the road.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'margins are thin and profitability cannot be taken for granted', 'confidence': np.float32(0.0010327683), 'start': np.int64(362), 'end': np.int64(372), 'context': 'the decade ahead must pave the way to make heavy industries climate neutral by 2050. we need a policy framework for 2030 that helps heavy industries to transform and that is not disruptive. this week, industri all europe and the etuc met paolo gentiloni, eu commissioner for economy, to share expectations and demands of trade unions for the upcoming proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). the meeting was organised by the commissioner in order to hear the views of stakeholders, ranging from industry associations, trade unions, as well as social and environmental ngos. the carbon border adjustment mechanism, together with the eu emissions trading system (ets), are instruments to support eu industry in its efforts to reach climate neutrality by 2050. the cbam would put a carbon price on imports of certain goods from outside the eu to prevent companies from transferring their production to countries with lower environmental standards and higher emissions (the so called \' carbon leakage \'). industri all europe is in favor of climate policy instruments that create the conditions to invest in the technologies and infrastructures necessary to reduce emissions. luc triangle, general secretary of industri all europe, said : "" the decade ahead must pave the way to make heavy industries climate neutral by 2050. we need a policy framework for 2030 that helps heavy industries to transform and that is not disruptive. we need a revised ets, driving investment towards clean technologies, and a policy framework-including a carbon adjustment mechanism-that mitigates the risk of carbon leakage.

the european union emissions trading system (eu ets) is a cornerstone of the eu ' s efforts to combat climate change. launched in 2005, it is the world ' s first and largest carbon market in terms of trading volume and value. the eu ets covers various sectors, including power generation, heavy industry and aviation within the european economic area (eea). it will soon be extended to maritime transport, while a parallel scheme will be established for fuels consumed by buildings and road vehicles. the eu ets works by obliging all companies under its scope to surrender ' allowances ', i. e. pollution permits, for their greenhouse gas emissions. one allowance provides the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets. since companies can trade allowances freely with each other, their price is determined by supply and demand. for the first time, in 2023 the eu ets allowance price exceeded 100. how are eu ets allowances allocated ? there are two ways to obtain allowances under the eu ets. the main way is to buy them, either at auction (primary market) or from other companies (secondary market). auctions take place daily at the european energy exchange (eex). allowances can be traded on the secondary market at any time, either directly between buyers and sellers, or indirectly through intermediaries. an alternative way to obtain allowances is to receive them from the authorities for free. during the first compliance years of the eu ets, almost all allowances were distributed to companies for free. since 2008, the percentage of freely allocated allowances has been progressively decreasing. the share of free allowances decreased from 80 % in 2013 to 30 % in 2020 (eu ets directive, article 10a (11)). for the coming years, free allocation of allowance"", 'reference': '81', 'full_answer': 'failure to do so leads to heavy fines.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'the pandemic', 'confidence': np.float32(0.00026130228), 'start': np.int64(144), 'end': np.int64(146), 'context': ""madame president, honourable members, i am really honoured and happy to be here, honourable members. it is also wonderful to be here in person, even with these restrictions. to see you present here, because it is a first sign that we are slowly recovering from the pandemic and slowly going back to business as usual. and i have to say, i would have never thought a year ago that i would be craving for what bruce springsteen calls ' a human touch ', but we really are in need of meeting each other again and discussing many things. the challenges we face are daunting-in the next months and years we will have to confront the real cost of the pandemic, both when it comes to our economy as well as restoring fairness and equality in our societies. one issue i would explicitly want to mention is what this has done to woman and girls across the european union. very often frontline workers, but also, sadly again, increased victims of gender based violence. this has put society on edge. the most vulnerable in society have paid the highest price. women, girls, but also minorities across the european union, and people in vulnerable social and economic situations. given the role of this institution, i think it is important that we discuss those things you represent all voices in society-businesses, workers, civil society. and we need to discuss it with you. we need to zoom in on a topic that is very close to my heart : how to make the european green deal a just and social deal. very simple, the european green deal is going to be just, or there is just not going to be a european green deal. the need to take climate action i would like to start by thanking you and this institution for the support for our increased climate ambitions for 2030. i think it is quite an achievement. the european economic and social committee is, as i said, a microcosm of wider european society. if the debate here is along those lines, i am sure it reflects the situation in our society. also with different interests, taking different positions and then coming to joint conclusions. that is the strength of the european social model. so what you show here is, even with these different interests, all those voices can point to the same direction : the urgent need to act against the twin crises of the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis. we at the commission share this feeling of urgency. despite the covid crisis, the call from citizens to take action against these twin"", 'reference': '1950', 'full_answer': 'to see you present here, because it is a first sign that we are slowly recovering from the pandemic and slowly going back to business as usual.', 'sentence_beginning': ' to see you present here, because it is a first sign that we are slowly recovering from ', 'sentence_end': ' and slowly going back to business as usual.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'and changes to the eu generation mix', 'confidence': np.float32(0.00022400192), 'start': np.int64(125), 'end': np.int64(130), 'context': ""agenda 2025 18. 00-20. 00 welcome drinks reception 08 : 00-08 : 50 registrations and welcome refreshments 08 : 50-08 : 55 conference welcome devina singh conference producer argus 08 : 55-09. 00 chairperson ' s opening remarks 09 : 00-09 : 30 opening keynote by the french government speakers include : alain sauvant inspector general french ministry of the environment-igedd 09. 30-10. 00 argus overview on carbon pricing driving the demand in the market and global significance of the carbon framework-how did industrial slowdown and changes to the eu generation mix influence the market ?-how did structural changes to supply and demand affect prices ?-how are these factors shaping up to develop this year and beyond ?-how did eu and uk ets prices develop in 2024 ?

and the transition to net zero is no exception. decarbonising our economy is a huge task : done well, it offers businesses the opportunity to future proof operations, save on energy costs, and play a crucial role in the frontline battle to lower emissions. the urgent need to tackle climate change presents a significant business opportunity for organizations of all shapes and sizes. investing in the clean energy transition and achieving the uk ' s net zero ambition is a significant path for economic growth for the uk, with our gross domestic product (gdp) set to be 6. 4 % higher in 2050 if we pursue an accelerated transition. harnessing the benefits of the green industrial revolution will ensure the uk remains globally competitive and ensure we are well placed to lead internationally in low carbon products and services. it will also make businesses more resilient, shielding them from volatile fossil fuel prices. coal from british collieries once was the uk ' s dominant energy source, but clean homegrown energy from technologies such as wind and solar will power the low carbon industries of the future. realising these benefits rests on the ability of the energy and business sectors to work together to accelerate the transition. the uk has an abundant resource of clean electricity that can help reduce energy bills and make products manufactured here some of the lowest carbon goods in the world. much of the investment needed to achieve this will be delivered by the private sector ; investment that is dependent on well designed policy frameworks. this new report from public

held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in

strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide.

alone contribute 18 % of india ' s total emissions. with the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) legislation, there is increasing focus on decarbonising industrial energy use. understanding the ' hard to abate ' nature of industries and exploring available options is crucial for initiating decarbonization. in the near term (to 2030), transitioning from fossil fuel based electricity to renewable energy sources (res) is crucial to meet current power needs sustainably. in the long term (to 2050), industries must adopt advanced electrification and power to fuel technologies to rapidly decarbonise their emission intensive operations. green electrification will significantly change energy consumption patterns in these industries, requiring strategic planning to ensure future energy demands are met efficiently. key takeaways renewable energy can decarbonise up to 11 % of india ' s heavy industries ' current energy consumption industries rely on fossil fuel and electricity for their heat and power requirements, respectively. in 2022, india ' s heavy industriessteel, cement, aluminium, petrochemicals and ammoniaconsumed a total of 175 twh of electricity, making up 11 % of their overall energy consumption. notably, 91 % of this electricity was used by the steel, cement, and aluminium sectors. sourcing this electricity from res can significantly reduce industrial emissions and ensure compliance with international norms like the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). india ' s heavy industries require 120 gw of renewables by 2030 to fully decarbonise their electricity demand by 2030, electricity demand in india ' s heavy industries is expected to rise by 45 % to reach 253 twh, driven by existing technologies and projected growth rates.

heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them

here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic

that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum

day after the publication of the strategy, this was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization. the pandemic has had a major impact on both the economy and on business within the eu, in both the short and long term. in the short term, the crisis has led to job losses and financial problems for many businesses, particularly in a number of vulnerable sectors. this has led to extensive government support measures in order to save companies in crisis. however, it has also highlighted weaknesses in the eu ' s single market and in international trade, with unforeseen barriers and broken value chains, with a shortage of goods and closing entire industries. the pandemic will also have many long term effects ; structural transformation in the form of digitisation and conversion to more sustainable production is likely to be accelerated. the single market will be strengthened, and trade will be opened up and diversified to reduce vulnerability to the next crisis one which no one can predict ; how it will look or how it will manifest itself. the pandemic is not the only thing creating pressure for new proposals in the updated industrial strategy. at the center of this are the discussions on how the eu can best assert itself globally when it comes to being at the forefront of economic and technological development. not least, it is about ensuring that the competitiveness of eu business is properly promoted when public funds are invested in selected research projects for the technologies of the future, and that companies can work jointly to develop the

to minimise the burden on importers during the transitional period and facilitate the smooth roll out of the cbam declaration requirements after the transitional period. 2. the cbam adds an additional administrative burden to companies importing goods into the eu. additional costs are added to the price of the products, which leads to a reduction in market attractiveness and competitiveness. o currently, it is not necessary to have a certificate of origin when importing goods into the eu. the process of acquiring such a document can take time and lead to additional costs. o it is also worth considering the burden on enterprises during the preparation and submission of information to the new reporting form. especially since the dedicated it tools mentioned in the proposal are still under

negligent behaviour by the reporting declarant. according to the proposal, new reporting requires changes in the calculations of emission factors, basing them on quantity data, while the vast majority of non eu countries still use invoice value for this purpose. the required changes will lead not only to inaccurate data because this indicator (net mass) is harder to obtain and maintain, but also will require third countries to change their systems in customs and accompanying documentation. fecc is the association that represents chemical, food, and active pharmaceutical ingredients

the domestic firms. this is the only way to fully restore their international competitiveness. i suggest to implement a carbon price in the eu in the form of an upstream carbon tax on all fossil fuels extracted from the earth ' s crust within the eu, as well as on those imported from abroad. this is the least bureaucratic way to establish a carbon price that covers all co2 emissions within the eu,

necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the

for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair ""

committee, ahead of your vote on the eu ets report on april 20, we are calling on you to vote for an ambitious revision to make the eu ' s carbon market an effective tool driving industrial transformation to contribute to achieving the eu 2030 climate target and european green deal objectives. a successful revision of the eu ets should make it a tool that incentivises emission reductions, including through changes in production and consumption patterns, circularity and investments into zero carbon production processes in an integrated approach to reaching the zero pollution ambition. to achieve this objective, the ets directive must provide a strong price signal. thus, the hand out of free allocation of eu ets allowances to industry must end. instead, all ets allowances must be auctioned and the substantial amounts of additional revenues raised must be recycled into more effective climate action. looking at the ets reform proposal by the european commission, free allocation will still remain one of the main obstacles to decarbonization, innovation and the good functioning of carbon markets. the current regime of free allowances represents a massive market failure that creates an unjust and complex set of distortions for companies in and outside the ets. this is due to ill targeted handouts of free pollution permits to highly polluting incumbents. free allocation is awarded in proportion to the output of plants, which favours wasteful production over a more circular economy or demand reduction. postponing the phase out of free allocation will delay the green transition when the latest ipcc report urges us to act now to keep temperature rise to 1. 5c by drastically reducing our emissions and transforming our economies. moreover, it would also continue to undermine the business case for investment in cutting emissions in resource-and energy intensive industries. the tragedy of the ongoing war in ukraine further underlines the need to accelerate europe ' s shift towards ending dependence on fossil fuels. a robust and ambitious eu climate policy, with acting in concert with a strengthened and fair eu ets in a more complete policy toolbox, including performance based standards and regulation, is a key enabler of such an accelerated transition. we therefore call on you to vote in favor of an ambitious ets that works for the

contribution issue n5 | march 2020 a european carbon border tax : much pain, little gain georg zachmann and ben mc williams executive summary the european green deal has set a target of reducing european union carbon emissions by about 40 percent over the next ten years. reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi-cant increase in carbon prices. theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices. to address this perceived threat, the european commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the european green deal. this will apply a charge on goods imported into the eu, based on the emissions emitted during their production. the european commission should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad-justment mechanism into a must have element of its climate policy. there is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon adjustment measure. assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. energy price differentials-a proxy for carbon prices-do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy in-tensive production. furthermore, significant logistical, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions. to simplify the design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the commission has proposed focusing only on carbon intensive and trade exposed sectors. but it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non covered sectors. trade devi-ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ' cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains. a strategy of tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help eu climate policy. the eu should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the

'context': 'leakage in climate policy discourse the concept of "" leakage "" can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than

european free market emissions trading system should remain the main market instrument for europe \' s industries to cost effectively reduce their emissions. carbon and graphite products are commodities that are traded worldwide. this leads to high trade intensity and a globally competitive market. other major producers are located outside of europe and, while companies in the eu face both direct and indirect carbon costs, such costs are not faced by their other major international competitors. this situation means that european companies must absorb costs or lose competitiveness, neither of which the companies are positioned to do. in this context, the undersigned associations are legitimately concerned about the negative impact of the european parliament environment committee

multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 and the next generation eu recovery instrument to move away from a strong focus on member state contributions to common sources of revenue that simultaneously serve common eu objectives. new own resources, including the plastic levy and the proposed own resources based on the eu emissions trading system (ets) and the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), represent a significant shift in the eu ' s funding architecture to ' purposeful sources ' of revenue. this paper assesses the emergence of own resources relating to the green

(cbam) proposal. this will mark the last opportunity for the parliament and the council of the eu to fine tune the mechanism and ensure its ultimate objectives can be fulfilled. as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (eu ets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the

european union budget resources pascal saint amans executive summary there is widespread agreement on the need for new resources to fund the european union \' s budget in order to meet increasing spending demands, not least repayment of debt incurred as part of the eu \' s post pandemic economic recovery. in particular it is seen as desirable that the eu should have \' own \' resources, or reliable ongoing revenue streams. but there is little agreement on what new own resources could consist of. limited reform so far has led to the introduction of a levy paid by eu members depending on plastic packaging waste generated in their territory and not recycled. meanwhile, the european commission has proposed resources for the eu budget from emissions trading revenues, and from levies collected under the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). there proposals are pragmatic and move in the right direction, but do not go far enough. the debate about own resources should focus on whether the eu will be able to build genuine own resources based on common tax policies. the eu suffers from \' tax leakage \' in which profits are shifted from high tax to low tax eu countries, and from there onto no or low tax non eu jurisdictions, often without the application of withholding taxes. it may not be too much ofa stretch to compare this situation of tax leakage with the situation addressed by cbam-a quasi tax at the border. so far, an opportunity for what could be seen as a tax at the border of the internal market, aiming to protect the market from harmful competition, may have been missed. such a tax could reflect the undertaxed profit rule agreed as part of the international deal on the corporate minimum tax. focusing on protecting the revenues of eu

important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that

speaking with donald thomson, ceo of the center for regenerative design and collaboration (crdc). in this second interview, we will be speaking with carlos monreal, founder and ceo of plastic energy. join us as we delve deeper into the efforts of plastic energy to tackle the issue of plastic waste and create value from it. plastic waste is a global problem that has far reaching environmental impacts, and plastic energy is a company that aims to address this issue. founded by carlos monreal more than a decade ago, the company has been developing its unique tac process for plastic waste. our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company has projects in europe, asia, and the us. with three plants currently under construction in europe, plastic energy aims to recycle 5

the registry could play a pivotal role in facilitating smoother operations. furthermore, the registry offers an opportunity for competent authorities to share the burden of challenging third country operators when data are missing or lack precision. while these opportunities are promising, clepa emphasises the need to address several pressing issues to ensure the cbam is both effective and manageable. 1. access to data remains a critical challenge. one of the main challenges in the cbam is the lack of access to accurate and timely emissions data. a recent survey of clepa members revealed that 65 % of automotive suppliers receive actual emissions data from less than 10 % of their own suppliers. this significant data gap underscores the difficulty of tracking and reporting emissions, particularly for iron and steel products that move through multiple layers of the supply chain. additional barriers include the inability to switch suppliers due to existing contractual obligations or the need for regulatory approvals, including complex safety certifications. we recommend allowing the use of default or industry standard emissions values until a substantial portion of suppliers can provide verified data. we further suggest excluding one time shipments (e. g., for testing purposes) and incorporating provisions for samples and non recurring deliveries. 2. administrative burden and compliance costs. the current administrative requirements of cbam pose substantial challenges. the administrative burden and costs can amount to several hundred thousand euros per reporting period. while the cbam registry is already a step forward, we recommend the commission to continue addressing the administrative burden issue. one suggestion would be to streamline the excel template by focusing on mandatory fields and anticipated future needs (e. g. direct vs. indirect emissions after 2026). to further support compliance, we suggest translating key documents into key partner languages. 3. proposal for a weight based and cbam registration threshold. the current cbam applies uniform reporting requirements when the value of the shipment is eur 150 or more. we believe that a weight based per shipment threshold would be a more practical and efficient approach. this has proved effective in the risk based implementation of the reach regime, where a 1t annual volume threshold excludes compliance requirements for one off shipments. higher thresholds would target larger consignments with greater environmental impact, reducing administrative burden.

our tac process is a chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that

which are then used as product industry averages numbers. another approach is self imposed producer sustainability reporting, which requires trust that reporting was done correctly. usually the trust question is also solved through third party verification, which can be very expensive for producers and is often only affordable for big corporations, which diminishes the concept of free

currently only solve the question of materials origin and supply chain traceability but the first startups are adding carbon footprint tracking along the entire value chain of products. the solution for fair carbon traceability and carbon border needs to include the possibility of tracing the eco footprint of each product per each producer, and not rely on a generic "" industry average "". even in countries where carbon regulation is not imposed, there are producers who are installing renewable energy sourcing, using fuels with low carbon footprint, etc. as an example : there could be two

chemical recycling method that can prevent plastic waste from going to landfill or incineration, and its goal is to reduce pollution and the impacts of plastic waste, the executive explains. according to monreal, the industry faces significant challenges in collecting plastic waste, particularly in nations outside of europe. lack of collection and the need for extended producer responsibility (epr) schemes and clarity on chemical recycling policy are some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order to improve the collection and sorting of plastic waste for its chemical recycling process, they work with governments, local authorities, and various stakeholders in the plastics value chain. they work closely with petrochemical companies, converters, and well known brands like unilever, tupperware, and mondelez. by participating in several closed loop collaborations, they have successfully proven that chemically recycled content can be used in food grade packaging, which has a significant advantage over mechanical recycling. these collaborative efforts have resulted in commercialized products available to consumers on the european market. plastic energy has two recycling plants in spain that have been operational for the past seven years, and the company has projects in europe, asia, and the us. with three plants currently under construction in europe, plastic energy aims to recycle 5 million tonnes of plastic waste by

their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new close to carbon neutral (or net zero compatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. net zero compatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved net zero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential lose lose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a, only

economic area (eea). it will soon be extended to maritime transport, while a parallel scheme will be established for fuels consumed by buildings and road vehicles. the eu ets works by obliging all companies under its scope to surrender ' allowances ', i. e. pollution permits, for their greenhouse gas emissions. one allowance provides the right to emit one ton of co2 (or co2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases). every year, companies must surrender to the authorities a number of allowances that corresponds to their annual emissions (e. g., 1000 allowances must be surrendered for 1000 tons of co2e emissions). failure to do so leads to heavy fines. european authorities cancel the surrendered allowances. each year, fewer and fewer new allowances are issued. this effectively imposes a decreasing limit (' cap ') on the overall emissions covered by the eu ets, aligned with eu ' s decarbonization targets. since companies can trade allowances freely with each other, their price is determined by supply and demand. for the first time, in 2023 the eu ets allowance price exceeded 100. how are eu ets allowances allocated ? there are two ways to obtain allowances under the eu ets. the main way is to buy them, either at auction (primary market) or from other companies (secondary market). auctions take place daily at the european energy exchange (eex). allowances can be traded on the secondary market at any time, either directly between buyers and sellers, or indirectly through intermediaries. an alternative way to obtain allowances is to receive them from the authorities for free. during the first compliance years of the eu ets, almost all allowances were distributed to companies for free. since 2008, the percentage of freely allocated allowances has been progressively

2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set

to eu producers must be discounted from the carbon costs levied on importers, thereby allowing compatibility with the eu ets. the cbam should preferably take the form of a levy or an ets "" mirror "" measure that does not interfere with the eu carbon budget and is based on verified emissions of imports. the cbam must reflect unpredictable future variations in free allocations and carbon prices. cbam must be tested and phased in in parallel with the continuation of eu ets mechanisms, at least until it is fully operational and legally secured. context transitioning to carbon neutral construction relies on : e ensuring the attractiveness of local production, with local resources, for local use ; e incentivizing investments and innovation in circular solutions, renewable energy and advanced technologies such as carbon capture use and storage ; e creating a demand for low carbon building materials and solutions. competitive eu manufacturing, driven by investments and innovation and anchored in the low carbon transition, is conditional on a level playing field with non eu importers with regards to carbon costs. with reduced historical activity level (hal) and emission factor benchmark, this prerequisite will be accentuated during phase iv of the eu ets as, by design, free allocations do not cover 100 % of carbon costs. in the cement sector, the expected allocation deficit puts some 40 million tonnes of eu-manufactured clinker at risk of being offshored by 2030 (equivalent to > 20 % of the eu demand). the construction sector \' s transition towards carbon neutrality will significantly contribute to reaching europe \' s ambition to be a carbon neutral continent by 2050. the import of more carbon intensive products to meet the demand for construction materials in

through the eu ets cap and trade system. this system, however, has brought about disadvantages to manufacturers in the eu, leading to unfair competitive edge for companies in regions with more relaxed environmental regulations. in 2019, the european green deal was established to further enhance and accelerate the eu ' s climate and sustainability efforts. the european green deal encompasses a wide

"" what is being simplified ? the omnibus package focuses on four key areas of sustainability regulation : 1. csrd (corporate sustainability reporting directive) requires large companies to report on environmental, social, and governance (esg) performance using standardized metrics (esrs). 2. csddd (corporate sustainability due diligence directive) mandates large firms to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights and environmental risks in their supply chains. 3. eu taxonomy regulation provides a classification system for sustainable economic activities, guiding companies and investors through disclosure requirements. 4. cbam (carbon border adjustment mechanism) imposes a carbon price on certain imports to prevent carbon leakage and ensure fair competition for eu producers. key changes introduced by the omnibus package 1. higher thresholds, fewer companies covered the threshold for csrd and eu taxonomy reporting has been raised from 250 to 1, employees, aligning with the

government published its proposed structure for the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) 1, a measure to limit carbon leakage (the movement of production and associated emissions from one country to another due to different levels of decarbonization effort through carbon pricing and climate regulation), by imposing a tariff on high carbon emitting imports into the uk. having closed its consultation phase on 13 june, the final design rules are expected to be published within the next few weeks. according to the proposal, companies looking to export goods into the uk from 2027 onwards will be required to pay a tax on their scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions unless they can prove they have paid an equivalent tax in their home country. the mechanism has been developed in alignment with the uk emissions trading scheme (ets) to ensure that the carbon price paid on imported goods aligns to that currently incurred on uk manufacturers. this will help level the playing field by creating price parity between goods imported into the uk and those manufactured within. at its core, the purpose of cbam is to mitigate the risk of "" carbon leakage "", whereby carbon intensive production is offshored to countries with less stringent environmental regulations and a higher competitive advantage, ultimately resulting in equal or greater global carbon emissions overall. to limit this, sectors with large volumes of carbon emissions could face sizeable costs when exporting into the uk, unless the exporting country sets its own carbon price on par with the uk via an explicit carbon

traditional way and also maintaining the high quality standards. furthermore, it is also a political challenge. the transformation of european industry means facilitating the transformation of companies in transition like tata steel nederland for example through financial measures and faster permitting processes. at the same time, the right (framework) conditions need to be established : ensuring the necessary sufficient clean energy production, competitive network cost and also creating a market for clean products like green steel. all in a european level playing field situation,

associations are in line with our own and we see no fundamental differences. nevertheless, as stated by the eu scientific advisory board on climate change, in addition to the scientific and legal context, the use of value judgements is a key area to be considered, especially when addressing tensions between different issues and principles. we see regional differences due to the character of the respective public climate discussions. we engage in discussions on political frameworks in all our markets, in order to achieve our climate targets. any specific input on regulatory energy and

india ' s clean energy story electrifying thermal processes with renewables is a natural choice for indian industries to slash their carbon footprint while simultaneously boosting the country ' s clean energy ecosystem. industries are the largest energy end use sector in india, emitting 920 million tonnes of co2 annually. the steel and cement industries alone contribute 18 % of india ' s total emissions. with the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) legislation, there is increasing focus on decarbonising industrial energy use. understanding the ' hard to abate ' nature of industries and exploring available options is crucial for initiating decarbonization. in the near term (to 2030), transitioning from fossil fuel based electricity to renewable energy sources (res) is crucial to meet current power needs sustainably. in the long term (to 2050), industries must adopt advanced electrification and power to fuel technologies to rapidly decarbonise their emission intensive operations. green electrification will significantly change energy consumption patterns in these industries, requiring strategic planning to ensure future energy demands are met efficiently. key takeaways renewable energy can decarbonise up to 11 % of india ' s heavy industries ' current energy consumption industries rely on fossil fuel and electricity for their heat and power requirements, respectively. in 2022, india ' s heavy industriessteel, cement, aluminium, petrochemicals and ammoniaconsumed a total of 175 twh of electricity, making up 11 % of their overall energy

sustainability reporting executive summary the european union (eu) draft omnibus package 1, released february 26,2025, marks a pivotal moment in the eu \' s sustainability agenda aimed at streamlining corporate sustainability reporting. it does not represent a rollback in the eu \' s climate action ambitions-which remain as before. however, it does aim to simplify and align the reporting aspects of four pieces of legislation-the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd), the corporate sustainability due diligence directive (cs3d), the eu taxonomy regulation (eut), and the carbon border adjustment mecha-nism (cbam). the move comes in the wake of concerns regarding compliance complexity and costs, underscored by the draghi report (september 2024), which identified regulatory burden as a significant obstacle to economic growth and called for a \' competitiveness first \' energy transition. the proposed changes to the csrd, cs3d, eut, and cbam involve thresholds, timelines, and requirements. most significantly : csrd applicability thresholds are proposed to be increased which will reduce the number of companies in scope by approximately 80 %. the proposal would require reporting from entities with more than 1, employees and an annual turnover greater than 50 million (450 million for non eu companies) or assets exceeding 25 million. furthermore, report-ing timelines for companies first required to report in fy20251 (wave 2 companies) are supposed to be postponed by two years. the implementation of cs3d is recommended to be postponed to 2028, civil liability obli-gations to be removed, and due diligence requirements to be simplified. the eut scope is supposed to be aligned with the cs3d, and the draft delegated acts (da) to introduce financial materiality

steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and

after the publication of the strategy, this was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization. the pandemic has had a major impact on both the economy and on business within the eu, in both the short and long term. in the short term, the crisis has led to job losses and financial problems for many businesses, particularly in a number of vulnerable sectors. this has led to extensive government support measures in order to save companies in crisis. however, it has also highlighted weaknesses in the eu ' s single market and in international trade, with unforeseen barriers and broken value chains, with a shortage of goods and closing entire industries. the pandemic will also have many long term effects ; structural transformation in the form of digitisation and conversion to more sustainable production is likely to be accelerated. the single market will be strengthened, and trade will be opened up and diversified to reduce vulnerability to the next crisis one which no one can predict ; how it will look or how it will manifest itself. the pandemic is not the only thing creating pressure for new proposals in the updated industrial strategy. at the center of this are the discussions on how the eu can best assert itself globally when it comes to being at the forefront of economic and technological development. not least, it is about ensuring that the

very important issue ; we have already seen a move of energy intensive and ghg emissions intensive technologies to the regions with less strict control of emissions. one of the existing ways to

which are then used as product industry averages numbers. another approach is self imposed producer sustainability reporting, which requires trust that reporting was done correctly. usually the trust question is also solved through third party verification, which can be very expensive for producers and is often only affordable for big corporations, which diminishes the concept of free competitiveness and makes sme uncompetitive. there are blockchain based solutions appearing at the market as digital alternatives for materials verification and products flow traceability. these can currently only solve the question of materials origin and supply chain traceability but the first startups are adding carbon footprint tracking along the entire value chain of products. the solution for fair carbon traceability and carbon border needs to include the possibility of tracing the eco footprint of each product per each producer, and not rely on a generic "" industry average "". even in countries where carbon regulation is not imposed, there are producers who are installing renewable energy sourcing, using fuels with low carbon footprint, etc. as an example : there could be two

an eu carbon border mechanism uses an average generic number for the carbon footprint of steel from this country, this will completely disadvantage eco friendly investments. forcing such producers to

feedstock and energy prices particularly remain a significant concern, with european gas prices still four times higher than in the u. s. capacity constraints, fluctuating demand, and geopolitical factors like new tariffs under the trump administration could also greatly impact profitability in chemical sectors. to navigate these challenges, companies must reevaluate their operations and seek innovative, cost effective solutions to sustain momentum. the industry is shifting toward regionalized or localized production to ensure supply chain resilience. nearshoring and friendshoring are becoming more of a priority as companies seek to mitigate geopolitical risks, cut costs, and reduce transportation emissions. this trend brings opportunities for chemical suppliers to develop strong regional partnerships and optimize their distribution networks. customers are prioritizing sustainability, traceability, and esg (environmental, social, and governance) factors in their purchasing decisions, causing chemical companies to adapt their product portfolios and manufacturing processes to meet these demands. while challenging, this shift creates opportunities for innovative solutions

deforestation. businesses must now demonstrate compliance through traceability, due diligence, and risk assessments to maintain access to the eu market. eudr is not just a legal requirement. it marks a fundamental shift toward sustainable supply chains. companies that fail to comply face penalties, reputational risks, and potential market exclusion, while those that adapt early can gain a competitive edge and enhance their global credibility. achieving compliance requires robust data collection, supply chain transparency, and proactive engagement with suppliers. this workshop provides practical strategies, industry case studies, and best practices to help businesses navigate eudr requirements, mitigate risks, and implement effective sustainability measures. companies importing key commodities into the eu must establish robust traceability and due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the eu deforestation regulation (eudr). this is a crucial phase in preparing for full enforcement, where non compliance may lead to penalties and restricted market access. businesses will be required to provide geolocation data, risk assessments, and deforestation free verification for affected products such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, timber, and rubber. early investment in supply chain transparency, digital tracking tools, and supplier engagement can offer a competitive advantage

2022. that would leave us about 8. 5 years for a monumental transformation. that is an extremely short timeline, which can only be achieved with concerted and dedicated efforts from both policymakers and businesses. to put it clearly : without a complete and integrated strategy, that directs all our instruments, policies and spending, it is unlikely europe will achieve its industrial, digital and green objectives in 2030. this is due in particular to the fact that the short time frame and the tasks ahead can be a challenge, especially for small and medium sized enterprises, the backbone of the european economy. in this paper, the epp group sets out the broad lines of its views on how the commission \' s strategy should be completed. ecosystem at the core the epp group supports the ecosystems approach of the industrial strategy. digital and climate objectives will impact each ecosystem differently and europe \' s position in the global market varies across ecosystems as well. to

comprised of over 155 member companies spanning industrial automation, precision engineering, agriculture machinery, material handling, energy and environment, automotive, metal fabrication and processing, paper, print and engineering services. established in november 2021, engineering industries ireland (an lbec trade association) supports the development of the engineering industry both domestically and internationally. our vision is for ireland to be a global engineering center of excellence, where multinationals and home grown companies collaborate strategically to help companies become more sustainable, innovate, prosper, and drive economic growth. lreland ' s engineering sector is composed of 10,800 individual enterprises, employing over 50, people with annual exports of 8. 8 billion (representing 3. 6 % of ireland ' s total exports), 65 % of these enterprises are indigenous companies. engineering industries ireland, under the careful stewardship of our board of industry leaders, brings these discrete engineering subsectors together, into a powerful new advocacy voice for the sector. our network is structured around core working groups, taskforces and campaigns, which are the primary enablers of our strategy. in 2022, we launched our four year strategy-the main objective of which is for ' ireland to become a global engineering center of excellence '. to achieve

paris agreement are clear : as a global community, we must roughly half emissions by 2030 and reach net zero around mid century to keep the 1. 5 degree target within reach. more than 90 % of global gdp is already covered by net zero pledges, but only a small group of countries, representing approximately 10 % of global carbon emissions, have put forward clear roadmaps and a comprehensive set of sector specific policies to achieve this goal. the gcc has made enormous progress in recent years, with most gcc countries committing to net zero, and starting to pursue green growth opportunities. however, the majority of gcc countries have not yet published comprehensive plans for how to achieve their commitments and leverage green economic growth opportunities in a focused way, supported by policies. this will be the next step for many governments, and it will be critical to meet their obligations under the paris agreement, which requires both 2030 targets (' nationally determined contributions ') and ' long term strategies ' (leading to 2050 or beyond). this article distills learning and shares five key recommendations for preparing net zero plans, to help decision makers make net zero a success for their countries and economies. these recommendations are : 1) build a dynamic, country specific net zero model ; 2) choose a just net zero pathway suited for the country ' s climate ambition and economy ; 3) consider green economic growth opportunities, not just financial investment costs ; 4) establish effective stakeholder engagement and governance ; and 5) design policies that bring net zero strategies to life. 1. build a dynamic, country specific net zero model net zero is a comprehensive transformation program with implications throughout the economy. it is much more than a ' climate strategy ' and requires fundamental shifts to be embedded in all national sector strategies. preparing a cross sector, country specific net zero model is the first step for countries to become climate leaders and meet paris targets in ways that respect their unique characteristics and benefit their economies. transitioning to net zero means decarbonizing every sector in a coordinated way. the gcc ' s major carbon emitting sectors are power (including for buildings), industry, transport, and waste (exhibit 1). the composition of industry sectors varies across gcc
