climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a

cost burden for firms in the ets. it should therefore be explored if, and if so how, the free allowances can coexist with cbam. if free allowances are replaced by cbam this will drive up costs for the

nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the

the us. a new report from the energy think tank ember highlights the role of renewable electrification in avoiding 17 % of the carbon emissions from india \' s heavy industry by 2030. this report indicates possible near and long term strategies to smash emissions as india negotiates with the eu bloc on mechanisms to comply with the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). cbam is a regulatory framework that imposes a carbon tariff on imports to the eu. he eu has decided to impose a carbon tax known as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), effective from january 1,2026, on the import of 7 carbonintensive sectors including : steel products iron and iron ore concentrates cement aluminum products fertiliser hydrogen electrical energy. most consider cbam as "" discriminatory "" and a "" trade barrier "" that would hit not only indian exports but also those of many other developing nations. the tariff is as high as 2035 % on imports of these highcarbon goods. to fully decarbonise their electricity use and remain competitive in the global market, india \' s heavy industries require 120 gw of dedicated renewable energy capacity by 2030. the report focuses on the steel, cement, petrochemicals, aluminum and ammonia sectors. decarbonising these emissionintensive "" heavy "" industries can significantly benefit both india \' s industrial sector and renewable energy ecosystem. currently, 11 % of energy consumption in these heavy industries comes from electricity, with the rest from fossil fuelbased thermal energy. based on industry growth projections, electricity demand for heavy industries is expected to rise by 45 %. meeting this increased demand with renewable energy could help to avoid 180 million tons (mt) of co2, equivalent to

energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in europe and elsewhere. the role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. gas supplied 43 percent of u. s. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. as policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas. to probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of u. s. manufacturing from a carbonintensity perspective. this paper presents the key findings from csis ' s researchincluding from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviewsand policy recommendations on how the united states can maintain
