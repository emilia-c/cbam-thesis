these votes represent the final step in the process of finalising these three interlinked pillars of the green deal. while the eu is reducing emissions from its own industries, emissions associated with goods imported into the eu have increased in recent years. with the introduction of the cbam, the eu has finally agreed to end ' free pollution permits ' as importers pay a pollution price, eu

thereby contributing to the achievement of the 1. 5 c paris target. the cbam decarbonisation incentive will increase over the next few years, as cbam will eventually cover all most polluting sectors and possibly all types of emissions. as the cbam scope is expanded, the greens / efa group will push for the eu to increase its financial support to poorer countries, which do not bear historic responsibility for climate change and should not be unfairly hit by the eu external carbon price. the reform of the eu carbon market (est ii) will incentivise the energy and industrial sectors to fully decarbonize. although the greens / efa group pushed for a more ambitious phase out of free co2 certificates, the annual number of co2 certificates to be distributed will be reduced gradually to zero by 2040. in return, industries that modernise and transform will get more support through the increased innovation fund and modernisation fund. the prospect of this change has already led to a surge in the market carbon price, which, if sustained, is likely to phase out coal in the eu already before 2030. the reform also sends a clear signal that everyone will eventually have to invest in

with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new

your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the

the topic. taxes allow us to build better societies and to invest in the things that matter most : safety and security, quality education, roads and so on. so we must continue to focus on how we structure taxes in a way that advances our economies and first and foremost the well being of our people. today i ' ll mention a couple of things : first, on the competitiveness agenda ; second and closely tied to competitiveness, the role of tax in supporting the green transition ; and third, how we should work on fairness and transparency in taxation. first, on competitiveness. as you know last week, we unveiled the commission ' s new roadmap for the next five years called the competitiveness compass. it identifies what we need to do to boost competitiveness, clearly highlighting the need for a competitiveness driven approach to decarbonisation. decarbonisation not only as a climate strategy but also as a clean growth strategy. we ' ll finalise the clean industrial deal at the end of the month. our goal is to present industry with a stronger business case for large climate neutral investments in energy intensive industries and clean tech. so what does this mean for tax policy ? we ' ll look into recommendations on immediate expensing and accelerated depreciation to encourage business to invest in clean tech production. we ' ll also look into if and how we update the state aid framework to ensure it ' s fit for purpose. and we ' ll continue to work on current legislative proposals such as befit that will enhance eu competitiveness. we ' re also very much aware that high energy prices are a major challenge for businesses large and small across our union. to address this, we ' ll look into the role of levies, charges but also taxes. on top of that, it ' s clear that complexity and red tape – created at european level but also to the same degree at member states level – needs to be tackled. therefore we ' re exploring in each and every domain what we can do,

they agreed to increase cooperation on tackling the climate crisis, which no single country can solve on its own. both parties wholeheartedly underlined that climate science shows the urgency of action in this decade to meet the targets of the paris agreement. the impacts of the climate crisis are dramatically felt both in china and the eu and remind us of the responsibility to fully commit to emissions reductions while making our economies more resilient. they discussed the key issues at stake at cop28 including the global stocktake, decarbonisation of the energy systems, climate adaptation, climate finance and carbon pricing, and the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund. commissioner hoekstra highlighted the importance of ambition on emission reductions at cop28 via the outcome of the global stocktake. in particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030, to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels. they discussed at length what the end of coal and other fossil fuels means for industrial restructuring and how to make these efforts compatible with energy security concerns. on the issue of climate finance, the commissioner underlined that all parties able to contribute should do so in general, and in particular for the loss and damage fund. he also recalled the eu ' s role as the world ' s largest provider of international climate finance. commissioner hoekstra agreed to work closely together with special envoy xie ahead of and during cop28 to ensure a successful outcome for all parties. decades of continuous cooperation by the eu and china in the multilateral climate negotiations provide a strong foundation. commissioner hoekstra commended special envoy xie on china ' s massive increase in renewable energy capacity over recent years. beyond cop, he committed to continue close eu china cooperation on climate issues such as carbon pricing and the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), measuring and reducing methane emissions, and scientific analysis. the
