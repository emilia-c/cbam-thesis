and investments outside of europe, triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the

jeopardising eu exports, accordingly. overall, eubased manufactures will face an increase of at least 510 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon

reconciling international subsidy rules with industrial decarbonisation environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to netzero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra) national industrial decarbonisation efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie antiforeign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonisation at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the crossborder negative economic impacts of otherwise netglobalwelfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net globalwelfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, the world trade organisation \' s trade and environment committee and wto trade and environmental sustainability structured discussions, and the coalition of trade ministers on climate. the author thanks ronald steenblik, jeromin zettelmeyer,

that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the netzero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluterpays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition

what is a carbon border adjustment mechanism ? a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a tax applied to certain imported goods, based on the amount of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions released during their production. it targets industries that are typically emissionsintensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissionsintensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at', 'reference': '914', 'full_answer': 'many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies.', 'sentence_beginning': ' many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make ', 'sentence_end': ' for them to decarbonise their economies.', 'similarity_score': 0.7511093020439148}, {'answer': 'cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe', 'confidence': np.float32(0.02262637), 'start': np.int64(66), 'end': np.int64(95), 'context': 'on june 7, the european parliament will cast its final vote on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) proposal. this will mark the last opportunity for the parliament and the council of the eu to fine tune the mechanism and ensure its ultimate objectives can be fulfilled. as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe. in other words, incentivising industrial delocalisation. putting a price on carbon is not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (euets), the first and largest binding carbon market ever put in place. for sectors considered to be "" at risk of carbon leakage "", a system of free allowances was introduced to secure jobs and investments in europe. in this regard, ets free allowances served to preserve competitiveness and ensure a fair and gradual economic transition to a decarbonised economy. by design, the eu \' s proposed mechanism strives to replicate the european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive, when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. let \' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the euets, nor to cbam. such a scenario not only falls short of the objectives set by the european green deal, as it does not reduce co2 emissions outside of the eu ,', 'reference': '155', 'full_answer': 'as it stands, cbam lacks the necessary provisions to effectively prevent carbon leakage in downstream products, potentially stimulating a transfer of carbon emissions, production and investments outside of europe.', 'sentence_beginning': ' as it stands, ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7420567274093628}]",industrial decarbonisation

brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 %

not an easy task. over the past two decades, europe has become a world leader in carbon pricing policies with the development of its emissions trading system (euets), the first and largest binding

european carbon price on imported goods, in a way for european producers and international competitors to pay the same price on carbon, regardless of the place of production. in a nutshell, cbam aspires to align the eu \' s ramped up environmental ambition with global trade, in an effort for the eu to become a global leader in the race towards climate neutrality. cbam is nevertheless an experiment whose unintended consequences must be carefully assessed. as mentioned in the impact assessment, the mechanism was designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and that would this way become less competitive,

can be employed in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country a', 'reference': '920', 'full_answer': 'introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and

some of the industry \' s challenges. in terms of the supply chain, demand for recycled content is higher than what can be supplied, which is why chemical recycling is needed, he clarifies. in order

adopted a communication on business taxation for the 21st century ? the eu needs a robust, efficient and fair business tax framework that supports the post covid19 recovery, removes obstacles to crossborder investment in the single market and creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a longterm vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models

steel mills. think again. the numbers paint a surprising picture : over 75 % of companies affected by cbam are actually importers of downstream products like screws, nuts, and brackets. these importers represent less than 15 % of the eu ' s total cbam product volume in iron and steel a striking imbalance that highlights a unique challenge. how did we get here ? the story starts with sound environmental policy. the eu aimed to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers of iron and steel amid the push to decarbonize its domestic industries. as eu manufacturers face increasing carbon costs through ets, cbam emerged to ensure consistent carbon pricing across borders. the cbam process was designed around the supply chain of the eu ' s energy intensive industries : iron & steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement (plus electricity & hydrogen, but we ' ll ignore these for this post), and covered the products made by those plants covered by the ets. it ensured that the products made by this industry would be covered by carbon pricing whether they were made in the eu (through the ets) or imported (via cbam). but a broader perspective emerged, especially in the iron, steel and aluminium industries : including only primary forms of these metals (ore, ingots, coils) in cbam might shift downstream manufacturing that uses these products outside the eu, as finished products could enter without carbon pricing. including downstream products addressed this concern. that ' s how finished iron, steel and aluminum products in hs chapters 73 and 76 were added to cbam from the outset, with an immediate commitment to add more downstream products in the medium term. the numbers tell a tale this changed the dynamic and the composition of the group of companies covered by cbam. from relatively homogenous groups of companies in a few industries covered by ets, cbam expanded to a wide variety of companies across countless industries. most of these companies had never dealt with the ets and its emissions calculations. cbam now affects not just those who mostly import and make cbam goods, but also those for who cbam goods is only a fraction of their imports. a recent survey of 425 german importers reveals the current landscape : for > 50 % of importers, cbam goods represent < 10 % of their import volume 56 % simply cannot source their imported

heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it harder for them to decarbonise their economies. analysis also suggests that the eu \' s cbam, in isolation, will have a limited impact on global

occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. fifty years later, a metaphorical application of this can be found in the eu ' s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism. seeking to help

triggering a substantial loss of european jobs, with no positive impact on the environment. one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products on the eu single market. the mechanism was in fact originally designed for raw materials and electricity, while the inclusion of finished products was discarded due to administrative complexity. finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the eu. the carbon will simply be emitted elsewhere. if carbonintensive downstream products are more competitive than sustainable alternatives, the total balance of carbon emissions may be aggravated. let ' s take the case of a washing machine manufactured in europe. the cost of carbon emissions will apply on the aluminium, iron and steel used in the production process, whether these have been supplied in the eu (subject to the euets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing

overall, eubased manufactures will face an increase of at least 510 % of manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer,

areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions
