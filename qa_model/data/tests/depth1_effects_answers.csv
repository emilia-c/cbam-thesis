and necessary technical adjustments to the 2021-2027 budget to ensure that it can deliver until the end of the period. more concretely : does this mean additional financing by eu member states ? the mff was decided back in 2020, since then, the world has drastically changed. the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions. these effects are felt in ukraine, in the union as well as in the rest of the world including our close neighbours. while the multiannual nature of the eu budget provides stability and predictability, it has limited capacity to respond to major unexpected events, and its flexibilities are being depleted as extensive use of redeployments and

have set ourselves. reduction by 55 % by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 is not just a wish ; it is a legal obligation. and i think that should be the starting point of our discussion today. parliament was also quick to rightfully call what we ' re in a climate emergency. we saw what the floods did last year in germany, in belgium and even in the netherlands : killing people, levels of destruction we have never seen. we had a tornado in the czech republic – never before. we have completely erratic weather patterns : snow in spain when you do not expect it, droughts and floods all

renewables in europe, is money that stays in europa. money spent on fossil fuel bought in russia is money that disappears and putin ' s pockets and is then used to wage a war against his peaceful neighbors. this reality is the reality that should dictate the urgency of the measures we need to take. today, i would like to plead for two things. i would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets and also i would urge you to make sure that in doing this, we leave no one behind. our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy. i have to admit with all the

the end of 2025. the draft implementing regulation published today details the reporting obligations and information sought from eu importers of cbam goods, as well as the provisional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of cbam goods. in the cbam ' s transitional phase, traders will only have to report on the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism without paying any financial adjustment. this will give time for businesses to prepare and will provide the necessary information to fine tune the definitive methodology by 2026. the draft implementing regulation provides for some flexibility when it comes to the values used to calculate embedded emissions on imports. during the first year of implementation, companies will have the choice of reporting in three ways : (a) full reporting according to the new methodology (eu method) ; (b) reporting based on equivalent third country national systems ; and (c) reporting based on reference values. as of 1 january 2025, only the eu method will be accepted. this gradual approach will give producers time to adapt in a predictable manner. the commission is also developing dedicated it tools to help importers perform and report these calculations, as well as in depth guidance, training materials and tutorials to support businesses when the transitional mechanism begins. while importers will be asked to collect fourth quarter data as of 1 october 2023, their first report will only have to be submitted by the end of january 2024. in a fully transparent process, the

trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. the sectors currently covered by the eu ets account for around 41 % of the eu ' s total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target. the commission is proposing that emissions from the current eu ets sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. this represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current-43 % contribution from the system to the eu ' s climate target. to reach this target, the commission proposes a steeper annual emissions reduction of 4. 2 %

following the unprecedented economic crisis triggered by the covid 19 pandemic, the eu agreed on next generation eu, the largest stimulus package ever financed through the eu budget. next generation eu currently deploys more than € 800 billion (in current prices, € 750 billion in constant 2018 prices), raised on capital markets, to fund specific recovery and resilience actions in a limited period of time, in order to boost economic growth and invest in a greener and more digital future. on 16 december 2020 the european parliament, the council and the commission agreed to accompany next generation eu with a roadmap to introduce new own resources. the three institutions agreed that ' the expenditure from the union budget related to the repayment of the european union recovery instrument should not lead to an undue reduction in programme expenditure or investment instruments under the multiannual financial framework ' and that ' the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the repayment.

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

for which programmes ? the proposal covers a targeted set of political priorities and necessary technical adjustments to the 2021-2027 budget to ensure that it can deliver until the end of the period. more concretely : does this mean additional financing by eu member states ? the mff was decided back in 2020, since then, the world has drastically changed. the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions. these effects are felt in ukraine, in the union as well as in the rest of the world including our close neighbours. while the multiannual nature of the eu budget provides stability and predictability, it has limited capacity to respond to major unexpected events, and its flexibilities are being depleted as extensive use of redeployments and reprogramming, on top of existing budgetary flexibilities, has been necessary to address the unforeseen challenges. faced with this situation, the commission sees no alternative to ensure that the eu can deliver on all its objectives, especially the most urgent ones, until the end of 2027, than to propose a targeted revision of the multiannual financial framework 2021 – 2027. how is the commission proposing to support ukraine ? the commission is proposing the creation of an integrated and flexible instrument, the ukraine facility, with an overall capacity of € 50 billion over 2024-2027. the amounts will be defined on an annual basis depending on ukraine ' s evolving needs and implementation capacities. underpinned by a ukraine plan to be presented by the government of ukraine, the ukraine facility will support ukraine ' s efforts to sustain macro financial stability, promote recovery as well as modernise the country whilst implementing key reforms on its eu accession track. the financing will be provided in the form of loans and non repayable support (‘ grants ' and guarantees), with the actual distribution being determined annually. thanks to this construction the instrument will provide certainty for a multiannual commitment and flexibility to adjust annually to evolving needs on the ground. this translates into stable and predictable funding under a framework that ensures the protection of"", 'reference': '28', 'full_answer': ""the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions."", 'sentence_beginning': ' the economic and social effects ', 'sentence_end': ' are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price', 'confidence': np.float32(0.000106912994), 'start': np.int64(239), 'end': np.int64(333), 'context': ""1. what is the euemissions trading system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?
