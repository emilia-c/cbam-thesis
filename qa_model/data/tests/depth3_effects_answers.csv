metals, fertilisers, ceramic, cement, refineries, chemicals, glass, lime, waste, pulp and paper, as well as producers of clean energy and alternative energy carriers, off takers and financial institutions. let me start by saying thatenergy intensive industries are a pillar of the eu ' s economy. you play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value. and i know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the covid 19 pandemic and then russia ' s war against ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. to mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on european businesses, the commission put in place a number of measures, including : the energy situation has now somewhat stabilised ; however today ' sgas prices are still twice as high compared to pre crisis levels. so i know the impact they have on your businesses is still very significant. and, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future. there is no silver bullet to lower them. rather, we need to double down on our overall aims. that meansaccelerating the green transition : we mustscale up renewables roll out, improve energy efficiency, invest in energy storage solutions and in hydrogen, and enhance our domestic manufacturing capacity of clean technologies. the european green deal plays a vital role in this. it is not only our plan to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. it is also europe ' s growth strategy. it

representatives of european industries and social partners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be back with you here in antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. last year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production.', 'reference': '54', 'full_answer': 'prime

who designed and will implement the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). your event is very timely. if you are exporting iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizer, electricity or hydrogen to the eu, you will have to report these products ' co2 emissions from 1 january 2024 onwards. today, i would like to explain why the eu has decided to take this measure. the director general will then walk you through the mechanism, best known by its acronym : “ cbam ”. let me first recall the beginnings of cbam. our generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth : pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change. these crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50 % below normal in august and september. it impacted agriculture, energy production, and more. in europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world. we are observing these

the last year and a half-two years. if we are going to do what we promised, or what we ' re legally obliged to do, the european union which is to reach climate neutrality in 2050, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, we need to really change many of our policies. but at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will apply a new emissions

industries and social partners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be back with you here in antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. last year, i came to antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. it was a new start for industrial policy in europe at that time. since then, we at the commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production. i', 'reference': '54', 'full_answer': 'prime minister, you

of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by

because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of

decreasing global co2 emissions. as social democrats we demand transparent and predictable conditions, so that industry – in and outside the eu – can adjust and get ready. therefore we need a gradual,

in the coming year to pass all the climate legislation from the ‘ fit for 55 package ’ to reduce emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, including the legislative proposal for a carbon border adjustment

the union ’ s domestic co2 emissions. obviously, this hampers our fight against climate change and undermines the important measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism can be the missing piece of the puzzle in the efforts to reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far from being a hidden tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions, the cbam can

all of us. last year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures. rainfall in the yangtze area was only 40 % of what is

the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such measures could"", 'reference': '35', 'full_answer': 'the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes.', 'sentence_beginning': ' the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7618187069892883}, {'answer': '?

eu to increase its financial support to poorer countries, which do not bear historic responsibility for climate change and should not be unfairly hit by the eu external carbon price. the reform of the

still very significant. and, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future. there is no silver bullet to lower them. rather, we need to double down on our overall aims. that meansaccelerating the green transition : we mustscale up renewables roll out, improve energy efficiency, invest in energy storage solutions and in hydrogen, and enhance our domestic manufacturing capacity of clean technologies. the european green deal plays a vital role in this. it is not only our plan to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. it is also europe ' s growth strategy. it fosters innovation and competitiveness, while helping ensure we leave a planet liveable for future generations. the green deal is also strengthening our open strategic autonomy, enabling europe to remain aglobal leader when it comes to green tech and clean tech. for example, we are acting

madame la ministre, honorable members, it is a year since you have decided to adopt the climate law. a historic decision, but it ' s only the beginning of the beginning of a very difficult process. and therefore, today, i believe we ' re faced with some really, really difficult choices that will determine whether we stay within the legal boundaries we have set ourselves. reduction by 55 % by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 is not just a wish ; it is a legal obligation. and i think that should be the starting point of our discussion today. parliament was also quick to rightfully call what we ' re in a climate emergency. we saw what the floods did last year in germany, in belgium and even in the netherlands : killing people, levels of destruction we have never seen. we had a tornado in the czech republic – never before. we have completely erratic weather patterns : snow in spain when you do not expect it, droughts and floods all over the place when you do not expect it. i do not think there ' s any european citizen we need to convince that we ' re in the middle of a climate crisis. it ' s not a crisis that will be coming down the road. it is here already. what we need to do is make this transition happen. the war is only accentuated the importance of making this transition happen as quickly as possible. money spent on renewables in europe, is money that stays in europa. money spent on fossil fuel bought in russia is money that disappears and putin ' s pockets and is then used to wage a war against his peaceful neighbors. this reality is the reality that should dictate the urgency of the measures we need to take. today, i would like to plead for two things. i would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets and also i would urge you to make sure that in doing this, we leave no one behind. our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy. i have to admit with all the admiration i have for what parliament has done so far, some of your positions do worry me. first, emissions trading for fuels and road transport and buildings. this is an incredibly important extra tool to tackle emissions and buildings and

barbaric war. so one can say that russia has become the most sanctioned nation in the world, which is a very dubious honour indeed. if we look at the impact of the sanctions on russia, we see the rouble has crashed. trading on the moscow stock exchange remains suspended. russia ' s credit rating has been downgraded to junk status – just about default levels. many international companies are

not expect it. i do not think there ' s any european citizen we need to convince that we ' re in the middle of a climate crisis. it ' s not a crisis that will be coming down the road. it is here already. what we need to do is make this transition happen. the war is only accentuated the importance of making this transition happen as quickly as possible. money spent on renewables in europe, is money that stays in europa. money spent on fossil fuel bought in russia is money that disappears and putin ' s pockets and is then used to wage a war against his peaceful neighbors. this reality is the reality that should dictate the urgency of the measures we need to take. today, i would like to plead for two things. i would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets

phases out free allowances for companies and creates a separate new ets ii for road transport fuels and buildings, which will put a price on emissions from these sectors as of 2027. the final agreement is significantly improved compared to the negotiating position adopted in june 2022. it includes several key points for the ecr group, such as additional free allowances for district heating, the removal of any conditionality clauses for access to the modernisation fund, eligibility of gas investments from the increased modernisation fund and a slower phase out of free allowances for industry. regarding the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the ets, the ecr group is of the opinion that with a gradual phase in until 2026, negotiators found a well balanced compromise. on the eu ’ s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), which aims to create a level playing field for the sectors covered by introducing a levy corresponding to the price of ets allowances on imported goods, the ecr group believes that the more cautious approach found in the provisional agreement, especially in the phase down of free allowances for the concerned sectors, better reflects the fact that the cbam is a new mechanism and no one knows if it will work in practice. the ecr remains concerned about certain elements in the text, such as the expected higher costs for companies in the covered sectors, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers and may make eu export industries less competitive on the global market. the ecr group also welcomes in principle the eu ’ s social climate fund to help vulnerable households, micro enterprises and transport users particularly affected by energy and transport poverty, especially the aspect of member states getting support for implementation. however, the group is against the introduction of further eu own resources to finance the fund. with regard to the revision of the eu ets for aviation, the ecr

information sought from eu importers of cbam goods, as well as the provisional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of cbam goods. in the cbam ' s transitional phase, traders will only have to report on the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism without paying any financial adjustment. this will give time for businesses to prepare and will provide the necessary information to fine tune the definitive methodology by 2026. the draft implementing regulation provides for some flexibility when it comes to the values used to calculate embedded emissions on imports. during the first year of implementation, companies will have the choice of reporting in three ways : (a) full reporting according to the new methodology (eu method) ; (b) reporting based on equivalent third country national systems ; and (c) reporting based on reference values. as of 1 january 2025, only the eu method will be accepted. this gradual approach will give producers time to adapt in a predictable manner. the commission is also developing dedicated it tools to help importers perform and report these calculations, as well as in depth

system ? the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ? today, the european commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the eu ets in line with the eu ' s more ambitious

in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing

still below two degrees, and some countries even challenged the fact that paris ever spoke of 1. 5. in addition, countries that do not have national determined contributions in line with this 1. 5 degree target will have to come back next year to deliver the required update. for the first time, the parties of cop26 agreed to phase down coal and fossil fuel subsidies. whatever you may think about the precise language that was necessary to get the whole package over the finish line, this is a big win. of course, if you compare the phase down with the initial formulation to phase out, you ' re disappointed. but as greenpeace said in glasgow, changing a word does not change the signal. the era of coal is ending ! before glasgow the commission set three objectives. one to push for emission cuts that brings us within paris territory with ndcs that keep global warming well below two degrees while aiming for 1. 5. second, to close the gap on the $ 100 billion climate finance goal, while ramping up support for adaptation. and third, to complete the paris rulebook so that we can keep track of progress and hold countries to account. the paris rulebook, which seems like an esoteric subject sometimes, but it ' s essential to have carbon markets actually function in a way we want them to function. on all these three issues, we saw clear progress. two years ago in the cop in

price on carbon. so one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in europe is our emissions trading system. the principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on co2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost efficient solutions. at the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation. we know that carbon pricing works. the system currently covers 45 % of all eu emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ets sectors have been cut by around 43 %. some of us will remember that when we voted the ets system back then there was a lot of resistance. in initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism ; it did not work, the price was too low. but i do not think that applies any longer. i think it ' s making school, because besides the european system, canada, china also, japan, new zealand, south korea, switzerland, and parts of the united states are either operating or developing their own systems. under the green deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ets has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non ets sectors we ' ve not had the same level of success so far. just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down. we will

of a carbon border adjustment mechanism can be the missing piece of the puzzle in the efforts to reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far from being a hidden tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions, the

target of at least 55 per cent net emission reductions by 2030 compared to 1990. the emissions trading system (ets) revision proposal, that strengthens and boosts the contribution of the ets, is the cornerstone of the ‘ fit for 2030 ’ legislative package, which amends the existing climate and energy legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in

proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at

installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or

road transport fuels and buildings, which will put a price on emissions from these sectors as of 2027. the final agreement is significantly improved compared to the negotiating position adopted in june 2022. it includes several key points for the ecr group, such as additional free allowances for district heating, the removal of any conditionality clauses for access to the modernisation fund, eligibility of gas investments from the increased modernisation fund and a slower phase out of free allowances for industry. regarding the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the ets, the ecr group is of the opinion that with a gradual phase in until 2026, negotiators found a well balanced compromise. on the eu ’ s carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), which aims to create a level playing field for the sectors covered by introducing a levy corresponding to the price of ets allowances on imported goods, the ecr group believes that the more cautious approach found in the provisional agreement, especially in the phase down of free allowances for the concerned sectors, better reflects the fact that the cbam is a new mechanism and no one knows if it

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified

predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you

eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading

from eu importers of cbam goods, as well as the provisional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of cbam goods. in the cbam ' s transitional phase, traders will only have to report on the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism without paying any financial adjustment. this will give time for businesses to prepare and will provide the necessary information to fine tune the definitive methodology by 2026. the draft implementing regulation provides for some flexibility when it comes to the values used to calculate embedded emissions on imports. during the first year of implementation, companies will have the choice of reporting in three ways : (a) full reporting according to the new methodology (eu method) ; (b) reporting based on equivalent third country national systems ; and (c) reporting based on reference values. as of 1 january 2025, only the eu method will be accepted. this gradual approach will give producers time to adapt in a predictable manner. the commission is also developing dedicated it tools to help importers perform and report these calculations, as well as in depth guidance,

the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial

the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such

mechanism : decreasing global co2 emissions. as social democrats we demand transparent and predictable conditions, so that industry – in and outside the eu – can adjust and get ready. therefore we need a gradual, yet rapid, phase out of the free allowances within the emission trading system (ets), once the cbam is introduced. we count on the commission to bring clarity on this matter. we will be working hard in the coming year to pass all the climate legislation from the ‘ fit for 55 package ’ to reduce emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, including the legislative proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism. the message is clear : we want the commission to come up with an ambitious proposal that sets the eu on the right side of history when it comes to fighting climate change. s & d co ordinator in the environment committee, jytte guteland mep, said : the eu is the world ' s largest carbon importer, with net imports of goods and services in the eu representing more than a fifth of the union ’ s domestic co2 emissions. obviously, this hampers our fight against climate change and undermines the important measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism can be the missing piece of the puzzle in the efforts to reduce emissions, but also to ensure that the responsibility to halt climate change is also shared by other actors beyond the eu. this is about europe showing leadership and doing what is right. far from being a hidden tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions, the cbam can turn out to be a great asset, both for the climate and as a strong economic incentive to develop production methods with a lower greenhouse gas footprint, and can spur investments in innovation and new technologies. this"", 'reference': '92', 'full_answer': ""s & d co ordinator in the environment committee, jytte guteland mep, said : the eu is the world ' s largest carbon

legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or for adding to the scope small ships under 5000 grt (gross register tonnage)

introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to

the eu is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such measures could support"", 'reference': '35', 'full_answer': 'such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': ' and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts.', 'similarity_score': 0.8065208196640015}, {'answer': 'of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030', 'confidence': np.float32(0.12930898), 'start': np.int64(235), 'end': np.int64(248), 'context': ""on 16 november, eu commissioner for climate action, wopke hoekstra met china ' s special envoy on climate change, xie zhenhua, in beijing, to prepare for the cop28 un climate change conference in dubai. in a frank and constructive exchange, they agreed to increase cooperation on tackling the climate crisis, which no single country can solve on its own. both parties wholeheartedly underlined that climate science shows the urgency of action in this decade to meet the targets of the paris agreement. the impacts of the climate crisis are dramatically felt both in china and the eu and remind us of the responsibility to fully commit to emissions reductions while making our economies more resilient. they discussed the key issues at stake at cop28 including the global stocktake, decarbonisation of the energy systems, climate adaptation, climate finance and carbon pricing, and the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund. commissioner hoekstra highlighted the importance of ambition on emission reductions at cop28 via the outcome of the global stocktake. in particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030, to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels. they discussed at length what the end of coal and other fossil fuels means for industrial restructuring and how to make these efforts compatible with energy security concerns. on the issue of climate finance, the commissioner underlined that all parties able to contribute should do so in general, and in particular for the loss and damage fund. he also recalled the eu ' s role as the world ' s largest provider of international climate finance. commissioner hoekstra agreed to work closely together with special envoy xie ahead of and during cop28 to ensure a successful outcome for all parties. decades of continuous cooperation by the eu and china in the multilateral climate negotiations provide a strong foundation. commissioner hoekstra commended special envoy xie on china ' s massive increase in renewable energy capacity over recent years. beyond cop, he committed to continue close eu china cooperation on climate issues such as carbon pricing and the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), measuring and reducing methane emissions, and scientific analysis. the commissioner also raised concerns from the european side about the global level playing field, and expressed his commitment to creating mutual benefits from the green transition in areas such as innovation, clean technologies and industrial decarbonisation."", 'reference': '48', 'full_answer': 'in particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030, to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels.', 'sentence_beginning': ' in particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and ', 'sentence_end': ', to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels.', 'similarity_score': 0.7572693228721619}, {'answer': ""?

8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today

the commission is proposing the creation of an integrated and flexible instrument, the ukraine facility, with an overall capacity of € 50 billion over 2024-2027. the amounts will be defined on an annual basis depending on ukraine ' s evolving needs and implementation capacities. underpinned by a ukraine plan to be presented by the government of ukraine, the ukraine facility will support ukraine ' s efforts to sustain macro financial stability, promote recovery as well as modernise the country whilst implementing key reforms on its eu accession track. the financing will be provided in the form of loans and non repayable support (‘ grants ' and guarantees), with the actual distribution being determined annually. thanks to this construction the instrument will provide certainty for a multiannual commitment and flexibility to adjust annually to evolving needs on the ground. this translates into stable and predictable funding under a framework that"", 'reference': '28', 'full_answer': ""the economic and social effects from russia ' s war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions."", 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7539623379707336}, {'answer': 'eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels', 'confidence': np.float32(0.018863779), 'start': np.int64(124), 'end': np.int64(140), 'context': 'context the european steel industry is fundamental for european economy, providing critical inputs to many sectors, including automotive, construction, and defence. around five hundred production sites across 22 member states contribute about eur 80 billion in gdpand underpin over 2. 5 million jobs. steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio economic and political importance. however, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non market overcapacity and decreased demand. consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. this undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects. the recently published eu competitiveness compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross sectoral actions for the next years. it recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. the euclean industrial deal (published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the eu remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy intensive industries. building on this foundation, additional sector specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered. objective the objective of the steel dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step change in competitiveness of the european steel sector and to safeguard value creation and high quality jobs in the eu. building on the clean transition dialogueon steel in march 2024 and follow up input, which helped form a collective understanding of the challenges, the ambition is now to work together to craft a dedicated steel and metals action plan, to be launched in spring of this year. format and participants the steel dialogue will bring together key representatives of industry, notably steel manufacturers, suppliers of raw materials and off takers, along with representatives of social partners and civil society. it will be, chaired by president von der leyen. wider consultations with other stakeholders across the industry as well as other parts of the steel value chain will also be conducted and will feed into the steel and metals action plan, to be presented under the leadership of executive vice president for prosperity and industrial strategy stephane sejourne. the council and european parliament will be informed and consulted on the dialogue. proposed elements for discussion competitiveness and circularity ensuring globally competitive input costs and security of supply is critical for the european steel industry. the dialogue is an opportunity to', 'reference': '43', 'full_answer': 'consequently, eu production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels.', 'sentence_beginning': ' consequently, ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.704889714717865}, {'answer': 'bring total savings in annual administrative costs of around eur 6. 3 billion', 'confidence': np.float32(0.010111287), 'start': np.int64(489), 'end': np.int64(502), 'context': ""1. why are you proposing this omnibus legislation on sustainability rules ? the recent competitiveness compass sets the vision for strengthening the eu ' s competitiveness and making the eu ' s economy more prosperous, building on the recommendations of the draghi report. to boost our competitiveness and unleash growth, the eu needs to foster a favourable business environment and ensure that companies are not stifled by excessive regulatory burdens. this, in turn, will enable our businesses to grow and create quality jobs, attract investments and get the necessary funds for their transition towards a more sustainable economy and help the eu meet the green deal ' s ambitious objectives. we need to get the balance right. today, the commission is also adopting a clean industrial deal, bringing together climate and competitiveness under an overarching growth strategy. that is why the commission is recalibrating some eu rules in a growth friendly manner that will enable more cost effective delivery of our policy objectives. the commission has a clear target to deliver an unprecedented simplification effort, by achieving at least 25 % reduction in administrative burdens and at least 35 % for smes before the end of the mandate. the commission ' s work programme, published on 11 february, announced a first series of “ omnibus ” packages. they will address overlapping, unnecessary or disproportionate rules that are creating unnecessary burden for eu businesses. today ' s proposals will provide substantial simplification in the field of sustainability and eu investment programmes. the commission prioritises efforts in this area in line with the draghi report, the competitiveness compass and the findings of the commission ' s call for evidence in 2023. the package includes amendments to the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd), the corporate sustainability due diligence directive (csddd), the carbon adjustment mechanism (cbam), and the invest eu regulation. the package is accompanied by a draft taxonomy delegated act for public consultation. the aim is to square the eu ' s ambition towards a sustainable transition with enhancing eu companies ' competitiveness. 2. what changes are you proposing today ?

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of ‘ cap and trade '. it sets an absolute limit or ‘ cap ' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “ saved ” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

not expect it. i do not think there ' s any european citizen we need to convince that we ' re in the middle of a climate crisis. it ' s not a crisis that will be coming down the road. it is here already. what we need to do is make this transition happen. the war is only accentuated the importance of making this transition happen as quickly as possible. money spent on renewables in europe, is money that stays in europa. money spent on fossil fuel bought in russia is money that disappears and putin ' s pockets and is then used to wage a war against his peaceful neighbors. this reality is the reality that should dictate the urgency of the measures we need to take. today, i would like to plead for two things. i would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets and also i would urge you to make sure that in doing this, we leave no one behind. our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy. i have to admit with all the admiration i have for what parliament has done so far, some of your positions do worry me. first, emissions trading for fuels and road transport and buildings. this is an incredibly important extra tool to tackle emissions and buildings and transport. in transport, emissions are not just rising gradually. they ' re shooting up instead of going down. in buildings, we need to double our effort to reduce consumption"",

an amazing line up for this conference with meps, industry leaders, innovators, academics. a very warm welcome to each and every one of you. we ' re here in one of the most beautiful places in all of brussels, the palais d ' egmont. when i ' m here, i ' m always struck by the notion that europe is sometimes referred to as ‘ the museum of the world '. it ' s true – we have a rich cultural heritage that we ' re proud to preserve and showcase. look more closely, however. this building has been restored and reimagined for the 21st century. just like this palace blends old and new, europe has always been a union of tradition and innovation. today, as we drive clean growth, innovation, and a more sustainable future, this is more crucial than ever. over the past few months, i ' ve been listening closely to concerns of europeans from all walks of life – and two clear messages emerge : first, many of our citizens are deeply worried about the future of our planet and the impact of the climate crisis on their daily lives. they have valid questions. will my children and grandchildren be able to live on a planet with rising sea levels ? how will we deal with more frequent and extreme weather events ? second, it sounds like a contradiction but at best it ' s a paradox : they ' re worried about the cost of living and climate policies, and how they will affect their lives and businesses. will i be able to pay my bills at the end of the month ? will my business grow in a rapidly changing economy with ever increasing demands ? that is why, for this commission, and for me, as the one responsible for climate, net zero and clean growth, we clearly need to bridge and to marry these two areas. we urgently need to address the climate crisis, make europe climate resilient and better prepared for climate risks. we also urgently need to unlock new markets, new opportunities, and new sources of growth. in my view, and i said it many times before, it ' s not a question of either / or. we can – and should – do both. the eu has always led the charge on climate change. we have to make sure we continue to do so. but we must harness the momentum"", 'reference': '7',

forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. the european green deal sets out a clear path towards realising the eu ' s ambitious target of a 55 % reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate neutral continent by 2050. the july 2021 package in support of the eu ' s climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the eu ' s reputation as a global climate leader. as part of these efforts, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring wto compatibility. climate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. as we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non eu countries, there is a strong risk of so called ‘ carbon leakage ' – i. e. companies based in the eu could move carbon intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or eu products could be replaced by more carbon intensive imports. such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of europe and therefore seriously undermine eu and global climate efforts. the cbam will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies. what is the carbon border adjustment mechanism ? designed in compliance with world trade organization (wto) rules and other international obligations of the eu, the cbam system will work as follows : eu importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the eu ' s carbon pricing rules. conversely, once a non eu producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the eu importer. the cbam will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non eu countries to green their production processes. carbon border adjustment mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as california, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. a number of countries such as canada and japan are planning similar initiatives. in addition, the imf and the oecd have recently carried out work to study how such measures could support"", 'reference':
