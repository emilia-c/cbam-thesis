reconciling international subsidy rules with industrial decarbonisation environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to netzero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra) national industrial decarbonisation efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie antiforeign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonisation at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the crossborder negative economic impacts of otherwise netglobalwelfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net globalwelfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, the world trade organisation \' s trade and environment committee and wto trade and environmental sustainability structured discussions, and the coalition of trade ministers on climate. the author thanks ronald steenblik, jeromin zettelmeyer,

that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the netzero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluterpays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition

carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is the first instrument of its kind and is already set to become the testing ground for future border carbon adjustments (bcas) all over the world. accordingly, many discussions have been raised on the implementation of the cbam, including what would be the best way to allocate the revenues raised thanks to the mechanism. energy intensive industries within europe have called for these revenues to be clearly allocated domestically to accelerate the development of lowcarbon technologies and decarbonise energy intensive sectors.

18 may a communication on business taxation for the 21st century to promote a robust, efficient and fair business tax system in the european union. advertisement why has the european commission adopted a communication on business taxation for the 21st century ? the eu needs a robust, efficient and fair business tax framework that supports the post covid19 recovery, removes obstacles to crossborder investment in the single market and creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a longterm vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in the longterm, today \' s communication presents a plan for a new framework for business taxation in the eu, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax obstacles and foster a more businessfriendly environment in the single market. the "" business in europe : framework for income taxation "" (or befi',
