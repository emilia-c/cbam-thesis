countries is necessary also because the system imposes several kinds of costs on third countries, such as ; the price that should be paid for greenhouse gas emissions, the costs of the considerable administrative work required for compliance (calculation of emissions, reporting, verification), losses of export revenue when goods is rendered uncompetitive, costs of necessary investments to regain competitiveness. countries and producers with the ability to shoulder costs for reducing their emissions should do so and can rightly be penalised if they fail to meet requirements. the same does not

their ways. a regional solution leveraged through an unfair head start, however, might cause progress to falter where it is most needed in the global fight against climate change. carbon leakage has hung over the eu ' s emissions trading scheme (ets) since its inception in 2005. cembureau, the european cement association, reported a 300 % five year increase in third country cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92m worth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given that the mechanism clearly conformed to world trade organisation (wto) rules : free allocations were always expected to phase out in a mirror image of the cbam phase in. the proposal eventually adopted on 22 june 2022 set the end date for both as 2032. in 2020, the eu imported us $ 383m worth of

endeavours to maintain its leadership role in global action against climate change. however, if measures are unilateral, europe risks having a limited impact on global reductions in ghg emission, while damaging the competitiveness of its domestic industrial base. the introduction of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) by the european commission is aimed at preventing the risk of carbon leakage and supporting the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation. the objective of this mechanism is to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports while ensuring that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less stringent policies. nitrogen fertilizer producers are among sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage due to the industry ' s emission intensity and exposure to international trade. the european fertilizer industry therefore welcomed the european commission ' s initiative to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism., but, since the beginning, underlined that for the fertilizer sector cbam would only work if eu ets free allocations at full benchmark level were maintained at least till 2030 and if cbam would also foresee a solution for the export part of the production. a well designed cbam could be particularly important for the sector since already today the main european fertilizer products have a climate footprint that is typically half of the global average. an effective and well designed cbam should aim at avoiding the replacement of ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers produced in europe with imports from countries with a worse carbon footprint while at the same time allowing the transformation of the industry toward a zero carbon production. fertilizers europe is therefore advocating for the cbam designed as a reinforcement of current carbon leakage measures with the stepped up climate ambition. why do we need an equal treatment between the ets and cbam sectors achieving a higher level of emission reduction ambition, requires mechanisms to strenghten carbon leakage protection and minimise negative impact on exports. complementarity of cbam with free allocation is key to protect value chains, mitigate the impact on trade flows and provide certainties for low carbon investments. cbam, and the current system of ets free allocations, should aim to effectively support the industry in meeting the increased climate targets. a higher level of climate ambition should correspond to a higher level of carbon leakage

adjustment mechanism 1. vdb as representative of the biofuel producers in germany the association of the german biofuel industry (verband der deutschen bio-kraftstoffindustrie e. v.-vdb) represents the interests of 15 biofuel producers in germany with a production capacity of 2. 3 million tons of biodiesel (and 600 gwh of biomethane). this equals approximately 60 % of the total biodiesel ca-pacity in germany in the transport sector. 2. remarks on the initiative the paris agreement has strengthened international climate cooperation by fostering a bottom up process : within this framework, countries and regions contribute to the common global goal of holding the increase in the global aver-age temperature to well below 2 c above pre industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1. 5 c. however, such an approach may be undermined by carbon leakage, i. e. the dis-placement of emissions from states with more to less stringent climate policy constraints. regarding the european union, the establishment of border carbon adjustments (bcas) offers a promising response. bcas represent a functional policy option to alleviate the risk of carbon leakage, which can occur whenever only a subset of jurisdictions implements serious climate action. carbon leakage matters, because it threatens to hurt the economy of countries with ambitious climate legislation and at the same time could undermine aggregate emission reductions and the effectiveness of collective climate action. bcas can help sus-tain and increase domestic climate protection ambition while also incentivizing foreign countries to take comparable action, and thereby supporting the goals of the paris agreement. bcas can be an effective instrument to level the playing field among competing producers. in this respect, it seems necessary to design and introduce bcas in an inclusive and transparent way from the outset. association of the german biofuel industry verband der

playing field in the eu. however, this is not enough for firms exporting out of the eu. hence, the issue of global competitiveness must be taken seriously. free allowances has been a useful instrument to mitigate the cost burden for firms in the ets. it should therefore be explored if, and if so how, the free allowances can co exist with cbam. if free allowances are replaced by cbam this will drive up costs for the affected sectors. furthermore, cbam can also lead to more expensive inputs for industries downstream. this would harm eu export competitiveness on third markets and make it harder for

however, since the eu has introduced climate measures that are significantly more ambitious than the rest of the world, we risk carbon leakage and put jobs and production in europe in jeopardy. hence, progressively more ambitious eu climate action requires efforts aimed at mitigating the competitiveness effects for european industry at risk. we realize the complexity of designing measures to this effect and we are looking forward to being a constructive partner in the policy dialogue. in principle, we support measures, including a well designed carbon border adjustment mechanism, to address the risk of carbon leakage. any such mechanism, however, must be designed with the overall objective to contribute as much as possible to reducing co2 emissions in a way that is administratively manageable and causes as little trade friction as possible. in particular this means : any mechanism will have to be wto compatible and should not be protectionist in design or purpose. it must be transparent, proportional and non discriminatory. this will in turn reduce the risk for trade retaliation. if the mechanism gradually replaces the current system of free allowances, the eu export competitiveness to third markets must be addressed. the mechanism should apply both to direct and indirect emissions from electricity use, as the latter is an increasing part of the production costs. the revenue collected should be used to fight climate change. this will strengthen the climate profile of the mechanism and further reduce the risk of trade retaliation from third countries. the mechanism should initially be limited in scope and could then gradually be expanded to more sectors where the carbon content is reasonably easy to estimate. increasing costs of raw materials and

with the eu bloc on mechanisms to comply with the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). cbam is a regulatory framework that imposes a carbon tariff on imports to the eu. he eu has decided to impose a carbon tax known as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), effective from january 1,2026, on the import of 7 carbon intensive sectors including : steel products iron and iron ore concentrates cement aluminum products fertiliser hydrogen electrical energy. most consider cbam as "" discriminatory "" and a "" trade barrier "" that would hit not only indian exports but also those of many other developing nations. the tariff is as high as 20-35 % on imports of these high carbon goods. to fully decarbonise their electricity use and remain competitive in the global market, india

provided that (a) its main objective is to encourage non eu producers to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, (b) eu carbon leakage avoidance schemes (mainly, free allowances) are not weakened, and (c) wto compatibility is ensured by keeping the system non discriminatory towards non eu exporters, as close to ets as possible, with solid reliance on gatt article xx where required. grupa azoty also believes that the fertilizer sector should be covered by the cbam for the following reasons : 1. eu fertilizer producers have already made significant contribution to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions, by practically eliminating n2o emissions and approaching technological limits for co2 process emissions from ammonia. 2. our sector has clearly paid the price for ets by suffering carbon leakage : exports are down, imports are up, eu companies are taken over by non eu producers from countries with no carbon pricing, investment in eu production is down with most new investments made outside of the european union (some of which are planned for exports to the eu). 3. main competitors of the eu fertilizer industry come from countries that have no price on carbon emissions. 4. eu market is attractive for non eu producers of fertilizers, hence introduction of cbam will encourage 3rd country producers to limit their own emissions. 5. it is simple to calculate emissions in the fertilizer sector, because they occur in only two points of production and most of emissions are directly related to consumption of key raw material. 6. most imports to the eu in our sector originate in a handful of countries, with a small number of producing exporters, making cbam manageable at the border. grupa azoty also welcomes the commission ' s decision to carry out a full impact assessment

environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a long term vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a

international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalization have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating cross border in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, start ups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade cross border. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission

targets, the industry will have to make fundamental changes to its production processes. two possible solutions immediately come to mind : capturing the co2 produced by traditional steel plants and repurposing it or storing it underground, or closing existing plants and building new ones that operate initially on natural gas and eventually on green hydrogen. the industry has considered such changes for years, and a few companies are piloting production of low carbon, hydrogen based steel in small volumes. beyond that, however, little progress has been made, primarily because the two possible solutions are enormously expensive and would hike the price of steel by as much as 50 %. that may seem unpalatable in a commodity industry with extremely low margins to begin with. but the alternative will be increasingly costly as well. approved or anticipated global regulatory changes aimed at reaching carbon neutrality in the next 30 to 40 years will translate into ever mounting carbon costs for steel companies that continue to use traditional processes. europe is leading the way in regulatory reform, targeting a 55 % reduction in carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, primarily through so called market based measures, which require steel producers to pay for each metric ton of co2 emitted. in addition, the eu will soon introduce the innovative carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), essentially a tariff on steel imports based on the amount of carbon embedded in them. simultaneously, chinaby far the largest steel producing countryis seeking carbon neutrality by 2060 and is also in the process of introducing a national carbon pricing system. the first emissions trading started in 2021 in the power sector and is expected to expand to include the

decision makers titled "" four guiding principles for cbam design and implementation "". the details of the recent agreements require further scrutiny, in light of previous recommendations. scope under the final agreement, the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) covers not only iron and steel, electricity, aluminum, cement, fertilisers (as in the commission \' s proposal), but also hydrogen, some precursors, and downstream products. it also provides for the possibility of including indirect emissions and sets the objective of having all emissions trading system goods covered by 2030. the proposed mechanism brings significant progress in making eu producers pay for their emissions while ensuring a level playing field with their foreign competitors. however, it also leaves many questions unanswered and defers crucial decisions to a later date. while an extension of cbam may help preserve the competitiveness of eu industries, it should remain limited to what is necessary to avoid carbon leakage, and not turn into a protectionist measure. schedule the gtn previously called for rapid implementation of the cbam, parallel to the phasing out of free allowances. the agreement is only partially in line with this recommendation. the introduction of the cbam mirrors the withdrawal of free allocations, avoiding double protection to the eu industries and strengthening the cbam as an environmental measure, and mitigating the risks associated with potential wto disputes. however, the agreed timeline may fall short of the ambitions set by the paris agreement. in its current version, cbam will start in 2026, and will not be fully phased in until 2034. the first years of the transition will bring little progress : 2. 5 % (2026), 5 % (2027), 10 % (2028). this measure only gives limited incentive for emitters to transition for several more years. export solutions in march 2022, the gtn called for "" a cautious approach to the question of protection for eu

climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 %

emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought within the scope of the mechanism should be granted a sufficiently long transition period now

to its potential to infringe on the principles of non discrimination and most favored nation treatment upheld by the world trade organization (wto). what is it, and how does it work ? the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is an initiative proposed by the european union (eu) to put a price on the carbon emitted while producing carbon intensive goods that enter the eu from countries lacking comparable carbon pricing systems. in principle, the goal of the cbam is to level the playing field for companies and discourage shifting emissions to countries with less stringent climate policies. however, since its inception, the cbam has been criticized by different global players, as they argue that the mechanism could violate wto rules, increase the cost of goods for consumers, and disproportionately affect developing countries. difficulties meeting deadlines as the details of its implementation start to emerge, the mandatory reporting deadline draws closer. effective october 1, the obligated party, meaning the importer, must submit information related to each quarter one month behind schedule. in addition to data relating to specific \' product \'-related co2 emissions (classified by tariff code), the information required includes the percentage of waste byproducts, the chemical composition of the steel, and any co2 emissions charges that may have been

european energy policy agenda as the limits of electrification became clear alongside the need to find a solution for the decarbonization of hard to abate sectors. as europe prepares to roll out legislation aimed at accelerating the production of hydrogen, hydrogen for europe charts two potential pathways "" technology diversity "" and "" renewable push "" with an in depth look at their

policy choices. it finds that the contribution of hydrogen to decarbonizing the eu \' s energy system can well exceed eu projections, with demand potentially exceeding 100 million tonnes of h2 by 2050. it also stressed the essential role played by low carbon hydrogen (which can be produced from natural gas in combination with ccs, or methane pyrolysis) can play in supporting the deployment of renewable hydrogen and the integration of higher volumes of renewable energy overall. in both scenarios, renewable hydrogen production scales up rapidly after 2030. however, a more diverse technology

european energy policy agenda as the limits of electrification became clear alongside the need to find a solution for the decarbonization of hard to abate sectors. as europe prepares to roll out legislation aimed at accelerating the production of hydrogen, hydrogen for europe charts two potential pathways "" technology diversity "" and "" renewable push "" with an in depth look at their implications, based on actual european targets and transparent modelling frameworks. the research project looks at the technology mix, cost of the transition, and risks associated with different policy choices. it finds that the contribution of hydrogen to decarbonizing the eu \' s energy system can well exceed eu projections, with demand potentially exceeding 100 million tonnes of h2 by 2050. it also stressed the essential role played by low carbon hydrogen (which can be produced from natural gas in combination with ccs, or methane pyrolysis) can play in supporting the deployment of renewable hydrogen and the integration of higher volumes of renewable energy overall. in both scenarios, renewable hydrogen production scales up rapidly after 2030. however, a more diverse technology mix enables a lower cost (1 trillion less from now until 2050) and a more effective pathway to eu climate neutrality by 2050. the study was conducted by research partners ifp nergies nouvelles

"" there is no point in only reducing greenhouse gas emissions at home if we increase the import of co2 from abroad. it is not only a climate issue ; it is also an issue of fairness, "" she told the davos world economic forum in january. the proposal for a carbon border tax is part of the eu \' s larger goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and was identified in december \' s european green deal as a way to catalyse this transition, alongside reforms to the taxation of energy products. carbon emissions are already priced within the eu through the eu emissions trading system (ets), which is levied on high emitting industries at around 25 per tonne. since foreign companies do not have to pay it, their products may enjoy a competitive advantage, which increases the risk of so called carbon leakage, where the manufacture of products such as electricity, steel and cement are outsourced to other countries with less ambitious emissions reduction policies. carbon leakage occurs when companies move their production from one place, usually a country with emissions reduction policies, to another with laxer policies. this is done to avoid the costs associated with the stricter policies. the greenhouse gas emissions (carbon) that the company produces are simply emitted in another country (leakage), thereby failing to reduce emissions overall. such leakage is seen as a threat to jobs and investment in eu countries, and undermines climate policies. a carbon border tax would make imports pay the same carbon price as domestic products to reflect their impact on the climate. it would also incentivise other countries to forge stronger climate policies because those levying their own carbon price domestically would be exempt. the idea has gained momentum as part of the solution to the economic crisis caused by the covid 19 pandemic. the european commission \' s recovery plan suggested it as an option to contribute to financing the future eu budget. depending on the scope and design, a carbon border "" adjustment mechanism "" could bring additional revenues of between 5 and 14 billion euros, it said. on 23 july, the commission launched a consultation on plans for', 'reference': '105', 'full_answer': 'carbon emissions are already priced within the eu through the eu emissions trading system (ets), which is levied on high emitting industries at around 25 per tonne.', 'sentence_beginning': ' ', 'sentence_end': ' through the eu emissions trading system (ets), which is levied on high emitting industries at around 25 per tonne.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': ': it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions', 'confidence': np.float32(0.0023150116), 'start': np.int64(271), 'end': np.int64(282), 'context': ""eu emission trading system (eu ets) what is the eu ets ? what is the cap and trade mechanism ? which gases and sectors are covered by it ? and how does it contribute to the eu green deal ? set up in 2005, the eu emissions trading system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in 2020 and is set to enforce a 62 % reduction by 2030. as part of the eu ' fit for 55 package ' the eu ets was revised to align it with the eu ' s overall objective of reducing net emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to"", 'reference': '990', 'full_answer': 'by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions.', 'sentence_beginning': ' by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.0}, {'answer': 'facto shift the cost of pollution from the actual polluters to the final consumer', 'confidence': np.float32(0.002078847), 'start': np.int64(215), 'end': np.int64(229), 'context': 'eu \' s \' fit for 55 \' is unfit and unfair the european commission is missing another historic opportunity to phase out fossil fuels in the \' fit for 55 \' package, leaving the door open for coal, gas and oil to stay in the eu energy system for at least another two decades while sending the "" polluter pays "" bill to eu citizens. the european commission will release on 14 july the latest instalment of the european green deal : \' fit for 55 \', details of which have been leaked to the press. this package is meant to align a wide range of eu policies with the eu \' s 55 % net emissions reduction target for 2030. the most relevant eu green policy dossier of the year not only fails to provide climate neutral roadmaps and sector specific targets, but also continues to shield eu industry from paying the full cost of pollution. introducing an emissions trading scheme for buildings and transport while maintaining free co2 allowances for industry and using public funds to finance fossil fuels in europe will de facto shift the cost of pollution from the actual polluters to the final consumer.

the eu emissions trading system (ets) works on the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing to emissions trading ?

as a key policy for cutting emissions from heavy industries, such as steel and cement production. by taxing carbon intensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbon pricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader

it targets industries that are typically emissions intensive and relatively easy to trade internationally, such as steel, aluminium and cement. cbams work on the basis that climate laws and standards in some nations usually those in the global north are tighter than those found elsewhere. this means that the producer of a particular emissions intensive product might have to pay a domestic carbon price, for example, whereas an overseas competitor might not. under a cbam, a nation that applies a carbon price to its domestic steel industry would apply an equivalent charge at the border, to steel

directive. this consultation focuses on the eu emissions trading system (eu ets), a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the eu ' s climate targets. the eu ets is a cap and

the extension of the eu ets to new sectors, such as the maritime sector, which is a sector that requires a basket of measures to ensure its fair contribution to the climate neutrality goal by 2050.

of final energy use and all 2050 carbon neutral scenario converge towards a multiplication by 2 to 3 to this share of electricity based on massive electrification of heat and transport based on low carbon power generation. this will require a significant transformation of the actual demand side with an active participation in energy efficiency, local low carbon generation and storage and the development of active flexible electricity demand. as far as carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is concerned :-risks of commercial retaliation (wto compliance) shall be carefully evaluated as well as consequences on final prices to european businesses and consumers-compliance with wto shall be a prerequisite and the impact assessment shall make a deep evaluation of this.-competitive advantage of a powerful domestic low carbon market ; will certainly bring add value to the eu industry. such parameter should be taken into account in the context of the work on cbam.-a possible alternative would be to support low carbon production of products in industry, by introducing incentives for reducing embedded carbon in production with emission benchmarks for low carbon alternatives (e. g. recycling steel, etc.). as far as energy taxation directive is concerned-today, in europe, taxation and levies are far higher on electricity than on gas and this hamper electrification development specifically for heating. on top of this, the current etd is looking at electricity tax irrespective of its source.-energy taxation directive and the per unit energy tax widely implemented in the european member states do not provide consumers with financial incentives for demand flexibility.-a specific attention on electricity used for ev charging is needed in order to avoid burdening of ev operation cost and smart charging and use of ev in demand flexibility shall be encouraged possibly with lower taxation and levies-we"", 'reference': '1678', 'full_answer': 'achieving climate

the principle of \' cap and trade \'. it sets an absolute limit or \' cap \' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. this cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. since the eu ets was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42. 8 % in the main sectors covered : power and heat generation and energy intensive industrial installations. as a market based system, the ets ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. as a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector. under the eu ets, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. at the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. if a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the "" saved "" allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. a market stability reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it. the sectors covered by the existing eu ets include power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within europe. the commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price. 2. what reforms are you proposing

'. while the european flat glass sector takes it as its role to produce at a competitive price the materials essential for renovating europe ' s buildings, for supporting the clean mobility transition and for increasing the share of renewable solar energy in europe, it aims to do so while reducing its use of resources and cutting co2 emissions from its own manufacturing activities. this journey

to its potential to infringe on the principles of non discrimination and most favored nation treatment upheld by the world trade organization (wto). what is it, and how does it work ? the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) is an initiative proposed by the european union (eu) to put a price on the carbon emitted while producing carbon intensive goods that enter the eu from countries lacking comparable carbon pricing systems. in principle, the goal of the cbam is to level the playing field for companies and discourage shifting emissions to countries with less stringent climate policies. however, since its inception, the cbam has been criticized by different global players, as they argue that the mechanism could violate wto rules, increase the cost of goods for consumers, and disproportionately affect developing countries. difficulties meeting deadlines as the details of its implementation start to emerge, the mandatory reporting deadline draws closer. effective october 1, the obligated party, meaning the importer, must submit information related to each quarter one month behind schedule. in addition to data relating to specific \' product \'-related co2 emissions (classified by tariff code), the information required includes the percentage of waste byproducts, the chemical composition of the steel, and any co2 emissions charges that may have been incurred in the country of origin. given these considerations, alacero, the regional entity representing the iron and steel industry, recently issued a statement expressing the concerns of its members

one occurrence influencing a much larger complex system. products which are manufactured abroad and imported into the eu will have an unfair competitive advantage over european manufactured products

finished products that are manufactured with the same raw materials covered by cbam and therefore become less competitive when manufactured in the eu, than equivalent goods manufactured outside of the

supplied in the eu (subject to the eu ets) or imported from elsewhere (subject to cbam). however, the same washing machine manufactured outside of europe will not be subject neither to the eu ets, nor

manufacturing costs to produce one single washing machine. the same cost increase will not be faced by the same manufacturer, with a factory located outside of the eu. as a result, european consumers will be incentivised to purchase cheaper imported goods to which no equivalent carbon pricing is applied, rather than eu made goods at a higher price. if corporate investments are diverted away to non

target of at least 55 % in 2030 (compared to 1990). building on the existing 2030 legislation and the communication on stepping up the eu ' s 2030 climate ambition, the commission will review and

the commission in december 2019, has tackling climate change and reaching the objectives of the paris agreement and other environmental issues (including addressing air pollution) at its core. the 2050 climate neutrality objective, which the commission proposed in 2018 and the european council and parliament endorsed, is one of its central elements. the commission has proposed to enshrine climate neutrality into eu law. in order to set the eu on a sustainable path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the commission has proposed in the communication on stepping up the eu ' s 2030 climate ambition an eu wide, economy wide net greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 55 % in 2030 (compared to 1990). building on the existing 2030 legislation and the communication on stepping up the eu ' s 2030 climate ambition, the commission will review and propose to revise, where necessary, the key relevant legislation by june 2021. this will include a coherent set of changes to, notably, the eu emissions trading system directive, the effort sharing regulation and the land use, land use change and forestry (lulucf) regulation, co2 emissions performance standards for cars and vans and, the renewable energy directive and the energy efficiency directive. this consultation focuses on the eu emissions trading system (eu ets), a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the eu ' s climate targets. the eu ets is a cap and trade system that currently governs 41 % of the eu ' s emissions, covering power and heat generation, energy intensive industrial sectors and aviation within the european economic area and to / from switzerland. the communication on stepping up the eu ' s 2030 climate ambition explicitly indicates the need to revise the eu ets in light of the aforementioned more ambitious target. this includes the extension of the eu ets to new sectors, such as the maritime sector, which is a sector that requires a basket of measures to ensure its fair contribution to the climate neutrality goal by 2050. furthermore, emissions trading system could be expanded to road transport and buildings, and potentially all fossil

european commission is aimed at preventing the risk of carbon leakage and supporting the eu ' s increased ambition on climate mitigation. the objective of this mechanism is to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports while ensuring that the eu ' s climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less stringent policies. nitrogen fertilizer producers are among sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage due to the industry ' s emission intensity and exposure to international trade. the european fertilizer industry therefore welcomed the european commission ' s initiative to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism., but, since the beginning, underlined that for the fertilizer sector cbam would only work if eu ets free allocations at full benchmark level were maintained at least till 2030 and if cbam would also foresee a solution for the export part of the production. a well designed cbam could be particularly important for the sector since already today the main european fertilizer products have a climate footprint that is typically half of the global average. an effective and well designed cbam should aim at avoiding the replacement of ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers produced in europe with imports from countries with a worse carbon footprint while at the same time allowing the transformation of the industry toward a zero carbon production. fertilizers europe is therefore advocating for the cbam designed as a reinforcement of current carbon leakage measures with the stepped up climate

that is short of allowances. buildings account for 40 % of the total energy consumed and for 36 % of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. for this reason, the commission is proposing the extension of the ets to buildings as well as transport in order to significantly reduce emissions over time. the new obligations from the extension of the ets to buildings will regulate fuel suppliers, rather than households. the suppliers will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the quantity of fuels they place on the market and for surrendering emission allowances each calendar year depending on the carbon intensity of the fuels. the new system will become operational as of 2025, with a cap on emissions set from 2026, based on data collected under the effort sharing regulation. during the first year, fuel suppliers will be required to hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit and to report their emissions for 2024 and 2025. introduction of cbam the carbon border adjustment mechanism

adjustment mechanism (cbam) subject overview in 2018, ursula von der leyen outlined the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism as part of the green deal, which would apply a tariff or tax on products based on their greenhouse gas emissions. reporting requirements for products valued at over 150 euros under this mechanism were set to begin on october 1,2023. starting from 2026, there will also be an obligation to acquire cbam certificates to offset the emissions from the production of a product. the obligation to acquire cbam certificates will increase gradually between 2026 and 2035. the price of cbam certificates will follow the price of eu emissions trading allowances. as of the 2023 cbam decision, products from the chemical industry, including fertilizers (including ammonia) and hydrogen, fall under the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism. the current interpretation suggests that the mechanism overlaps with the carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system. consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam certificates increases. the practical implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism appears to pose technical challenges. this topic has also raised concerns from countries outside the eu, with the risk of the situation escalating into a trade dispute. if the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is successful, it has the potential to protect the eu ' s internal market. however, the loss of free emission allowances (and possible compensation) will negate this benefit for some companies. the carbon border adjustment mechanism does not protect exports, so it seems to be detrimental to industries covered by emissions trading carbon leakage protection. objective of the chemical industry the chemical industry approaches the carbon border adjustment mechanism and its potential expansion with caution. the industry believes that the existing carbon leakage protection of the eu emissions trading system should be maintained primarily and strengthened. the eu ' s carbon border adjustment mechanism should be kept as narrow as possible, and any potential expansion should be carried out in consultation with the industry affected by the expansion. the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not affect the cost competitiveness of export industries. since the mechanism does not protect exports outside the eu, other carbon leakage protections should continue for relevant production. additionally, the carbon border adjustment mechanism should not be applied to intermediate products in the value chains of chemical industry products. in principle, industries brought within the scope of the mechanism should be granted a sufficiently long transition period now"", 'reference': '1412', 'full_answer': 'consequently, the allocation of free emission allowances will decrease as the obligation to acquire cbam

the european cement association, reported a 300 % five year increase in third country cement imports up to 2021, with spikes matching those in ets credit prices. companies from turkey to australia have produced and transported their cement into the eu, at great co2 cost, while benefitting from a competitive edge over domestic producers, it would seem. lawmakers rectified the situation by maintaining free allocations of ets credits to eu industries, including cement, which received us $ 92m worth in 2021. 1 in the wake of the paris agreement, an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated the proposal. most interesting was the international response : brazil, china, india and south africa voiced ' grave concern ' over the proposed cbam. a russian representative at the department of european cooperation lamented the possible necessity of ' response measures, ' while us climate envoy john kerry coolly urged the eu to wait until after the cop26 climate change conference in november 2021. the outbursts were surprising given

governance meeting the temperature objectives under the paris agreement will require disruptive system innovations in all sectors of the global economy. to make the required transition a success, we

neutrality objectives in a smart and cost effective way, and to reap the many opportunities of a transition to a climate neutral society. the eu is not only a major current and historical emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also in a unique position to shape climate action beyond its own borders. acting together, eu member states have the financial resources, market presence and diplomatic sway to bring other global players along with them in pursuing greater climate ambition. we believe that recent climate neutrality commitments from japan, china and south korea were strongly influenced by the eu ' s efforts. to continue to lead by example, the eu and member states must do more to strengthen their governance frameworks to ensure the level of ambition and policy framework to deliver

clarity, operational coherence, and alignment with established frameworks. firstly, article 4 (2) introduces ambiguity by implying that both the competent authority and other entities may be responsible for communicating decisions on penalties. this phrasing conflicts with article 26 (4) of the cbam regulation (eu) 2023 / 956, which assigns this responsibility solely to the competent authority. to address this, we recommend amending article 4 (2) to clarify that only the competent authority is responsible for communicating penalty decisions. secondly, article 10, which governs the cbam operators portal, requires several clarifications : 1. the article does not explicitly state that the portal applies to operators of installations in third countries, potentially leading to confusion. to resolve this, the text should clearly specify its scope. 2. the phrasing of article 10 (2) (b) allows for potential misinterpretation that operators can register information on goods from installations other than their own. we suggest revising this to specify information on the goods produced by its installation. 3. the draft does not indicate whether the use of the portal is voluntary, leaving operators uncertain about compliance requirements. we recommend explicitly stating that the portals use is voluntary, ensuring flexibility. next, article 16 refers to a business continuity plan to address temporary registry failures but provides no details or definitions. this omission leaves stakeholders uninformed about its content or application. to enhance transparency, the legal text should either define the term or outline its components. furthermore, article 21 on the confidentiality of data within the cbam registry raises concerns about transparency and consistency with the eu ets framework. the cbam framework designates most registry information as confidential, restricting public access to key data and undermining accountability. in contrast, the ets registry, referencing directive 2003 / 4 / ec on public access to environmental information, provides transparency through publicly available data on installations, emissions, and free allocations. the cbam regulation itself (article 1 (2)) emphasises the need for equivalence with ets rules. to align with these principles, we recommend : 1. clearly defining personal data and

heavy carbon emitters, while in the early stages and likely to face challenges, represent new initiatives to address climate change-- the use of established trade mechanisms. these efforts have attracted the attention of countries such as china and russia that could be affected considerably by such adjustments. mechanisms such as the eu ' s ' cap and trade ' emissions trading scheme (ets) have been in place for many years. the eu and the united states now are considering new proposals generally known as carbon border taxes or border adjustments-- levies on imports based on the amount of carbon emissions resulting from production of the product in question. these measures, at least in the case of the eu proposal, are aimed in part at reducing ' carbon leakage '-- the relocation by businesses from countries that have enacted measures to reduce carbon emissions to other countries with looser standards. they also are a means of incentivizing / penalizing countries deemed to be insufficiently addressing the issue of climate change. the european commission, as part of its ' fit for 55 ' package (named for the goal of reducing eu greenhouse gas emissions by 55 % by 2030 compared with 1990 levels), has proposed a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). the proposed cbam would be a levy on the importation of certain specified goods (cement, electricity, fertilizers, iron and steel, and aluminum) into the eu. for additional discussion of the cbam and the other proposed eu measures, see pw c tax policy alert, european commission releases a number of ' green

\' s budget in order to meet increasing spending demands, not least repayment of debt incurred as part of the eu \' s post pandemic economic recovery. in particular it is seen as desirable that the eu should have \' own \' resources, or reliable ongoing revenue streams. but there is little agreement on what new own resources could consist of. limited reform so far has led to the introduction of a levy paid by eu members depending on plastic packaging waste generated in their territory and not recycled. meanwhile, the european commission has proposed resources for the eu budget from emissions trading revenues, and from levies collected under the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam). there proposals are pragmatic and move in the right direction, but do not go far enough. the debate about own resources should focus on whether the eu will be able to build genuine own resources based on common tax policies. the eu suffers from \' tax leakage \' in which profits are shifted from high tax to low tax eu countries, and from there onto no or low tax non eu jurisdictions, often without the application of withholding taxes. it may not be too much ofa stretch to compare this situation of tax leakage with the situation addressed by cbam-a quasi tax at the border. so far, an opportunity for what could be seen as a tax at the border of the internal market, aiming to protect the market from harmful competition, may have been missed. such a tax could reflect the undertaxed profit rule agreed as part of the international deal on the corporate minimum tax. focusing on protecting the revenues of eu members by common tax borders could offer scope for new own resources. bruegel recommended citation saint amans, p.

an emissions pricing mechanism on cement imports first came before a vote of the member states in february 2017. in what would become a recurring theme, opposition from all sides of the issue defeated

system (eu ets) is the cornerstone of the european climate policy, covering about 36 % of total eu ghg emissions in 2022 (european commission, 2023). while the eu ets was the first large emissions trading scheme in the world, many more countries have been adopting etss in the past years. as of the beginning of 2023, there are 28 operational emissions trading systems around the world (icap, 2023). the eu ets follows the ' polluters pay principle ', whereby firms covered by the ets need to purchase an emissions allowance for each tonne of co2 eq they inject into the atmosphere. in this respect, the eu ets is a carbon pricing mechanism, like a carbon tax. two main features distinguish an ets from a carbon tax. firstly, a carbon tax fixes the price for polluting but the amount of co2 eq abated by the measure is uncertain. by contrast, the eu ets follows the cap and trade approach : it sets an emissions cap, imposing an upper bound to emissions. the price of allowances is determined by the market and is thus variable. secondly, firms covered by the eu ets can trade allowances between themselves, so that less polluting firms requiring fewer allowances can sell them to more carbon intensive ones. as explained in more detail further below in this article, some of the firms participating in the eu ets also receive free allowances according to efficiency benchmarks which reward the most efficient installations. the emissions cap of the eu ets decreases at a yearly rate, called the linear reduction factor (lrf). the lrf is currently set at 2. 2 % of the 2010 baseline and will increase to 4. 3 % from 2024 to 2027 and to 4. 4 % from 2028. relatively to its launch in 2005, the eu ets achieved a 21 % reduction of regulated emissions in 2020 and is set to

efficacy, which supports the demands for transparency and confirmation of ethical practices within mining and steel manufacturing supply chains. the steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new

prevent possible violations. the law is intended to help improve and harmonise compliance with human rights and environmental standards worldwide. in this article, we show you what requirements the act places on your company and how new potential for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future can be tapped. since january 2023, all companies in germany with more than 3, employees have been obliged to comply with human rights and environmental standards throughout their entire supply chain. this means continuous monitoring of suppliers-all over the world, if in doubt. if a company recognises violations, it is now legally obliged to take measures to remedy the shortcomings. to ensure this continuous monitoring, companies must regularly report on their efforts to comply with human rights and environmental standards in their supply chains. these reports must be published. this ensures that an independent and, in case of doubt, public review can take place at any time. the implementation of the law is also monitored by the federal office of economics and export control. any infringements may result in fines and penalties. with these comprehensive monitoring options, the legislator wants to ensure that no companies can offer services or products in germany whose supply chain does not comply with minimum international human rights and environmental standards. supply chains have a significant impact on fair trade and the environment worldwide. therefore, a sustainable approach to supply chains is a decisive contribution to improving standards worldwide. treating suppliers fairly and paying fair prices for goods and services not only helps to improve working conditions in the producing countries, but also reduces the company ' s environmental footprint. in this way, fair business practices help to actively improve people ' s standard of living and implement more sustainable production on the global market. supply chains always function according to certain operating principles. if only profit is taken into account, there is a risk of exploitation, forced labor, child labor and inappropriate working conditions. monitoring supply chains, on the

with a focus on china. to shed light on these challenges and explore potential solutions for a coordinated and effective approach, suzan naz uzel, from revolve, interviewed yan qin, lead carbon analyst at the london stock exchange group (lseg). how can the eu ensure that the cbam is implemented fairly and equitably, considering its potential impact on the competitiveness of industries in various countries, especially those with significant carbon footprints ? one of the primary objectives of the cbam is to exert pressure on nations with insufficient climate policies and incentivize them to enhance their environmental efforts. in this era, "" greenness "" has become a key determinant of competitiveness, as products boasting lower carbon footprints gain a distinct advantage in the global market. this shift is underscored by the increasing adoption of net zero targets by various enterprises and jurisdictions. it is important to design the cbam in a fair manner. i think the final design of the cbam as agreed in the legislation process is quite balanced. it introduced a three year transition period so that other countries \' industries and policy makers could have some time to prepare. the cbam also takes into account the free allowances, so this is rather fair for exporters too. for instance, while 1 ton of steel production might emit approximately 2 tons of co2, the actual carbon costs per ton are not necessarily two multiplied by the price of european union allowances (eua) set at 100 euros.

sustainable future of europe ' s industry by dagmar dieterle the steel industry is facing a perfect storm : decarbonisation, competitive pressure, imports from outside eu and declining demand are presenting companies with immense challenges. tata steel nederland has set itself the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2045. in an interview with market steel, hans van den berg, ceo of tata steel nederland with its integrated site in ijmuiden in the netherlands, explains what political measures are needed at european level to support this transformation and why green innovations also depend on fair competition. market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? market steel : mr van den berg, tata steel nederland has set an ambitious goal with achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. what political frameworks are required to meet this objective ? the transformation to carbon neutrality is complex. for tata steel this means transforming our production process while still producing steel in the traditional way and also maintaining the high quality standards. furthermore, it is also a political challenge. the transformation of european industry means facilitating the transformation of companies in transition like tata steel nederland for example through financial measures and faster permitting processes. at the same time, the right (framework) conditions need to be established : ensuring the necessary sufficient clean energy production, competitive network cost and also creating a market for clean products like green steel. all in a european level playing field situation, also on (energy) taxation and exemptions. this happens in a challenging context, where the european steel industry is facing significant pressures due to competition from third countries especially our strategic rivals. market steel : what do you see as the biggest challenges to decarbonization, and how could european policymakers help to address them ? given the challenges faced by the entire european steel industry, the european commission needs to enact a steel action plan, aiming at solving the immediate issues faced by industry and facilitating the clean transformation of steel companies. market steel : green hydrogen is a key component of europe ' s decarbonization strategy. what specific steps should european policymakers take to promote the production and availability of green hydrogen in europe ? unfortunately, over the past four

greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. however, disparities in carbon pricing across regions posed challenges, including carbon leakagewhere companies relocate production to jurisdictions with less stringent climate policies. the european union spearheaded cbam ' s development as a solution to these challenges. initially proposed as part of the european green deal, cbam targeted key carbon intensive sectors like steel, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, hydrogen, and electricity. by attaching a carbon price equal to european emission allowances to imports from non eu countries, the mechanism sought to equalize the cost of carbon emissions between domestic producers and foreign competitors. cbam today current implementation status the eu began cbam ' s implementation in october 2023 with a transitional phase focused on reporting obligations. importers of covered goods must now provide data on embedded emissions, paving the way for full financial implementation in 2026. at first, only 2. 5 % of imported emissions will have to be covered with the cbam certificates but the percentage will gradually increase and reach 100 % by 2034. starting january 2025, the following updates to cbam regulations will take effect : mandatory use of eu emission calculation methodology : importers will be required to calculate embedded emissions using the eu ' s standardized methodology, replacing the flexibility of prior methods. this ensures greater consistency and accuracy across reported data. enhanced cbam registry features : the cbam registry will introduce a feature allowing non eu

changing before our eyes. we see dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape. this week alone, we saw a long standing strategic partner vote against a un resolution condemning russia ' s aggression

they also depend on maintaining and further developing our economic base by adapting, innovating, and competing in the world. in short, we need to build a more competitive europe. earlier today, my colleagues presented the clean industrial deal and an action plan to bring down energy prices as part of that effort. cutting red tape is another important element to achieve more competitive europe. put simply, we cannot hope or expect to successfully compete in a perilous world with one hand tied behind our backs. the past five years have been a period of intense regulatory activity. while our commitment to securing the green transition has not wavered, we must acknowledge that this has come at a cost, generating a large regulatory burden on people and businesses. as we take stock, we see that this accumulation of rules, and their increased complexity, are limiting our economic potential and our prosperity. today, regulation is seen by more than 60 % of eu companies as an obstacle to investment. 55 % of smes flagging regulatory obstacles and administrative burdens as their greatest challenge. in europe, small and medium sized enterprises (smes) constitute approximately 99 % of all businesses. they are most at risk of being suffocated by administrative burdens. they are europe ' s economic engine, for whom we are speaking and acting with today ' s proposals. i also want to be very clear that we remain deeply committed to building a greener and fairer society and economy. simplification is about making sure that eu rules help deliver rather than impede the achievement of our economic, social, environmental and security goals. it is about achieving those goals in a smarter and less burdensome way. less bureaucracy means more innovation and investment [ that will secure

industries, with a combined downturn of 4. 8 % across the metal technology, electrical engineering, electronics, and ict and mechanical engineering sectors. this is even worse than the already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and audi all reducing or

in 2025. what should chemical companies prepare for in the coming year ? let ' s explore the top developments that are shaping the industry landscape. the chemical sector will see ongoing consolidation through mergers, acquisitions, and portfolio restructuring. already, major players are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on emerging opportunities. in 2024, basf launched a separate catalyst business, basf environmental catalyst and metal solutions, to serve customers in the hydrogen economy. sudarshan chemicals acquired heubach in october 2024, diversifying

expect more consolidation for 2025. chemical companies are feeling the pressure of cost increases. feedstock and energy prices particularly remain a significant concern, with european gas prices still four times higher than in the u. s. capacity constraints, fluctuating demand, and geopolitical factors like new tariffs under the trump administration could also greatly impact profitability in chemical sectors. to navigate these challenges, companies must reevaluate their operations and seek innovative, cost effective solutions to sustain momentum. the industry is shifting toward regionalized or localized production to ensure supply chain resilience. nearshoring and friendshoring are becoming more of a priority as companies seek to mitigate geopolitical risks, cut costs, and reduce transportation emissions. this trend brings opportunities for chemical suppliers to develop strong regional partnerships and optimize their distribution networks. customers are prioritizing sustainability, traceability, and esg (environmental, social, and governance) factors in their purchasing decisions, causing chemical companies to adapt their product portfolios and manufacturing processes to meet these demands. while challenging, this shift creates opportunities for innovative solutions that address environmental concerns while ensuring consistent performance. the chemical

already pessimistic predictions made in our spring 2024 economics & statistics report. the decline can be attributed to a range of causes, including challenges related to regulatory burden and high energy costs. of the sectors we report on, the metal technology industry is faring slightly better, with a downturn of 3. 3 %. electrical engineering, electronics and ict saw a 5. 4 % drop and mechanical engineering suffered a 5. 3 % decrease in turnover. the anticipated recovery in demand, driven by lower interest rates, failed to materialise, exacerbating the downturn. employment also took a hit, albeit a smaller one, with a 1 % decline overall. outlook for 2025 the outlook for 2025 remains bleak, with predictions of a further 0. 5 % contraction in real turnover. while there are some glimmers of optimism in smaller eu economies, the overall sentiment is weighed down by the pessimism from larger manufacturing economies in central europe. the automotive sector continues to struggle with weak demand, particularly for electric vehicles, which is affecting the entire supply chain microchips, engines, batteries, electric chargers, and so on. a lack of competitiveness in europe, caused in part by high energy prices, excessive regulation and rising labor costs, is contributing to further negative predictions in 2025. despite a decrease, energy costs remain higher than pre 2022 levels and, importantly, higher than those of competitors. employment is predicted to shrink by 0. 9 % in 2025, with metal technology and mechanical engineering seeing the biggest losses at 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % and electrical engineering, electronics and ict staying stable with a growth of 0. 1 %. there could be dramatic job losses in the automotive sector with volkswagen, stellantis and

markets : a review of global initiatives and evolving models photo : ed jones / afp via getty images available downloads the issue the global voluntary carbon market, and its supporting industry ecosystem, has grown substantially from its origins in the early 1990s. despite this growth, voluntary markets have been hampered by reputational and functional concerns about offset quality and the space remains fragmented. with no long term regulatory obligations or pricing signals on carbon, firms are left to chart their net zero paths with little guidance or policy vision. the question is whether organized voluntary carbon markets can help resolve these challenges by creating credible incentives for emissions reductions. this brief reviews recent initiatives aimed at creating more functional, transparent, and effective carbon marketplaces. in many cases, there is a growing intersection between government and private sector activity in voluntary markets. these novel initiatives demonstrate how market design choices imply different goals for voluntary markets. these models suggest new ways for governments to support the legitimacy and success of voluntary markets. this brief considers how these market approaches could be best suited to support u. s. policy and trade strategies. note on terminology it is important to be clear on the terminology used in this brief. the phrase "" voluntary carbon market "" can be used in various ways. the first usage of the term refers to the global voluntary carbon market in its broadest conception. this is the noncentralized, fragmented, and emergent global industry ecosystem. private buyers and sellers exchange carbon credits that represent one ton of greenhouse gas avoided or removed, though the exact specification of these credits is likewise unregulated and non standardized. credits are generated by diverse types of projects globally and certified by a variety of independent organizations. buyers purchase credits to offset emissions and meet internally set voluntary goals or to sell forward to other end "" users "" of the credit. a second sense of the term, and the primary focus of this brief, concerns an emerging class of voluntary carbon markets that are demarcated from the global marketplace ; these are organized voluntary carbon market initiatives. these markets share many of the basic principles and in some cases share the same credits with the broader global market, but they represent attempts by commercial and governmental bodies to create regulated centralized marketplaces that cover their respective jurisdictions, industries, or interests. review of voluntary carbon markets to manage increasing demand for carbon credits, private firms and organizations have developed standards and

is responsible for around 7 % of global carbon emissions. this substantial carbon footprint prompts steelmakers to look for ways to cut their emissions. in january, arcelor mittal secured 850 million ($ 885 million) in subsidies from the french government to support its 1. 7 billion decarbonization program at its dunkirk and fos sur mer sites in france. a key component of this plan involves replacing 2 of 3 blast furnaces in dunkirk with green hydrogen powered facilities. despite the substantial funding, the company has yet to finalize these investments. arcelor mittal stated in an email : "" we are operating in a difficult market, and there are a number of policy uncertainties that are impacting the industry we need an effective carbon border adjustment mechanism, as well as more

breakthrough proved it ' s technologically possible to decarbonise the versatile alloy. hybrit, a consortium consisting of vattenfall, steel producer ssab and miner lkab, produced the first ever fossil fuel free steel using green hydrogen. hybrit ' s aspiration is not unique. driven by the steel zero initiative, set up in 2020 by the climate group to drive action to decarbonise the sector, key industry stakeholders have made a flurry of commitments and investments to reach this milestone by 2050. industry momentum is expected to continue in 2022 with the first industrial pilot projects expected by the middle of the decade. around 71 per cent of steel produced today comes from an iron ore based method. this typically uses a blast furnace at temperatures of around 1,500c in which carbon, usually coal, is used to remove oxygen and impurities from the ore to make pig iron. the latter is then turned into steel via a basic oxygen furnace whereby oxygen is blown onto the liquid iron to burn unwanted elements. the other 29 per cent is made using scrap and electric arc furnaces (eaf), which use an electrical current to melt scrap steel. this is on average 25 per cent less carbon intensive than the other method. steel producers are considering several ways to decarbonise these processes. at the hybrit pilot plant in lule, sweden, engineers opted to replace the blast furnace process with a ' direct reduction ' that uses hydrogen made from water and renewable electricity to reduce iron ore pellets manufactured by llkb without fossil fuels to sponge iron, which is then turned into steel. the temperature needed for the reduction process is much lower than in the blast furnace and produces only water vapor as a by product, removing 90 per cent of co2 emissions. the technique is powered by energy from the national grid, which in sweden is largely fossil free, consisting mostly of hydro and wind power. ssab hope to turn their research into a full scale pilot

stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and

environmental and social sustainability efficacy, which supports the demands for transparency and confirmation of ethical practices within mining and steel manufacturing supply chains. the steel industry is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. because of the complexities of these processes, the stakeholders at the two ends of the chain struggle to interact efficiently, creating barriers to communication and loss of information across the chain. in times when customers and regulators are requiring more and more transparency of information. the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of its supply chain and drive sustainability and esg agendas with blockchain technology. the steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world. it is an integrated process that begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials and ends with the manufacturing of products. it involves multiple stakeholders, including miners, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. the steel industry is facing several challenges in managing a sustainable supply chain. the complexity of the process and communication gaps between stakeholders can make it difficult to trace materials, products, and processes. this lack of traceability can lead to problems such as counterfeiting, illegal dumping, and environmental degradation. in addition, the increasing complexity of the global supply chain and the need to adhere to stringent regulations have made it difficult to manage the steel supply chain. the lack of visibility and traceability can lead to inefficiencies in the production process and undermine the quality of the products. blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and efficient data sharing between multiple stakeholders. companies can use blockchain technology to track the movement of materials and the end to end production process of steel products. additionally, using smart contracts for supplier communications and automated business rules validation, companies can take advantage of blockchain to create trust between stakeholders and make sure that transactions are secure and transparent. steel is one of the most common materials on earth, and it is widely used in construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. however, the process of mining, refining, and producing new steel can have a significant impact on the environment, leading to high carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. by recycling steel, we can reduce the amount of energy and raw materials required to produce new steel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint of the steel industry. by using a secure and transparent blockchain network, stakeholders in the steel recycling process can be connected and have real time visibility into the entire supply chain', 'reference': '817', 'full_answer': 'the steel industry can improve visibility and traceability of

materials provenance and emissions traceability for critical minerals sourcing with oracle blockchain platform. "" we bring transparency to complex supply chains across a broad range of industries. oracle blockchain platform is a critical component within our solutions that enable clients to transparently record and share the origins and material journeys of raw materials. this helps prevent unethically sourced minerals from being included in supply chains and helps upstream miners who invest in setting higher bars of sustainable and responsible production to get rewarded in the marketplace. "" business challenges the essential global shift to an electrified and digital future has placed unprecedented demand for critical minerals used in the production of a vast array of products, including solar panels, consumer electronics, and electric vehicles (ev). meanwhile, the complex geopolitical landscape, has motivated many organizations to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers and source these minerals closer to home or with allied countries. historically, acquisition of critical minerals has left a trail of human rights violations and environmental devastation. in addition, the related mining, refining, and manufacturing processes create significant ghg emissions concerns, which can only be addressed when there \' s transparency and data sharing from many supply chain participants. consequently, companies along these complex industrial supply chains are experiencing increased pressure from governments, consumers, and internal stakeholders to ensure ethical and
