with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week. and i must tell you, i am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new commission. today we approved in college the clean industrial deal. the clean industrial deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the antwerp declaration. your central demand was to make a clear business case for europe. and i am willing to do that. but before i address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in europe. europe has got talent. we produce one quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. that is more than both the us and china. europe has top class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. take for example the hydrogen sector. last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. that is the fastest growth worldwide. europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10 %, while the consumption of energy went up by 1 %. and yes, we are on track to achieve our 55 % emission reduction target for 2030. and this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments. at the same time, i know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. prime minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. we know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy intensive industries. the demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. so, we must turn the tide. and this is the central goal of the clean industrial deal. we want to cut the ties that still hold you back. so that europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production',

the 21st century. just like this palace blends old and new, europe has always been a union of tradition and innovation. today, as we drive clean growth, innovation, and a more sustainable future, this

need to address the climate crisis, make europe climate resilient and better prepared for climate risks. we also urgently need to unlock new markets, new opportunities, and new sources of growth. in

impacts, and we can only solve them together. or, to put it differently : in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots. that is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the paris agreement. as you may know, the goal of the paris agreement is to hold “ the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels ”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1. 5 degrees celsius. the reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us. last year, your

legislative package, which amends the existing climate and energy legislation. after intense negotiations, almost 2,000 amendments have been compiled in 30 compromise amendments. for the ecr group, there are numerous points of criticism in the detail. first of all, the report of the committee on environment increases the emissions reduction for ets sectors from 61 per cent in the commission proposal to as much as 67 per cent-the ecr cannot agree to anything above the commission proposal which is going to be difficult enough to achieve. the distribution of free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage is too rigid. the raising of the benchmark update rate will decrease the free allocation and the fact that the free allocation is to end as early as 2030 for cbam covered installations will hit some industrial sectors hard. we consider the free allocation of allowances to biomass plants to be erroneous, as we do not consider this to be environmentally friendly. we also consider it a failure that the envisaged modernisation fund has been cut, as well as the inclusion of waste incineration in the scope of the directive, which will probably create incentives for landfilling. another criticism is also that nuclear power is excluded from any ets funding, be it in the modernisation fund, innovation fund (here called climate investment fund) and in national revenues. nuclear power is a crucial energy source when it comes to being climate friendly and maintaining a stable energy supply. further problems arise in detailed regulations on market access or

system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. the president also said that the financing would come from the eu emission trading system in a direct reply to calls from businesses : “ you said : this money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. that is exactly what we are doing now. ” president von der leyen also talked about the important role that

more could be used. for example, she said that end of life batteries could provide 15 % of the lithium needed in europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles. that is why the

least 55 % emissions reductions compared to 1990. in the near term, approximately 800 billion of recovery and resilience facility (rrf) is europe ' s medium term answer to the covid 19 crisis and the centrepiece of the “ next generation eu ”, which is our eu ' s recovery fund ; 30 % of the approximately 2 trillion dollars of the eu budget for the next 7 years are to be earmarked for climate action. and 100 % of our budget should ‘ do no significant harm '. and should never go into another direction. a comprehensive legislative package will be proposed in june to meet this enhanced goal. in short, there are 12 proposals in the pipeline to bolster existing policies and regulations, strengthen targets and shift incentives towards sustainable practices in particular with regard to our emission cap and trade system, with regard to increasing our natural carbon sinks by protecting and restoring our forests, our forests are in a really bad shape, to our energy production in terms of more renewables, and differentiated energy taxation, and with regard to even higher emission standards for our cars and vans, and an extended charging infrastructure across the european continent.

climate science shows the urgency of action in this decade to meet the targets of the paris agreement. the impacts of the climate crisis are dramatically felt both in china and the eu and remind us of the responsibility to fully commit to emissions reductions while making our economies more resilient. they discussed the key issues at stake at cop28 including the global stocktake, decarbonisation of the energy systems, climate adaptation, climate finance and carbon pricing, and the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund. commissioner hoekstra highlighted the importance of ambition on emission reductions at cop28 via the outcome of the global stocktake. in particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030, to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels. they discussed at length what the end of coal and other fossil fuels means for industrial restructuring and how to make these efforts compatible with energy security concerns. on the issue of climate finance, the commissioner underlined that all parties able to contribute should do so in general, and in particular for the loss and damage fund. he also recalled the eu ' s role as the world ' s largest provider of international climate finance. commissioner hoekstra agreed to work closely together with special envoy xie ahead of and during cop28 to ensure a successful outcome for all parties. decades of continuous cooperation by the eu and china in the multilateral climate negotiations provide a strong foundation. commissioner hoekstra commended special envoy xie on china ' s massive increase in renewable energy capacity over recent years. beyond cop, he committed to continue close eu china cooperation on climate issues such as carbon pricing and the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam), measuring and reducing methane emissions, and

of the eu ' s economy. you play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value. and i know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the covid 19 pandemic and then russia ' s war against ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. to mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on european businesses, the commission put in

we ' ll look into recommendations on immediate expensing and accelerated depreciation to encourage business to invest in clean tech production. we ' ll also look into if and how we update the state aid framework to ensure it ' s fit for purpose. and we ' ll continue to work on current legislative proposals such as befit that will enhance eu competitiveness. we ' re also very much aware that high energy prices are a major challenge for businesses large and small across our union. to address this, we ' ll look into the role of levies, charges but also taxes. on top of that, it ' s clear that complexity and red tape – created at european level but also to the same degree at member states level – needs to be tackled. therefore we ' re exploring in each and every domain what we can do, either ourselves"", 'reference': '22', 'full_answer': ""we ' re also very much aware that high energy prices are a major challenge for businesses large and small across our union."", 'sentence_beginning': "" we ' re also very much aware "", 'sentence_end': ' are a major challenge for businesses large and small across our union.', 'similarity_score': 0.7034750580787659}, {'answer': 'increased victims of gender based violence', 'confidence': np.float32(0.048957847), 'start': np.int64(201), 'end': np.int64(206), 'context': ""madame president, honourable members, i am really honoured and happy to be here, honourable members. it is also wonderful to be here in person, even with these restrictions. to see you present here, because it is a first sign that we are slowly recovering from the pandemic and slowly going back to business as usual. and i have to say, i would have never thought a year ago that i would be craving for what bruce springsteen calls ‘ a human touch ', but we really are in need of meeting each other again and discussing many things. the challenges we face are daunting-in the next months and years we will have to confront the real cost of the pandemic, both when it comes to our economy as well as restoring fairness and equality in our societies. one issue i would explicitly want to mention is what this has done to woman and girls across the european union. very often frontline workers, but also, sadly again, increased victims of gender based violence. this has put society on edge. the most vulnerable in society have paid the highest price. women, girls, but also minorities across the european union, and people in vulnerable social and economic situations. given the role of this institution, i think it is important that we discuss those things you represent all voices in society-businesses, workers, civil society. and we need to discuss it with you. we need to zoom in on a topic that is very close to my heart : how to make the european green deal a just and social deal. very simple, the european green deal is going to be just, or there is just not going to be a european green deal. the need to take climate action i would like to start by thanking you and this institution for the support for our increased climate ambitions for 2030. i think it is quite an achievement. the european economic and social committee is, as i said, a microcosm of wider european society. if the debate here is along those lines, i am sure it reflects the situation in our society. also with different interests, taking different positions and then coming to joint conclusions. that is the strength of the european social model. so what you show here is, even with these different interests, all those voices can point to the same direction : the urgent need to act against the twin crises of the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis. we at the commission share this feeling of urgency. despite the covid crisis, the call from citizens to take action against these"", 'reference': '4', 'full_answer': 'very often frontline workers, but also, sadly again, increased victims of gender based violence.', 'sentence_beginning': ' very often frontline workers, but also, sadly again, ', 'sentence_end': '.', 'similarity_score': 0.7026951909065247}]",deregulation
