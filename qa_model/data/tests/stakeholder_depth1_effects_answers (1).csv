reconciling international subsidy rules with industrial decarbonisation environmental subsidies could be justified when emissions taxation is not feasible or is insufficient due to political economy constraints. executive summary the vast environmental subsidies that may be required for the transition to netzero greenhouse gas emissions are starting to generate international trade and political frictions between the world \' s largest economies. this puts (supra) national industrial decarbonisation efforts on a collision course with international subsidies rules and national countervailing duty (ie antiforeign subsidy) laws and regulations. international cooperation will be essential to defuse such tensions before they escalate and impede effective climate policy rollouts, and before they lead to economic countermeasures that create new barriers to trade in environmental goods. this requires agreement on permissible environmental subsidy practices that minimise distortions. meanwhile, it will be crucial to provide financial transfers to assist poorer economies with industrial decarbonisation at the same time as those poorer economies are suffering from the crossborder negative economic impacts of otherwise netglobalwelfare enhancing environmental subsidies paid out by wealthy countries. various forums can host the technical and political negotiations necessary to set the parameters of net globalwelfare enhancing subsidies. these include the g7, the g20, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, the world trade organisation \' s trade and environment committee and wto trade and environmental sustainability structured discussions, and the coalition of trade ministers on climate. the author thanks ronald steenblik, jeromin zettelmeyer,

that supports the attainment of environmental objectives that would remain elusive if left to market forces (charnovitz, 2014). there is a strong economic argument that subsidies are an essential instrument in the transformation towards the netzero global economy. while taxation can address the negative environmental externalities of emissions (reflecting the polluterpays principle), it cannot simultaneously correct the externalities associated with green innovation. as the united nations environment programme (unep) pointed out in 2003 : "" public financing is essential for the transition

accordingly, many discussions have been raised on the implementation of the cbam, including what would be the best way to allocate the revenues raised thanks to the mechanism. energy intensive industries within europe have called for these revenues to be clearly allocated domestically to accelerate the development of lowcarbon technologies and decarbonise energy intensive sectors.

in different areas of climate policymaking, all of which have their own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be

purchase all of the necessary eu ets allowances on the market to remain globally competitive, as the remaining allowances are freely allocated to them. the cbam plans to gradually replace free allowances with a price on the carbon emissions embedded in imports. following a transitionalprimarily monitoring phase, this price on embedded emissions will be gradually introduced from 2026 on the imports of certain products. while the cbam can mitigate carbon leakage, production declines in greenhousegas intensive industries as a result of limiting free allowances, and rising carbon prices, it cannot compensate for them completely. in particular, the cbam does not provide sufficient protection for exporters to non eu coun tries. it is crucial that the cbam does not lead to trade con flicts that would make multilateral cooperation more difficult. international cooperation is indispensable, as it is the only way to reduce global emissions. the european union (eu) has set a goal to become

production. by taxing carbonintensive imports, the eu says it will help its domestic companies take ambitious climate action while still remaining competitive with firms in nations where environmental laws are less strict. there is evidence that the cbam is also driving other governments to launch tougher carbonpricing policies of their own, to avoid paying border taxes to the eu. it has also helped to shift climate and trade up the international climate agenda, potentially contributing to a broader increase in ambition. however, at a time of growing protectionism and economic rivalry between major powers, the new levy has proved controversial. many developing countries have branded cbams as "" unfair "" policies that will leave them worse off financially, saying they will make it

own similarities, differences, and key considerations. 1. introduction the concept of leakage plays an important role in climate policy discussions and design. leakage generally is shorthand for carbon leakage, which, even if intuitively understood as referring to greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, can be defined in several ways. leakage can also refer to production or investment, in which case industrial competitiveness is the more salient concern. the two concepts are often treated as overlapping, as this allows for environmental justification of policy measures that aim to protect competitiveness. different types of leakage have different impacts and implications for policymaking. they require (and deserve) different policy responses to mitigate their adverse effects. this issue brief discusses how the concept of leakage affects climate policymaking and policy design and suggests distinguishing among types of leakage. as countries decarbonize their industries at different speeds, and as new closetocarbonneutral (or netzerocompatible) industrial goods enter the market, the range of carbon intensities in traded industrial goods will be wider than ever, and the prospect of leakage may increase as well. netzerocompatible goods can be generally understood as technologies and activities that can continue well beyond the point where a jurisdiction has achieved netzero emissionsor indefinitelyeither by no longer emitting at all or by emitting in sufficiently limited quantities such that the residual emissions can be offset by carbon removal. the latter inevitably depends on political choices and constraints. it is helpful to distinguish among different types of leakage that may potentially arise so that any mitigating policy measures are effectively designed. four types of leakage are discussed in section 2. the intuition behind carbon leakage is that by enacting climate policy through pricing or regulation in one country, and thereby raising the costs of emitting ghgs, producers will move at least some of their production elsewhere to a region with lower carbon constraints, thereby offsetting the environmental gain while also undermining economic performancea potential loselose outcome. a closer look at the various elements of potential leakage can be instructive. the worst case of carbon leakage involves a scenario in which emissions elsewhere increase by more than they are reduced in the region increasing its carbon constraints. however, a scenario in which emissions decrease by 100 metric tons in country', 'reference': '920',

18 may a communication on business taxation for the 21st century to promote a robust, efficient and fair business tax system in the european union. advertisement why has the european commission adopted a communication on business taxation for the 21st century ? the eu needs a robust, efficient and fair business tax framework that supports the post covid19 recovery, removes obstacles to crossborder investment in the single market and creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth. today \' s communication sets out both a longterm vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and eu tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. this agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the eu in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions. what are the main problems this communication addresses ? it is already clear that our economies and societies are being shaped by ongoing major trends : the current international corporate tax system was designed more than a century ago and is based on outdated principles of tax residence and source. developments in globalisation and digitalisation have left these principles increasingly out of sync with today \' s economy and have made tax rules increasingly difficult to apply to modern business realities. in the eu, the patchwork of national corporate tax rules is complicated for businesses operating crossborder in the single market. grappling with up to 27 different national tax systems creates particular challenges for eu smes, startups and other businesses looking to grow, expand and trade crossborder. this hurts investment and growth, as well as the eu \' s competitiveness. while corporate income is taxed at national level, business models continue to become ever more international, complex and digital. this creates high compliance costs for business and risks of double taxation. at the same time, some companies exploit loopholes between tax systems through aggressive tax planning strategies. this also makes it difficult for citizens to know how much companies are actually paying in tax, which risks undermining trust in the tax system as a whole. what will the commission propose to tackle these issues ? in the longterm, today \' s communication presents a plan for a new framework for business taxation in the eu, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax obstacles and foster a more businessfriendly environment in the single market. the "" business in europe : framework for income taxation "" (or befi',

in order to rebuild the competitiveness of our nfm industry, the only way is to ensure globally competitive production costs, starting with access to energy. eurometaux has long been calling for the

where metals such as gallium, arsenic, platinum and other precious metals, etc. must be used to spur digitalisation and development of infrastructure to support the deployment of smart technology. likewise, we need antimony, aluminium, lead, etc. for our defence industry to manufacture ammunition, flak jackets, etc. without nfms made in, and for, europe we will not be able to have the strategic autonomy that we need for renewable energy, digitalisation and our defence. the need to have a european nfm industry is a first order magnitude must, otherwise we will neither have physical security,

only way is to ensure globally competitive production costs, starting with access to energy. eurometaux has long been calling for the european commission and the member states to create the right conditions for these industrial facilities to come back into production and to invest in the development of 10 new mines for nfms, 15 new processing facilities and 15 new recycling facilities. these
