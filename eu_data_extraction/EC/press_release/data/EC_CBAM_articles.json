        "text": "MerciBruno, dear colleagues,\nAs Russia's aggression continues against Ukraine, we are continuing to mount pressure from our side. As Bruno already mentioned, as of today the EU will stop treating Russia as a Most Favoured Nation at the World Trade Organization.\nThis is an unprecedented move and it is backed by a very large trading bloc of countries alongside the Members of the EU.\nTogether, the countries which are imposing this measure represent more than 40% of the world's GDP.\nThis deepens Russia's pariah status in the eyes of the global community. This was part of the fourth sanctions package which was also agreed today to cripple Putin's war machine and ramp up economic pressure.\nThere are further steps concerning state-owned enterprises of Russia, export bans concerning certain key goods in the iron and steel sectors from Russia, a ban on luxury goods and a ban on new investments in the Russian energy sector.\nThese new sanctions will cut Russia off even further and drain its resources to finance this barbaric war.\nSo one can say that Russia has become the most-sanctioned nation in the world, which is a very dubious honour indeed.\nIf we look at the impact of the sanctions on Russia, we see the rouble has crashed.\nTrading on the Moscow Stock Exchange remains suspended.\nRussia's credit rating has been downgraded to junk status – just about default levels.\nMany international companies are leaving the country.\nHowever, Europe's sanctions - and Russia's counter-sanctions too - will have implications and also a cost for the EU economies.\nWe will see overall higher inflation, pressure on energy and food prices, and market volatility.\nRising energy and commodities prices, disruptions of supply chains: it will all have a negative knock-on effect on consumer prices and investment.\nHowever, uncertainty remains very high, which makes it impossible to assess reliably the economic impact at this stage. But it is clear that that growth is going to be severely impacted.\nOn energy, we depend far too much on Russia for gas, oil and coal. Last year, Russia provided around 45% of the EU's total gas imports.\nFor crude oil, it was also the largest supplier of EU imports.\nSo we have to move away from Russia.\nWe have known this for years. But now it is really the time to make this move. And we intend to do so quickly.\nAt the same time, the crisis is hitting the EU economy just when its expansion was regaining momentum after the COVID-19 crisis.\nOur fundamentals are solid, so we will be able to withstand this crisis. We already have several tools at our disposal.\nThe general escape clause will stay active this year: Member States have the flexibility to put extra support measures in place as needed.\nWe should alleviate the impact of higher energy prices on the most vulnerable households and companies. And we are working on temporary crisis state aid rules to help support companies hard hit by the crisis and by high energy prices.\nFor the medium term, we should be making the best use of the Recovery and Resilience Facility.\nIt is a powerful tool to reinforce our resilience, by:\nThere is still €200 billion available in loans that Member States can request up to August 2023 to finance more investments and reforms. That is a massive amount which can be used to respond to certain challenges arising from the conflict - for example, to accelerate the development of renewables.\nOn the fiscal side, short-term costs may be significant for national budgets. There will be additional expenditure from providing economic and material aid to Ukraine, assisting refugees and supporting national economies.\nSo it is very important to focus on maintaining fiscal coordination and stability.\nTurning now to taxation:\nWe are delighted about this agreement on a general approach on the border adjustment mechanism to prevent carbon leakage.\nAs you know, the CBAM aims to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports, thereby making sure that the EU's climate objectives are not undermined and neither is the competitiveness of EU companies.\nSeveral issues are still to be agreed upon within other related legislative proposals. These include revising the Emissions Trading Scheme and new own resources, for example.\nSo we are confident that in the weeks and months to come, we will manage to find good solutions for those issues as well.\nAnd as Bruno said, ministers also continued their debate on our proposed Directive to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for the global activities of multinationals with a worldwide turnover of more than €750 million.\nWe will come back to this issue at the April Ecofin.\nThank you and I am open to your questions.",

        "title": "Joint statement on the second meeting of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council",
        "date": "Feb 28, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The second meeting of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council (TTC) took place in New Delhi on 28 February 2025. Executive Vice-Presidentfor Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy HennaVirkkunen, Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Interinstitutional Relations and TransparencyMarosŠefčovičand Commissioner for Startups, Research and Innovation EkaterinaZaharievaco-chaired on the EU side. It was co-chaired on the Indian side by India's External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar; Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal; and Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw.\nEuropean Commission President Ursulavon der Leyenand Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had established the EU-India TTC in April 2022 as a key bilateral platform to address challenges at the confluence of trade, trusted technology and security. The European Union and India, as two large and vibrant democracies with open market economies, shared values and pluralistic societies, are natural partners in a multipolar world.\nThe deepening of bilateral relations and the growing strategic convergence between the EU and India respond to the shifting dynamics of the global geopolitical landscape and a common interest in promoting global stability, economic security, and sustainable and inclusive growth. In that respect, both sides emphasized again the importance of the rules-based international order and the full respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, transparency, and peaceful resolution of disputes. The TTC reflects a shared acknowledgement between the EU and India of the increasingly critical links between trade and technology, the potential of cooperation on these issues to enhance the economies of both partners, and the need to work together on the related security challenges. Both sides note the potential of their partnership to increase resilience, strengthen connectivity and drive forward the development of green and clean technologies.\nThe first meeting of the EU-India TTC was held in Brussels on 16 May 2023. The TTC Ministerial Meeting provided political guidance for the way forward. Subsequently on 24 November 2023, a stock-taking meeting in virtual mode reviewed the progress made by the three TTC working groups.\nWorking Group 1 on Strategic Technologies, Digital Governance, and Digital Connectivity\nThe European Union and India reaffirmed the importance of deepening their digital cooperation in line with their shared values through the Working Group 1 on Strategic Technologies, Digital Governance, and Digital Connectivity. Both sides committed to leverage their respective strengths to accelerate a human-centric digital transformation and the development of advanced and trustworthy digital technologies such as AI, semiconductors, High-Performance Computing and 6G, which will benefit both economies and societies. Both sides committed to work jointly to strengthen EU-India research and innovation for this purpose to further enhance competitiveness, while increasing their economic security. Both sides committed to promoting global connectivity in a cyber-secure digital ecosystem.\nRecognizing the importance of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for the development of open and inclusive digital economies and digital societies, the European Union and India agreed to collaborate on working towards interoperability of their respective DPIs that respect human rights and protect personal data, privacy, and intellectual property rights. Both sides further committed to jointly promote DPIs solutions to third countries and further emphasized the need of mutual recognition of e-signatures to enhance cross-border digital transactions and foster mutual economic growth.\nBoth sides emphasized their commitment to further strengthen the resilience of semiconductor supply chains and promote collaboration in the field of semiconductors. To that end, they agreed to explore joint R&D in the field of chip design, heterogeneous integration, sustainable semiconductor technologies, technology development for advanced processes for process design kit (PDK), among others. Both sides shall promote the strengthening of the EU and Indian semiconductor ecosystems to enhance technological capabilities and ensure supply chain resilience by developing sustainable, secure and diversified semiconductor production capacities. Furthermore, they committed to developing a dedicated programme that will facilitate talent exchanges and foster semiconductor skills among students and young professionals.\nThe two sides reiterated their commitment to safe, secure, trustworthy, human-centric, sustainable and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) and to promote this vision on the international level. In addition, with a view to ensuring continued and impactful cooperation on AI, the European AI Office and India AI Mission agreed to deepen cooperation, encouraging an ecosystem of innovation and fostering information exchange on common open research questions for developing trustworthy AI. They also agreed to enhance cooperation on large language models, and to harness the potential of AI for human development and common good, including through joint projects such as developing tools and frameworks for ethical and responsible AI. These will build on the progress made under R&D collaboration on high-performance computing applications in the areas of natural hazards, climate change, and bioinformatics.\nThe EU and India welcomed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Bharat 6G Alliance and the EU 6G Smart Networks and Services Industry Association for aligning research and development priorities and creating secured and trusted telecommunications and resilient supply chains. Both sides will also enhance cooperation on IT and telecoms standardisation with a particular focus on promoting interoperable global standards.\nFurthermore, the two sides agreed to work towards bridging the digital skills gap, explore mutual recognition of certifications, and promote legal pathways of skilled professionals and exchange of talent.\nBoth sides agreed to collaborate on the implementation of the Global Digital Compact, agreed by consensus at the UN General Assembly in September 2024, as a key instrument for delivering on their shared objectives. They noted the need to ensure that the forthcoming World Summit on Information Society +20 maintains global support for and enhances the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance.\nWorking Group 2 on Clean and Green Technologies\nThe European Union and India recalled the importance of the priority workstreams identified under Working Group 2 on Clean and Green Technologies for achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and 2070 for the European Union and India, respectively.* Achieving these targets will require significant investment in new clean technologies and standards. An emphasis on research and innovation (R&I) will foster technological collaboration and exchange of best practices between the EU and India. In parallel, supporting technological innovations for market uptake will enhance access to the respective markets by EU and Indian enterprises and facilitate wide adoption of innovative technologies. This opens perspectives for cooperation between EU and Indian incubators, SMEs and start-ups and building human resource capability and capacity in such technologies.\nIn this regard, both sides agreed on joint research cooperation through exceptional coordinated calls on recycling of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), marine plastic litter, and waste-to-hydrogen. The estimated total joint budget will be about EUR 60 million from the Horizon Europe programme and from matching Indian contributions. On recycling of batteries for EVs, the focus will be on battery circularity through different kinds of flexible/low cost/easy to recycle batteries. In marine plastic litter, the focus will be on developing technologies for detection, measurement and analysis of aquatic litter and for mitigation of the cumulative impact of pollution on the marine environment. On waste-to-hydrogen, the focus will be on developing technologies with greater efficiency to produce hydrogen from biogenic wastes.\nThe two sides recalled the importance of the substantive exchanges between experts in the identified areas of cooperation as the basis for future action. Indian experts have participated in a training and mutual learning exercise on EV interoperability and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) E-Mobility Lab in Ispra, Italy in January 2024. Furthermore, a joint hybrid workshop on EV Charging Technologies (Standardisation and Testing) was organised at the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune, India and online, to deepen the EU-Indian dialogue and the industry's engagement in charging infrastructure standardisation processes with India. The two sides also concluded a Matchmaking Event to identify, support and organise exchanges between EU and Indian startups in technology for recycling of batteries for EVs. Experts also jointly discussed assessment and monitoring tools for marine plastic litter. Finally, an “Ideathon” fostering EU-India collaboration to co-create practical solutions involving all stakeholders for addressing marine plastic pollution effectively is in preparation.\nBoth sides agreed to explore cooperation on harmonising standards for EV charging infrastructure, including cooperative, pre-normative research for harmonised testing solutions and knowledge exchange in the domain of e-mobility. They also agreed to explore how to enhance collaboration in the field of hydrogen-related safety standards, the science of standards as well as the market uptake of wastewater treatment technologies as outcomes of previous jointly conducted research projects.\nWorking Group 3 on Trade, Investment and Resilient Value Chains\nThe European Union and India noted productive discussions under Working Group 3 on Trade, Investment and Resilient Value Chains with a view to building a closer economic partnership between the European Union and India. In an increasingly challenging geopolitical context, both sides committed to work together for creating wealth and shared prosperity. The work under Working Group 3 complements the ongoing negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) and a Geographical Indications Agreement which are proceeding on separate tracks.\nBoth sides committed to fostering resilient and future-ready value chains by prioritizing transparency, predictability, diversification, security and sustainability. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress made on Agri-food, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Clean Technologies sectors and agreed on work plans in these three fields with the aim of promoting value chains that can withstand global challenges.\nIn agriculture, the EU and India intend to collaborate on contingency planning for food security and welcomed common efforts on shared research and innovations needs regarding climate-resilient practices, crop diversification and infrastructure improvements as promoted for cooperation through the G20 framework. In the pharmaceutical sector, both sides aim to enhance transparency and security in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) supply chains by mapping vulnerabilities, promoting sustainable manufacturing, and establishing early warning systems to prevent disruptions. Clean technology cooperation centers on strengthening supply chains for solar energy, offshore wind, and clean hydrogen by exchanging information on sectoral capabilities and investment incentives and Research, Development and Innovation priorities as well as on methodologies to assess vulnerabilities, discussing approaches to minimize trade barriers and exploring possible synergies of the supply chains. Across these sectors, the EU and India are working to foster investment, exchange best practices, and mitigate risks through regular dialogues, research collaborations, and business-to-business engagements, ensuring supply chain resilience and sustainable economic growth.\nBoth sides acknowledged that relevant priority market access issues are being addressed through cooperation within the TTC framework. The EU side appreciated the Indian initiatives to approve the marketing of several EU plant products while the Indian side appreciated the listing of a number of Indian aquaculture establishments and taking up the issue of equivalence for agricultural organic products. Both sides agreed to pursue their efforts on these topics, under the TTC review mechanism, and to continue their engagement on remaining issues flagged by each other.\nThe two sides noted the exchanges regarding best practices in the screening of Foreign Direct Investments, which is an area of growing importance to foster economic security.\nThe EU and India strengthened their commitment towards the multilateral trading system as an anchor in the current challenging geopolitical context. At the same time, they recognized the need to bring necessary reform to the WTO so that it is able to address efficiently and effectively issues of interest to Members. Both sides also recognized the importance of a functioning dispute settlement system. For this purpose, they agreed to deepen their dialogue and engagement to help the WTO deliver concrete outcomes, including at MC14.\nBoth sides have held in-depth discussions on trade and decarbonization through several bilateral channels and have engaged jointly with stakeholders, especially on the implementation of the EU's carbon border mechanism (CBAM). Both sides discussed the challenges arising out of CBAM implementation, in particular for the small and medium enterprises and agreed to continue addressing them.\nThe co-chairs reaffirmed their commitment to expanding and deepening their engagement under the TTC and to working together to fulfill the goals laid out in this successful second meeting of the TTC. They agreed to meet again for the third meeting of TTC within one year from now.\n*Updated on 4 March 2025 at 11:45 CET.",

        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The European Commission has adopted a new package of proposals to simplify EU rules, boost competitiveness, and unlock additional investment capacity. This is a major step forward in creating a more favourable business environment to help EU companies grow, innovate, and create quality jobs.\nBy bringing our competitiveness and climate goals together, we are creating the conditions for EU businesses to thrive, attract investment, achieve our shared goals – such as the European Green Deal objectives – and unlock our full economic potential.\nThe Commission has a clear target to deliver an unprecedented simplification effort, by achieving at least 25% reduction in administrative burdens, and at least 35% for SMEs until the end of this mandate. These first ‘Omnibus' packages, bringing together proposals in a number of related legislative fields, cover a far-reaching simplification in the fields of sustainable finance reporting, sustainability due diligence, EU Taxonomy, carbon border adjustment mechanism, and European investment programmes.\nThese proposals will reduce complexity of EU requirements for all businesses, notably SMEs and small mid-caps, focus our regulatory framework on the largest companies which are likely to have a bigger impact on the climate and the environment, while still enabling companies to access sustainable finance for their clean transition.\nIf adopted and implemented as set out today, the proposals are conservatively estimated to bring totalsavings in annual administrative costs of around €6.3 billionand tomobilise additional public and private investment capacity of €50 billionto support policy priorities.\nPresident Ursulavon der Leyensaid: \"Simplification promised, simplification delivered! We are presenting our first proposal for far-reaching simplification. EU companies will benefit from streamlined rules on sustainable finance reporting, sustainability due diligence and taxonomy. This will make life easier for our businesses while ensuring we stay firmly on course toward our decarbonisation goals. And more simplification is on the way\".\nSpecifically,the main changes in the area of sustainability reporting(CSRD and EU Taxonomy) will:\nThemain changes in the area of sustainability due diligencewill:\nThemain changes on CBAM will:\nThe Commission is also proposing a series of amendments to simplify and optimise the use of several investment programs including InvestEU, EFSI, and legacy financial instruments.\nInvestEU, the EU's largest risk-sharing instrument to support priority investments within the Union, plays a key role in addressing financial barriers and driving the investments needed for competitiveness, research and innovation, decarbonisation, environmental sustainability and skills. Currently, close to 45 % of its operations are supporting climate objectives.\nThe proposed changes:\nThe legislative proposals will now be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council for their consideration and adoption. The changes on the CSRD, CSDDD, and CBAM will enter into force once the co-legislators have reached an agreement on the proposals and after publication in the EU Official Journal. In line with the Communication on simplification and implementation published on 11 January 2024, the Commission invites the co-legislators to treat this omnibus package with priority, in particular the proposal postponing certain disclosure requirements under the CSRD and the transposition deadline under CSDDD, as they aim to address key concerns identified by stakeholders.\nThe draft Delegated Act amending the current delegated acts under the Taxonomy Regulation will be adopted after public feedback and will apply at the end of the scrutiny period by the European Parliament and the Council.",

        "title": "A Clean Industrial Deal for competitiveness and decarbonisation in the EU",
        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Today, the Commission presents theClean Industrial Deal, a bold business plan to support the competitiveness and resilience of our industry. The Deal will accelerate decarbonisation, while securing the future of manufacturing in Europe.\nFaced with high energy costs and fierce and often unfair global competition, our industries need urgent support. This Deal positions decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth for European industries. This framework can drive competitiveness as it gives certainty and predictability to companies and investors that Europe remains committed to become a decarbonised economy by 2050.\nPresident Ursulavon der Leyensaid: “Europe is not only a continent of industrial innovation, but also a continent of industrial production. However, the demand for clean products has slowed down, and some investments have moved to other regions. We know that too many obstacles still stand in the way of our European companies from high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden. The Clean Industrial Deal is to cut the ties that still hold our companies back and make a clear business case for Europe.”\nThe Commission is also takingactionsto make our regulatory environment more efficient while reducing bureaucratic hurdles for businesses. Today's measures are the results  of the active engagement with industry leaders, social partners and civil society in the context of the Antwerp Declaration for a EuropeanIndustrialDeal and the European Commission'sClean Transition Dialogues.\nA business plan to decarbonise, reindustrialise and innovate\nThe Deal focuses mainly on two closely linked sectors: energy-intensive industries and clean tech.\ni)Energy-intensive industriesas they require urgent support to decarbonise and electrify. The sector faces high energy costs, unfair global competition and complex regulations, harming its competitiveness. ii)Clean Techis at the heart of future competitiveness and growth as well as crucial for industrial transformation.Circularityis also a central element of the Deal, as we need to maximise EU's limited resources and reduce overdependencies on third country suppliers for raw materials.\nThe Deal presents measures strengthening the entire value chain. It serves as a framework to tailor action in specific sectors. The Commission will present an Action Plan for theautomotive industryin March and an Action Plan onsteel and metalsin Spring. Other tailored actions are planned for the chemical and clean tech industry.\nToday's Communication identifiesbusiness driversfor industry to succeed in the EU:\nAffordable energy is the foundation of competitiveness. The Commission therefore adopted today anAction Plan on Affordable Energyto lower energy bills for industries, businesses and households. The Act will speed up the roll-out of clean energy, accelerate electrification, complete our internal energy market with physical interconnections, and use energy more efficiently and cut dependence on imported fossil fuels.\nTheIndustrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Actwill increase demand for EU-made clean products, byintroducingsustainability,resilience, and made in Europe criteriain public and private procurements.With the review of the Public Procurement Framework in 2026, the Commission will introduce sustainability, resilience andEuropean preference criteriain public procurement for strategic sectors.\nThe Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act will also launcha voluntary carbon intensity labelfor industrial products, starting with steel in 2025, followed by cement. The Commission willsimplify and harmonise carbon accounting methodologies.These labels will inform consumers and allow manufacturers to reap a premium on their decarbonisation efforts.\nIn the short-term, the Clean Industrial Deal will mobiliseover€100 billionto support EU-made clean manufacturing. This amount includes an additional€1 billionguarantees under the current Multiannual Financial Framework.\nThe Commission will:\nTheEuropean Investment Bank(EIB) Group will also launch a series of concrete new financing instruments to support the Clean Industrial Deal. The EIB will launch: i) a ‘Grids manufacturing package' to provide counter-guarantees and other de-risking support to manufacturers of grid components; ii) a joint European Commission-EIB pilot programme of counter-guarantees for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) undertaken by SMEs and energy intensive industries; and iii) launch a CleanTech guarantee Facility under the Tech EU programme powered by InvestEU.\nCritical raw materials are key for our industry. The EU therefore has to secure access to such materials and reduce exposure to unreliable suppliers. At the same time, placing circularity at the core of our decarbonisation strategy helps maximising the EU's limited resources. The Commission will therefore:\nThe EU needs reliable global partners more than ever. In addition to ongoing and new trade agreements, the Commission will soon launch the firstClean Trade and Investment Partnerships,which will diversify supply chains and forge mutually beneficial deals. At the same time, the Commission will act even more decisively to protect our industries from unfair global competition and overcapacities through a range of Trade Defence and other instruments. The Commission will also simplify and strengthen the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nThe transformation of our industry requires skilled people and top talents. The Commission will establish aUnion of Skillsthat invests in workers, develops skills and creates quality jobs. With Up to €90million from Erasmus+, the Deal will help reinforce sectoral skills for strategic industries linked to the Clean Industrial Deal. The Deal also supports quality jobs, promote social conditionalities and provide further support to workers in transitions.\nBackground\nIn herpolitical guidelines(2024-2029), President von der Leyen announced to deliver the Clean Industrial Deal within the first 100 days of the Commission's mandate as a priority to ensure competitiveness and prosperity in the EU.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal builds further on the active engagement from industry leaders, social partners and civil society in the context of the Antwerp Declaration for a EuropeanIndustrialDeal and theClean Transition Dialogues.\nFor More Information\nTheClean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for decarbonisation and competitiveness\nQuestions & Answerson the Clean Industrial Deal\nFactsheeton the Clean Industrial Deal\nPress releaseon the Action Plan on Affordable Energy\nCompetitiveness - European Commission\nAudiovisual Service",

        "date": "Jul 8, 2021",
        "location": "no location found",
        "text": "Madame President, Honourable Members,\nI am really honoured and happy to be here, honourable Members. It is also wonderful to be here in person, even with these restrictions. To see you present here, because it is a first sign that we are slowly recovering from the pandemic and slowly going back to business as usual. And I have to say, I would have never thought a year ago that I would be craving for what Bruce Springsteen calls ‘a human touch', but we really are in need of meeting each other again and discussing many things.\nThe challenges we face are daunting - in the next months and years we will have to confront the real cost of the pandemic, both when it comes to our economy as well as restoring fairness and equality in our societies. One issue I would explicitly want to mention is what this has done to woman and girls across the European Union. Very often frontline workers, but also, sadly again, increased victims of gender-based violence. This has put society on edge. The most vulnerable in society have paid the highest price. Women, girls, but also minorities across the European Union, and people in vulnerable social and economic situations. Given the role of this institution, I think it is important that we discuss those things\nYou represent all voices in society -businesses, workers, civil society. And we need to discuss it with you. We need to zoom in on a topic that is very close to my heart: how to make the European Green Deal a just and social deal. Very simple, the European Green Deal is going to be just, or there is just not going to be a European Green Deal.\nThe need to take climate action\nI would like to start by thanking you and this institution for the support for our increased climate ambitions for 2030. I think it is quite an achievement. The European Economic and Social Committee is, as I said, a microcosm of wider European society.  If the debate here is along those lines, I am sure it reflects the situation in our society. Also with different interests, taking different positions and then coming to joint conclusions. That is the strength of the European Social model. So what you show here is, even with these different interests, all those voices can point to the same direction: the urgent need to act against the twin crises of the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis.\nWe at the Commission share this feeling of urgency. Despite the Covid crisis, the call from citizens to take action against these twin crises hasn't gone away. Citizens sense that this is needed if we want avoid dangerous tipping points for nature and our world. They also know that the cost of non-acting, to see those tipping points spiral out of control, will dwarf the cost of doing something about it now, because very often we only talk about the costs of transition, but we should compare it to the cost of non-transition, which both in human terms and financial terms is much higher. That is why our two institutions support a green recovery, to avoid the ‘pound smart, penny foolish' approach to rebuild whilst restoring the economy of the past.\nWe will be mobilising 1.8 trillion euros in the coming seven years. If we don't spend them well, what is the legacy we leave for our children and grandchildren? How big will the debt be, how big will the unsustainable debt be they will be left with in an economy that doesn't meet the demand of the future?\nSo we better get this right. We better get this right in the decisions that we'll be taking in the upcoming years. They could have a huge influence on the livelihood and lives of our children and grandchildren. I can only compare it to what happened on our continent after the end of the Second World War where our grandparents were also called upon rebuilding Europe. They did not do it for themselves, but they did it for our children and grandchildren and we need to rekindle that feeling that now it's up to us to do something not for ourselves mainly, but mainly for our children and grandchildren.\nClimate action is socially fair\nThe first ones to suffer from the climate and biodiversity crises are vulnerable households. Small farmers who already struggle to get a fair price for their produce would face huge difficulties with increased droughts and freak weather events. They've kept us all fed, and fed well, during the pandemic. But there is no vaccine against droughts, against firestorms, against real changes in our natural environment, against the disappearance of more than 1 million species, pollinators, and more.\nSo by tackling climate change and biodiversity loss together, we deliver a better world for all.\nBut we should not close our eyes to reality. Whilst the destination of a sustainable and fair society may be clear, the pathway to get there will be tough and very hard work. Don't create the illusion with people that it's going to be easy. If you tell them it's going to be easy now, they will be disappointed later. Better prepare them for what is going to be a tough transition. We need everyone to come along, we need everyone to do their part.\nToday, I renew my pledge that we will pursue an inclusive Green Deal, as it's the only way to have a Green Deal. On the 14th of July, we will come with a big package of climate proposals, the Fit for 55 package.\nWe will hardwire social fairness in these proposals. We will do it in two ways. First, throughout our proposals, we will share the burden of taking climate action in a fair way between industries, governments and citizens. Second, a lot has been said in recent weeks about the possibility that we extend emissions trading to heating and transport fuels, to put a carbon price on them. The electricity that we use is already part of that trading, and we need a stronger incentive for other fuels to bring down emissions.\nSo the climate rationale is clear, and logical. The social rationale, by contrast, may not be as clear, at least not immediately. But rest assured, if we do take this step and if households face growing costs as a result, we will ensure that a social mechanism, a climate action social fund, is in place that can compensate for any possible adverse effects, especially for our most vulnerable citizens.\nI will get back to this last point because we are seriously working on proposals for that.\nInclusive Green Deal and Climate Action Social Fund\nFirst about the inclusivity of the European Green Deal. As your Committee has shown the European Green Deal is about doing things together - about everyone playing their fair part. Just like we cannot afford to leave anyone behind, we cannot allow one sector, one company, or one region to freeride. Such a freeride would be a ride over a cliff edge – and that is exactly what we want to avoid.\nThat's why in our package due on 14th of July, we will propose to share the burden in a fair way. We will push industries to innovate and bring citizens affordable clean solutions, for example by tightening the emissions trading system for industry, setting targets for the supply of renewable energy and targets for more electric vehicles to come to the market. If it comes to helping citizens to insulate their homes, we will double down on our Renovation Wave - our plan to assist households across Europe in renovating their houses, and to help neighbourhoods to make their schools and hospitals more energy efficient and bring down energy bills as a result.\nOver time, clean energy in our homes and electric cars will become cheaper and allow citizens to save on fuel cost. But therein lies the challenge: this will happen over time. These clean options won't be available at the same time to everyone, everywhere.\nBefore these options become cheaper, we must protect vulnerable households against potential price increases for heating and transport fuels, especially in regions where clean options aren't readily available. It is quite a difference whether you live in a very urbanised environment or in a more rural environment. These aspects have a hugely impact on the way you live. So if we were to introduce emissions trading for these fuels, that means we must also take our commitment to social fairness a step further. Any proposal on emissions trading in these new sectors, must come with a proposal for the social impact at the same time.\nPart of the revenues generated from emissions trading in road transport and buildings could be put into a dedicated fund, so that Member States can use those revenues to compensate the cost of this transition to vulnerable citizens. If they receive financial assistance, they could be enabled to make the switch to clean alternatives like zero emission heating and cooling, or electric cars and then experience the financial benefits of that switch sooner as well.\nJust to give you the electric cars as an example, they are already cheaper to run today than a traditional combustion engine car, but not cheaper to buy. But in 6 to 7 years time, according to Bloomberg, they are also going to be cheaper to buy. It's a good example of how this transition in a short run might be difficult to grasp, but in a long run just makes a lot of sense.\nIt has been and will remain the European Commission's commitment – as well as my personal commitment – to make the European Green Deal a fair deal. The just transition must become a reality for there to be any transition at all. I think you will see on the 14th of July how we plan to live up to this commitment.\nOf course, we must also make the social pillar of our actions count in the supply chain, for all the workers in the mines, the farmers on the peatlands and the employees in the industry value chains that will undergo a big transformation on their way to a climate neutral future.\nAgain here, we always say there is 2 million more jobs in the new economy. But you have to add to that, that there is also going to be a huge amount of jobs that are going to be disappearing with the old economy. We need to make sure that the people who are in the old economy have the opportunity to switch to the new economy. That is a huge transformational issue. We are in a good position, demographically as Europe, to do this in a right way.\nI am a child of the transformation in my own home region. We went away from coal at a time where we were also in an energy crisis and economic crisis. The region actually never really recovered. Whereas now we have a different opportunity, we have huge opportunities in the new economy. The demographics are working for us. In some of the countries where coal is still dominant, unemployment is only 3 percent. If we do this right, if we organise this right, if we do it with the full involvement of social partners, we could really get this right, this time.\nSo on all these issues, honourable members, the Commission, my colleagues, Schmit, Breton, Vestager, Dombrovskis, we all work on this – The Energy Commissioner, the Agricultural Commissioner, everybody is working with the same goal.\nI hope we can continue our own cooperation, which I see as very important and fruitful. I want to thank you once again for your commitments to build a climate neutral and clean future for next generations.\nWe have the skills, funds, and brains to deliver on this green recovery and our European Green Deal. I look forward to the discussion on your ideas to make that happen.\nThank you very much, Madame President.\nClosing remarks EESC\nThank you very much. I will try and answer your questions and reflect on your remarks. My colleague and I have taken careful note of all that's been said and I'm sure we'll get an occasion to come back, so if I miss one or two or even more of your comments and you want to come back to me, I'm at your disposal at a later point. Especially once we have presented our plans in July and I'm sure at the latter part of this year we will have ample opportunity to reflect on some of these elements.\nLet me start by saying that obviously the global perspective is of huge importance, given the fact that Europe is responsible for about 8% of emissions. If we only move towards climate neutrality in Europe, we would not achieve very much for the planet as a whole. But when we started out on the European Green Deal, with our ambition to be the first climate neutral continent 2050, it was still pretty lonely out there.\nA lot has changed in the last year and a half, notably the change of government in the United States. A new commitment to the same goal, a new ambition also to have a successful COP in Glasgow in November. We've seen a Green Alliance we've entered into with Japan. Japan is also committing to climate neutrality by 2050, and the same is happening in South Korea and Canada. I was talking to my colleague from New Zealand this morning. In China: carbon neutrality by 2060.\nThis is becoming a global net zero movement. Not because they all believe that we did such a brilliant job and they think ‘well these Europeans know what they're doing, we will do the same.' No, because science telling them to do this. Science is telling them to do this. The climate crisis is upon us. It's happening. We have the droughts, the wildfires. We have the Gota Fría in Spain, which used to happen once every 50 years, and is now almost happening every year. It's happening and there's no denying. That's the reason why we need to act.\nWhen we talk about the social dimension, obviously it's not just about work, it's about all the aspects of the social dimension: education, healthcare, participation in society, and pensions, obviously. All these elements play a role, and all of them need to be made sustainable, which can only happen if we make the transition to a sustainable economy quicker than before. That part of the world is going to be the first to transit into a sustainable economy, a circular economy no longer dependent on fossil fuels. It is also going to be the continent with the highest level of growth, with the highest level of social cohesion. These are all interlinked.\nThat's why your work is so incredibly important. That we see the interlinkages and act upon it. It is true that there will be no Green Deal without a social deal, but turn it around: you have no social deal, no Green Deal, and then what happens? Who are then going to be the biggest victims of non-action? Of course we need to make sure that this is done in an equitable way and that we protect people who are most vulnerable, that's why we are proposing these measures to look to the social side.\nBut if the climate crisis gets out of hand, people who have money, rich people, they can move to higher places, to healthier places. People with ordinary jobs or without a job, they have nowhere to go. They will suffer the worst consequences, so please keep in mind when we talk about making this transition socially just, we need to keep in mind that if we don't make the transition, then social injustice will explode even more.\nI think this is important to understand that's why there is no contradiction between social justice and economic growth. Sustainable growth, not the traditional growth, and innovation and all these elements are extremely important. There is no conflict on this point, I would say, between employers and trade unions. We're on the same page, we have the same interests.\nOf course participation is of huge importance. I see this working on a daily basis in different industries where change is going to be huge. Look at the automotive industry, where only two years ago, a year and a half ago, we heard talking that ‘they were never going to make the emissions norms for 2021', ‘that we would have to impose huge fines', and ‘that the Member States would will be all over us to prevent us from actually opposing those fines'. And that then the whole thing would come crumbling down.\nBut they made it. The automotive industry was able to make it. And they've also turned the corner. They know that electric vehicles have the future and they know that insisting on continuing with internal combustion engine for passenger cars and for vans is not the way forward. So you see changes happening. Look at the price development of renewable energy, you no longer need huge amounts of subsidies for offshore wind or for solar. It pays for itself. So we also have some really good developments in our economy and society and we should build on that.\nWe should also make sure that all the jobs that come with these new developments can be filled by people who would have to learn the skills to do those jobs. These are very often local jobs, these are very often jobs that can be sustained over a very long period of time. That's the future, I would say, of our labour market. But it will only happen if social partners are fully involved in all these discussions.\nSocial partners have the full measure, also on deciding of how we organize this. And this is a discussion about the full social model, about the nature of work, about the nature of employment, about the nature of protection in employment about the lifelong learning issue, about how you treat people who retire.\nAll of this is going to be of extreme importance, which brings me to the next point and that is the intergenerational issue we need to face and I can't say this enough: we had a level of solidarity of young Europeans over the last year and a half that is inspiring. Many young people ran very low risk in the pandemic. Still, they wore the masks, they stayed inside and did everything. They did not do it for themselves, they did it for us. Now it's time we repay that by showing our solidarity with their future. That's what the Green Deal is all about, that's why we need to do this. I spoke about debt before, but also about the degradation of our natural environment, of the opportunities they will have. Housing is a huge part for them, education is a huge part for them.\nI was speaking earlier about low unemployment in some parts of Europe. I have to speak about the scourge of incredibly high youth unemployment at some other Member States. Sometimes half of our young people have no jobs, have no opportunity to find housing, have no opportunity to get a decent education. These are the things we need to fix, that have to be part of our Green Deal. They deserve it and we deserve it, because if we don't give them the skills they need in the economy of the future, we will lack the people to fill the jobs and then the jobs will leave Europe. It's that simple and that challenging at the same time.\nSo the industrial strategy we have developed and we're continuing to develop, is actually based on the knowledge that we are in twin transitions, we're in the middle of an industrial revolution right now and it's happening all across the world and it's happening at lightning speed. Europe can keep up with it, but only if we adapt, if we innovate. If we apply the new technology, if we invest in developing new technologies, if we use the right economies of scale in developing the technology, if we reach across borders.\nLook at the potential of for instance green hydrogen across the European Union, who would have thought that possible a couple of years ago, and here we go. International partners want to be part of that; Europe leads the way. Thierry Breton's idea of looking at sectors as ecosystems is working well for us, because it also means that we can involve with employees and trade unions on the basis of that ecosystem. What's going to happen in that industry, how are you involved, how can you play the full measure of your role, what is the outcome of this transformation. I think this is extremely important.\nParticipation is essential. I've spoken with the with Nicolas Schmit and the trade unions and employers last week. We will continue these dialogues also per sector. All my colleagues are very much engaged in this. We have a Climate Pact that will allow also participation of wider society into this. And we need to reinvent also new and innovative forms of social dialogue, not just on a national basis but also across borders, to show that everybody is involved.\nOn forests, I know this is a very topical issue, and I know this is an issue that leads to a lot of emotions. I would say we need to look for a virtuous triangle, which is: sustainable forests, economically viable forests, offering also a social basis for communities living off and in forests. That is what we need to reach. But we also have to be brutally honest about the fact that, although the forest coverage is going up, the health of our forests is going down. 75% of Europe's forests are in a bad shape. Especially if you also address the issue of biodiversity loss. A forest is not just a bunch of trees put together. A forest is a full ecosystem and these ecosystems are suffering. Sometimes because of climate change, because you can't have the same vegetation. If one degree difference can make a huge difference for certain vegetations, it's affecting our forests. But biodiversity is also under huge strains, so we need a plan to reinvigorate the health of our forests. That's a long term plan, that's not something you do in 1, 10 or even 30 years. It's about decades and decades of sustainable forest management. We have some Member States with a lot of experience in this and we love to work with them on that. But these Member States should also embrace the issue that part of the solution needs to be protecting biodiversity. Biodiversity cannot be ignored in this and I hope we can work on that on that basis.\nOn the ETS reform, now I have to insist on this and very quickly Madame President, I know we're running out of time, but it's an important point. We've set in law that Europe wants to be climate neutral in 2050 and wants to reduce its emissions with at least 55% in comparison to our emissions in 1990. So we have nine years to take us from the initial goal, which was a reduction of 40%, to the new goal, which is a reduction of 55%. This is set in law.\nThen you translate that into measures and that's what we will do when we present it on the 14th of July. If you don't like one measure, for instance, if you wouldn't like the potential extension of ETS to the built environment and transport, then you will have to tell us, if you don't like that, where are you going to get the results then? And how? The ETS has the effect of immediately influencing behavior. You see it in the industry already. The advantage of ETS is you can make money if you reduce your emissions. If you don't introduce ETS, but you introduce taxation or regulation that doesn't have that immediate effect on behavioral change. So you need to weigh the different options we have. You can't say ‘well if I don't like the options, then forget about the minus 55%.' No. We've said that, and all Member States have subscribed to that.\nIf you don't like the elements, well then come with other elements and we'll talk about it. But the thing is, if we can organize it in a way that protects those who are vulnerable, then this is a good way forward. And it it isn't, we will find another way. But we can't just neglect the issue. We have to address it, it is extremely important. Industry can help here, because industry has experienced with ETS and actually, it's quite popular. The price has gone up and it leads to adaptation, sometimes difficult adaptation, but if we combine it with other measures such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in sectors where it is needed, it could really help.\nFisheries was mentioned, and let me say that fisheries in some aspects is interesting, because the yearly discussion about taxing quota is actually telling the fishing industry that you need to live within the boundaries the oceans are setting. And if you don't respect the boundaries, the ocean is going to punish you by being depleted of the resources you need.\nActually, it's symbolic for what we need to do with climate crisis as well. This is the biggest task humanity has arguably ever had, especially in modern times: to learn to live within planetary boundaries. If we don't learn to live within planetary boundaries, and we have 10 billion people that all want to live like us in the future, the planet will not support us.  But this is not about saving the planet, ladies and gentlemen, the planet is been around for more than 3 billion years without humanity and it could be around for another 3 billion years without us. This is about saving humanity, this is about giving humanity a place on the planet. I like the expression ‘if we attack nature, nature will fight back'. And that's exactly what's happening. So we really need to be fully aware of that.\nOn the issue on farming: we're in the middle of negotiations now, with the Council and the European Parliament, on reforming the CAP. We need to reform the CAP. Look at what is happening, we're overusing fertilizers, overusing pesticides, we're overmedicating animals and animal husbandry. It has it a horrible effect on biodiversity. There is a possibility to have a sustainable agriculture, I strongly believe in that. And yes, we will need to feed 10 billion people, that's a huge opportunity for the agricultural sector, but only when we can do it within planetary boundaries. It is possible with the latest technologies, with a different way of looking at what you reward farmers for, etcetera. It is all possible to do that. We need to start reforming the CAP. The Commission is very much on the line to try and find a compromise this month with the co-legislators to see that we can push the envelope towards a greener Common Agricultural Policy. And as Mr Healy knows very well, the USDA report has been analysed and found faulty on many aspects, but he knows that.\nCBAM, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechamism. It must be WTO conform, we want to make it like that, only for sectors where it is needed and only when it is needed. When is it needed? When other signatories of the Paris agreement do not take the decarbonising measures that we need to comply with the rules. Then we want a level playing field. We want to avoid carbon leakage from Europe, then we will need this instrument.\nWe need to reform our commercial policies. We're in the middle of doing that. I had, again with the climate minister of New Zealand, this morning a discussion about that things are really changing in international trade. But we will still need international trade. But we will need a different international trade. The idea that we could sort of create a fortress Europe and liberate ourselves with all the issues of trade, please don't fall into that trap. Our economy will depend also on international trade, even a sustainable economy. But it has to be a fairer trade, it has to be a trade where we create a level playing field, also for decarbonising our economy and making it healthier. And that's what we're working on with our international trading partners.\nDeforestation is a huge issue in this, we have an incredible problem there and it's linked also to our consumption. It's linked to the way we produce. I want European consumers to see with labeling when they buy something that it's been created with deforestation. But ideally, I just want us not to have products that lead to deforestation. Sometimes it's indirect. Animal feed, for instance. We have a huge problem in that. America, the Amazon, in central Africa and in Southeast Asia and we absolutely need to address it.\nOn the taxonomy very quickly. What is green is green and what isn't green isn't green, I can't change that. It's a scientific fact. Nuclear energy is very good in terms of having no emissions, but it ain't green. Natural gas is much better in terms of emissions than coal, but it ain't green. It's something that I can't change. Does that mean that there's not going to be investment in nuclear, not going to be investment in natural gas? Of course there's going to be investments there. But we can't say it's green.\nYou shouldn't overstate the case of taxonomy, but you should be clear about taxonomy. And on this, let me be very clear. Natural gas will be absolutely essential in the transition away from coal and wood to sustainable. We're not going to be able to help all our Member States to immediately go from what they're doing now, coal and wood, immediately to renewables. There has to be a transitional period and natural gas will play a role in that. If you make the investments in such a way that the network you create, the system you create is pre-fitted to then later on transport and distribute sustainable energy carries, such as hydrogen. Then you invest also in the future. But we have to avoid getting locked eternally into carbon fuels.\nMadame President, I think I really overstayed my welcome now, let me stop immediately and I'm happy to be back at some point to continue our discussion, thank you very much.",

        "title": "The Commission proposes the next generation of EU own resources",
        "date": "Dec 22, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The Commission has today proposed to establish the next generation of own resources for the EU budget by putting forward three new sources of revenue: the first based on revenues from emissions trading (ETS), the second drawing on the resources generated by the proposed EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, and the third based on the share of residual profits from multinationals that will be re-allocated to EU Member States under the recent OECD/G20 agreement on a re-allocation of taxing rights (“Pillar One”). At cruising speed, in the years 2026-2030, these new sources of revenue are expected to generate on average a total of up to €17 billion annually for the EU budget.\nThe new own resources proposed today will help to repay the funds raised by the EU to finance the grant component of NextGenerationEU. The new own resources should also finance the Social Climate Fund. The latter is an essential element of the proposed new Emissions Trading System covering buildings and road transport, and will contribute to ensuring that the transition to a decarbonised economy will leave no one behind.\nJohannesHahn, Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, said:“With today's package, we lay the foundations for the repayment of NextGenerationEU and provide essential support to the Fit for 55 package by putting in place the financing of the Social Climate Fund. With the set of new own resources, we, therefore, ensure that the next generation will truly benefit from NextGenerationEU.”\nToday's proposal builds on the Commission's commitment undertaken as part of the political agreement on the 2021-2027 long-term budget and the NextGenerationEU recovery instrument. Once adopted, this package will strengthen the reform of the revenue system started in 2020 with the inclusion of the non-recycled plastic waste-based own resources.\nEU emissions trading\nThe Fit for 55 package of July 2021 aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990, to stay on track to reach climate neutrality by 2050. This package includes a revision of the EU Emissions Trading System. In future, emissions trading will also apply to the maritime sector, auctioning of aviation allowances will increase, and a new system for buildings and road transport will be established.\nUnder the current EU Emissions Trading System, most revenues from the auctioning of emission allowances are transferred to national budgets. Today, the Commission proposes that in future, 25% of the revenue from EU emissions trading flows into the EU budget. At cruising speed, revenues for the EU budget are estimated at around €12 billion per year on average over 2026-2030 (€9 billion on average between 2023-2030).\nIn addition to the repayment of NextGenerationEU funds, these new revenues would finance the Social Climate Fund, put forward by the Commission in July 2021. This Fund will ensure a socially fair transition and support vulnerable households, transport users and micro-enterprises to finance investments in energy efficiency, new heating and cooling systems and cleaner mobility, as well as, when appropriate, temporary direct income support. The total financial envelope of the Fund in principle corresponds to an amount equivalent to around 25% of the expected revenue from the new emissions trading system for buildings and road transport.\nCarbon border adjustment mechanism\nThe objective of the carbon border adjustment mechanism, which the Commission also proposed in July 2021, is to reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non-EU countries to green their production processes. It will put a carbon price on imports, corresponding to what would have been paid, had the goods been produced in the EU. This mechanism will apply to a targeted selection of sectors and is fully consistent with WTO rules.\nThe Commission proposes to allocate to the EU budget 75% of the revenues generated by this carbon border adjustment mechanism.Revenues for the EU budget are estimated at around €1 billion per year on average over 2026-2030 (€0.5 billion on average between 2023-2030).CBAM is not expected to generate revenue in the transitional period from 2023 to 2025.\nReform of the international corporate taxation framework\nOn 8 October 2021, more than 130 countries that are members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agreed on a reform of the international tax framework: a two-pillar solution to tackle tax avoidance and aims at ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activity and value creation occur. The signatory countries representing more than 90% of global GDP. Pillar One of this agreement will reallocate the right to tax a share of so-called residual profits from the world's largest multinational enterprises to participating countries worldwide. The Commission proposes an own resource equivalent to 15% of the share of the residual profits of in-scope companiesthat are reallocated to EU Member States.\nThe Commission has committed to propose a Directive in 2022, once the details of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement on Pillar One are finalised, implementing the Pillar One agreement in line with the requirements of the Single Market. This process is complementary to the Pillar Two Directive for which the Commission adopted a separate proposal today. Pending the finalisation of the agreement, revenues for the EU budget could amount to roughly between €2.5 and €4 billion per year.\nLegislative process\nIn order to incorporate these new own resources in the EU budget, the EU needs to amend two key pieces of legislation:\nFirst, the Commission proposes to amend the Own Resources Decision to add the three proposed new resources to the existing ones.\nSecondly, the Commission also puts forward a targeted amendment of the regulation on the current long-term EU budget 2021-2027, also known as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF Regulation). This amendment offers the legal possibility to start repaying the borrowing for NextGenerationEU already during the current MFF. At the same time, it proposes to increase the relevant MFF expenditure ceilings for the years 2025-2027 to accommodate the additional expenditure for the Social Climate Fund.\nThe Own Resources Decision needs to be approved unanimously in Council after consulting the European Parliament. The decision can enter into force once it is approved by all EU countries in line with their constitutional requirements. The MFF Regulation needs to be adopted unanimously by the Council after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.\nNext Steps\nThe European Commission will now work hand in hand with the European Parliament and the Council towards swift implementation of the package within the timelines set in the interinstitutional agreement.\nFurthermore, the Commission will present a proposal for a second basket of new own resources by the end of 2023. This second package will build on the 'Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT)' proposal foreseen for 2023.\nBackground\nAs an answer to the unprecedented pandemic challenge, the European Union agreed in 2020 on a record stimulus package of more than €2 trillion – boosting the long-term budget with more than €800 billionfirepower of the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU (in current prices).\nWith NextGenerationEU, the Commission has been enabled to issue bonds on a large scalebacked by the EU budget. That means the Union can incur debt supporting all Member States to fight the crisis and build resilience. To help repay the borrowing, the EU institutions agreed to introduce new own resources as this would allow more diversified and resilient types of revenue, directly related to our common political priorities. New own resources will avoid that NextGenerationEU repayments lead to undue cuts to EU programmes or excessive increases in Member States contributions.\nIn 2021, the Commission has raised €71 billion (in current prices) via long-term bonds and currently has €20 billion of short-term EU-Bills outstanding under a sovereign-style diversified funding strategy.\n[All prices are quoted in 2018 prices unless stated otherwise.]\nFor More Information\nQ&A\nFactsheet\nLegal acts\nRevenue | European Commission (europa.eu)",

        "title": "Questions and answers on the Clean Industrial Deal",
        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The EU must urgently address three challenges at once: the climate change, competitiveness and dependency on critical raw materials.\nDecarbonisation is crucial to address these challenges. As the Draghi Report highlights, decarbonisation policies are a powerful driver of growth when they are well integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. This is why Europe needs a transformational business plan bringing together climate, circularity and competitiveness under one overarching growth strategy.\nCompetitive manufacturers drive innovation, quality-job creation and open strategic autonomy, but businesses need to be certain that large climate neutral investments in energy intensive industries and clean tech will be profitable. This is why the Clean Industrial Deal aims at creating the right conditions for the industry to invest and produce in the EU, namely by driving down energy prices and boosting demand for clean products.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal is a business plan thatmakes decarbonisation achievable and profitable for industry in Europe. It commits to accelerate decarbonisation, promote the circular economy and support re-industrialisation, as sources of growth and prosperity across the entire continent. The Deal offers companies long-term predictability on our climate ambition, so that they can invest and minimise investment risks.\nThe Deal focuses mainly on two interlinked sectors:\nThe Deal makescircularity a priority. It is key to make the best possible use of the EU's limited resources, reduce dependencies on scarce materials and enhance resilience. It reduces waste, production costs, and CO2 emissions while creating a more sustainable and competitive industrial model that benefits the environment.\nEurope has set the ambitious target to become a decarbonised economy by 2050. It will stay the course on the objectives of theEuropean Green Deal, with the achievement of the 55%net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductionagreed for 2030, and through an intermediate2040 target of 90%.\nEspecially in an unstable world, the EU's regulatory certainty and predictability, in combination with simplified rules, is a great asset to attract investments. The actions we have taken so far are already yielding results: we are decarbonising rapidly, reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels and tackling pollution of the environment. This Deal positions decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth and prosperity for Europeans.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal supports industry to growth and prosper, looking at the entire value chain. It focuses on:\nThe Clean Industrial Deal sets out several legislative and regulatory initiatives to support European industries, such as:\nWind projects can last up to 7-10 years, distribution grid projects up to 8-10 years and transmission grid projects up to 17 years for. However, only 7 Member States use the more flexible permitting rules of the Renewable Energy Directive. The Commission calls on Member States to urgently use these new rules. The Commission will reinforce its support to Member States by sharing best practices and recommendations and launching an implementation dialogue on energy permitting.\nThe upcoming Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act will propose concrete measures to address permitting bottlenecks related to industrial access to energy and industrial decarbonisation, while maintaining environmental safeguards and protecting human health. Shorter deadlines for energy infrastructure will also lower energy costs.\nIt is important to ensure that the EU industry has better access to critical raw materials as they are essential for our industry to the clean and digital transitions. To do so, the Commission will prioritise the implementation of the Critical Raw Materials Act and identifya first list of Strategic Projects in March 2025to increase EU capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries. The Commission also proposes the creation of anEU Critical Raw Material Centreto jointly purchase raw materials with increased market power and to coordinate strategic stockpiles.\nMoreover, by placingcircularity at the core of our decarbonisation strategy, including with the future Circular Economy Act, the EU not only makes essential materials more affordable and accessible, but also reduces our dependencies, as materials are recovered, reused, recycled, and kept longer in the economy. The Commission will make sure that products containing valuable and scarce materials are (re-)used efficiently and as long as possible before they become waste, including through the full roll out of Ecodesign requirements.\nEU industry needs immediate access to capital. That is why the Clean Industrial Deal provides for (1) more EU-level funding, (2) leverage private investments and (3) enhance the effectiveness of State aid in support to the Deal objectives.\nTo provide short-term relief theClean Industrial Deal will mobilise over €100billion for EU-made clean manufacturing, including an additional€1 billionguarantees under the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). In the next EU budget, theCompetitiveness Fundplans to establish an investment capacity for European projects with the most EU added value along the entire investment journey - from research and innovation, through scale-up, industrial deployment, to manufacturing, including clean tech and industrial decarbonisation.\nThe Commission will propose anIndustrial Decarbonisation Bank, aiming for€100 billion in funding, based on available funds in the Innovation Fund, additional revenues resulting from parts of the ETS as well as the revision of InvestEU.\nPrior to the revision of the ETS Directive in 2026, the Commission will launch in 2025 a pilot with a€1 billionauction on the decarbonisation of key industrial processes across various sectors supporting industrial decarbonisation and electrification, using a combination of existing resources under the Innovation Fund and auctions-as-a-service.\nPublic funding will also come fromnational tax incentivesfor which the Commission will issue recommendations on common guidelines.\nIn addition, a flagship Horizon Europe call of ca.€600 millionwill be launched under the 2026-2027 work programme to support fit-for-deployment projects.\nPublic funds, however, will not suffice. The Commission will soon propose aEuropean Savings and Investments Union, including banking and capital markets. This will help leverage the enormous wealth of private savings in Europe to invest in innovation and the clean and digital transitions.\nAs part of the Clean Industrial Deal, the Commission will adopt anew Clean Industrial Deal State aid frameworkby June 2025to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy, deploy industrial decarbonisation and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity of clean tech. A survey conducted by the Commission showed that the Member States need more flexibility to support decarbonisation.\nThe new Framework will make it easier for Member States to give aid, by simplifying State aid rules while preserving a level playing field.\nThe Commission will also reflect on a further simplification of the State aid rules to prioritise work on the most distortive aid measures and accelerate authorisations of compatible aid. This includes the speeding up of proposals for new Important Projects of Common European Interest, and a revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation by 2027.\nFor More Information\nTheClean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for decarbonisation and competitiveness\nPress release\nFactsheet\nQuestions and answerson the Action Plan on Affordable Energy\nAudiovisual Service",

        "date": "Dec 12, 2024",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen,\nGood morning everybody,\nIt's a great pleasure to be here with all of you today.\nI've seen the programme – it's extremely packed.\nYou have an amazing line-up for this conference with MEPs, industry leaders, innovators, academics. A very warm welcome to each and every one of you.\nWe're here in one of the most beautiful places in all of Brussels, the Palais d'Egmont.\nWhen I'm here, I'm always struck by the notion that Europe is sometimes referred to as ‘the museum of the world'.\nIt's true – we have a rich cultural heritage that we're proud to preserve and showcase.\nLook more closely, however.\nThis building has been restored and reimagined for the 21stCentury.\nJust like this Palace blends old and new, Europe has always been a union of tradition and innovation.\nToday, as we drive clean growth, innovation, and a more sustainable future, this is more crucial than ever.\nOver the past few months, I've been listening closely to concerns of Europeans from all walks of life – and two clear messages emerge:\nFirst, many of our citizens are deeply worried about the future of our planet and the impact of the climate crisis on their daily lives.\nThey have valid questions.\nWill my children and grandchildren be able to live on a planet with rising sea levels?\nHow will we deal with more frequent and extreme weather events?\nSecond, it sounds like a contradiction but at best it's a paradox: they're worried about the cost of living and climate policies, and how they will affect their lives and businesses.\nWill I be able to pay my bills at the end of the month?\nWill my business grow in a rapidly changing economy with ever increasing demands?\nThat is why, for this Commission, and for me, as the one responsible for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, we clearly need to bridge and to marry these two areas.\nWe urgently need to address the climate crisis, make Europe climate resilient and better prepared for climate risks.\nWe also urgently need to unlock new markets, new opportunities, and new sources of growth.\nIn my view, and I said it many times before, it's not a question of either / or.\nWe can – and should – do both.\nThe EU has always led the charge on climate change. We have to make sure we continue to do so.\nBut we must harness the momentum of the green transition to fuel net zero growth, create jobs, stimulate innovation, and propel EU competitiveness to new and higher grounds.\nThis is the reasoning behind the Clean Industrial Deal, which the Commission will bring forward in the first 100 days.\nThe countdown is on since the 1stDecember.\nIt's currently in the making. I won't be able to say that much about it yet.\nBut I'll use the opportunity today to give you a sense of where, in my view, we should be heading.\nI'll briefly talk about four key topics:\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nFirst on finance.\nWe already have a strong foundation for a decarbonised and competitive industry.\nThe EU ETS puts a price on pollution.\nIt also generates billions in revenue each year to finance clean industrial investments.\nJust to give you a figure:\nLast year alone, Member States received around EUR 38 billion from the ETS.\nOn top of that, thanks to CBAM, imports are going to be charged the same carbon price as EU products.\nWe'll prevent carbon leakage and further drive decarbonisation.\nWhile this is all great news, it still dwarfs our financial needs.\nThe constant oversubscription of the Innovation Fund is a clear sign that there's a stronger demand for financing.\nThis is why the Clean Industrial Deal must unlock more resources.\nWe need to de-risk industrial projects with a range of financial instruments.\nAnd we need to tap into private capital especially venture capital and private equity, where there is huge growth potential in Europe.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThis brings me to my second point.\nAs we speak, high energy costs are a huge drag on Europe's competitiveness.\nWe have higher energy costs than most other competitive regions.\nWe still rely on fossil fuels imported from outside the EU.\nThat makes it harder for many of our companies to keep production costs down and compete on price.\nThis is why we need more renewable energy – and we need it quickly – to meet the growing demand for affordable, clean power and drive down prices.\nAnd that is why the Clean Industrial Deal must unleash the potential of tools like Power Purchase Agreements and long-term contracts.\nAlongside this, we'll have to be serious about investing in our grids and infrastructure.\nYesterday I was talking to people who are active in the recharging industry of cars.\nThey can put the loading infrastructure in place.\nBut they were describing in vivid terms that the next bottleneck will be the grid in many places in Europe.\nSo it's the next thing we need to solve.\nIf we don't, we won't be able to integrate all the additional technology that we have available into our system.\nSo we have to think about how we strive for more of a single market approach, one which encourages cooperation between Member States and prioritises investments.\nThird, some sectors, like the hard-to-abate industries, will require targeted action to support their decarbonisation efforts.\nIn some sectors, it's more difficult than others because of where we stand in terms of technology.\nTo address this, in my view, the Clean Industrial Deal should identify priority sectors for lead markets, paving the way for public support mechanisms at EU and national level.\nThis will stimulate investment and drive demand for green products.\nOf course, if you do that, you will need to ensure a reliable and standardised approach to certification.\nConsumers need to be able to trust the environmental credentials of what they're paying for.\nThis will be the only way to make sure there is value for money for the things we do with taxpayers money.\nFourth and final point:\nElectrification is clearly very important.\nBut the reality is that some industries will continue to emit carbon and use CO2 in the future.\nOur Industrial Carbon Management strategy published last February outlines the next steps to manage carbon more sustainably.\nBut in my view, we'll need to go further if we are to achieve net zero objectives.\nThis means clarifying the rules and encouraging carbon capture.\nIt means developing transport and CO2 storage infrastructures needed to decarbonise our industry.\nAnd it means finalising the framework for nature-based solutions such as carbon sinks, carbon farming and the bioeconomy.\nDear friends,\nBefore I leave, one last word on competition.\nI'm still of the school that competition truly is a good thing.\nIt focuses the minds.\nIt motivates people and business to push the boundaries of what's possible.\nIt drives innovation.\nAnd it offers consumers better quality for better prices.\nAll this benefits individuals and societies and it has brought us in many ways to where we are today.\nBut it is absolutely essential for our companies that competition, in our European geography, is good and fair.\nAnd it means that we need to act more rigorously if competition is unfair. If products are being heavily state-supported and being flooded into our marketplace.\nSo we will need to make sure, also as part of the Clean Industrial Deal, that we do more in terms of enhancing the level playing field.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nAt the start of my remarks, I spoke about how climate and economy are weighing on people's minds.\nRightly so.\nThese are geopolitical times filled with uncertainty and volatility.\nAnd my view is that we've already seen the beginning of a geopolitical winter.\nAnd yet at the same time, I'm hopeful – because there is no place quite like the European Union.\nYes, we have beautiful buildings, amazing history, and culture, like this palace.\nBut as I said, the EU has always been a place where we marry tradition with renewal and innovation.\nWe have roots and we have wings.\nSo let's build on that.\nLet's make sure that we put our dynamism, and our great assets – the largest single market in the world, a highly educated and skilled workforce – right at the centre of our policies.\nBecause then truly everything is possible.\nThank you.",

        "title": "State of the Union: Commission adopts revised EU Emission Trading System State aid Guidelines*",
        "date": "Sep 21, 2020",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "In line with theEuropean Green Dealand the EU's objective to become the first climate neutral economy by 2050, the Commission adopted today revisedEU Emission Trading System State aid Guidelinesin the context of the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading post-2021 (the “ETS Guidelines”). They will enter into force on 1 January 2021 with the start of the new ETS trading period, and replace the previous Guidelines adopted in 2012.\nExecutive Vice-President MargretheVestager, in charge of competition policy, said:“To sustainably tackle climate change and achieve our Green Deal objectives, we have to put a price tag on carbon emissions while avoiding carbon leakage. The revised EU Emission Trading System State aid Guidelines adopted today are an important element of this project. They enable Member States to support those sectors that, because of indirect emission costs, are most at risk of carbon leakage. At the same time,they help deliver on a cost-effective decarbonisation of the economy by avoiding overcompensation and undue distortions of competitionin the Single Market”.\nEU State aid control has an important role to play in enabling Europe to fulfil its Green Deal objectives. In order to reap the full benefits of limited public funds, it is crucial that State aid rules continue to do their part. This means ensuring that public money does not crowd out private spending and maintaining a level playing field in the Single Market, while minimising costs for taxpayers.\nThe ETS Guidelines aim at reducing the risk of “carbon leakage”, where companies move production to countries outside the EU with less ambitious climate policies, leading to less economic activity in the EU and no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions globally. In particular, they enable Member States to compensate companies in at-risk sectors for part of the higher electricity prices resulting from the carbon price signals created by the EU ETS (so-called “indirect emission costs”). At the same time, overcompensation of companies would risk running counter to the price signals created by the EU ETS to promote a cost-effective decarbonisation of the economy and create undue distortions of competition in the Single Market.\nAgainst this background, the revised ETS Guidelines will:\nThe Guidelines also take into account the specificities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in line with theSME Strategy for a sustainable and digital Europe, by exempting them from the new conditionality requirement in order to limit their administrative burden.\nThe Commission has completed an extensive evaluation and Impact Assessment, in line with theBetter Regulation Guidelines, with the support of an external consultant. In this context, the Commission has conducted numerous consultations, including apublic consultationbased on a questionnaire and a targeted consultation to gather the input of interested sectors. The Commission also sought the views of relevant stakeholders on a proposal of revised Guidelines in apublic consultationopen from 14 January to 10 March 2020. All details about the public consultation are availableonline.\nThe new Guidelines, the Impact Assessment Report and all supporting documents are availablehere.\nThe Commission is also in the process of evaluating and reviewing other State aid guidelines, including the Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines, to make sure they are fully aligned with the Commission's green and digital objectives.\nBackground\nIn December 2019, the European Commission presented theEuropean Green Deal,  a roadmap for making the EU's economy sustainable and achieve climate neutrality by 2050 by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities across all policy areas and making the transition just and inclusive for all.\nThe EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU's policy to combat climate change and a key tool for curbing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. Set up in 2005, the ETS is the world's first major carbon market and remains the biggest one. It operates in all 27 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The United Kingdom is part of the EU ETS until the end of the transition period. Pursuant to the Ireland/Northern Protocol, the EU ETS will apply to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland insofar as it applies to the generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity, trading in wholesale electricity or cross-border exchanges in electricity. By putting a price on carbon, it delivers concrete results for the environment: the European Union is already on track to meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2020.\nLast week, the Commission put forward aplanto further cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030. By June 2021, the Commission will also review and, where necessary, propose to revise all relevant policy instruments, including the EU ETS Directive, to deliver additional greenhouse gas emissions reductions.\nFollowing the review of climate-related policy instruments, including the initiative for the creation of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the Commission will check whether any revision or adaptation of the ETS Guidelines is necessary to ensure consistency with, and contribute to, the fulfilment of the climate neutrality objective while respecting a level playing field.\nFor more information\nFactsheet\nState of the Union webpage\n* modified 21/09/2020, 17h30",

This will give adequate time for businesses to prepare in a predictable manner, while also allowing for the definitive methodology to be fine-tuned by 2026.\nTo help both importers and third country producers, the Commission also published todayguidancefor EU importers and non-EU installations on the practical implementation of the new rules. At the same time, dedicated IT tools to help importers perform and report these calculations are currently being developed, as well as training materials, webinars and tutorials to support businesses when the transitional mechanism begins.

Presidentvon der Leyencalled the agreement reached“an enormous achievement” and “a European investment in our European Union”.“I believeNextGenerationEUcan be one of the largest stimulus for investment and reforms anywhere in the world – investing in roll out 5G, grid infrastructure, in AI and industrial digitisation, in renewables, sustainable transport, energy efficient buildings. This is how we fight climate change and modernise!”The President emphasised that the European Parliament will play its full role:“This House will have its full say on the design of the Facility and how it works. The Commission will ensure full transparency.”The President also praised the agreement on new own resources:“We have a clear timetable and we have them linked to repayment. This is a huge and historic step for our Union – which both the Commission and the Parliament have long been pushing for. We have no time to waste. The Commission will come forward with a package of new own resources.”Highlighting the importance of protecting our values, and in particular the rule of Law, the President announced:“We will look into our 2018 rule of law proposal. We will work together with the co-legislators to ensure that our 2018 proposal is taken forward and where necessary, improved.”While regretting the adjustments made to some programmes –“There are regrettable and painful decisions on many programmes, which have crucial European added value”– Presidentvon der Leyenemphasised that“we now have a massive and unprecedented financial firepower. €1.8 trillion.We should not lose sight of this bigger picture.”Finally, the President underlined the importance of staying united in the response to this crisis:“We now have the chance to achieve something historic for Europe. The pressure of the crisis has opened doors which had long been closed. As sad as the occasion is, this is also an opportunity for Europe, for our community. NextGenerationEU is a great sign of solidarity. Because NextGenerationEU is based on the community method, it will help heal wounds and bring us together.

The study, for the first time taking into account the impact of digital developments, looks at physical and digital threats and attacks on journalists, their working conditions but also issues such as market plurality, political independence and social inclusiveness. Vice-President of the Commission for Values and Transparency,VěraJourová,said: “This study is a wake-up call. We need to better protect journalists and to increase transparency and fairness in the online world, especially in the context of political campaigning. We also need to support the media sector, which has been heavily hit by the COVID-19 crisis, while respecting its independence. The Commission can't win this fight alone: I rely on Member States to help reverse this trend”.Commissioner for the Internal Market, ThierryBreton,said:“The Media Pluralism Monitor highlights the opportunities brought by digital transformation, which media must seize, but also challenges – from the potential gatekeeping role of online platforms to the digital safety of journalists and media workers. As the coronavirus crisis further accelerates these trends, we will tackle them in a holistic way to foster the recovery of the media ecosystem.”The findings of the study are an important source of information for the first Rule of Law Report, scheduled for September, which will specifically address media pluralism. They will also feed into the European Democracy Action Plan (public consultation ongoing), the Media and Audiovisual Action Plan and the Digital Services Act (public consultation ongoing), all to be presented later this year. The Media Pluralism Monitor is co-funded by the EU, as part of a series of projects to support media pluralism and freedom detailed in thisfactsheet. In addition, today the Commission has also made available astudyon the abusive use of defamation laws (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation - SLAPPs) which threatens the work of journalists. This study and the feedback to be collected on SLAPPs under the public consultation on the European Democracy Action Plan, will help guide the Commission's action in this area.(For more information: Johannes Bahrke – Tel.: +32 229 58615;Christian Wigand- Tel.: +32 229 62253 Charles Manoury – Tel.: +32 229 13391; Alice Hobbs - Tel.: +32 229 80829).\nTaxation and the European Green Deal: Commission launches public consultations on Energy Taxation Directive and a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nThe European Commission has today launched public consultations on two initiatives that aim to maximise the role of taxation in meeting the EU's climate goals: the revision of the Energy Tax Directive (ETD) and the creation of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Both were identified in the European Green Deal as a means to help with Europe's transition towards a greener and more sustainable economy. In addition, the Commission'sRecovery Plan for Europeproposed new own resources (such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) that could contribute to financing the EU's future budget and play a role in easing the burden on Member States in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. New own resources, including the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, were referred to in theEuropean Council Conclusions of 21 July. PaoloGentiloni, Commissioner for the Economy, said:“Europe must use taxation to deliver on its climate goals in a socially just way. The Energy Taxation Directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will be a key part of our work. That is why we are launching these two public consultations today: we want to hear from Europeans and all interested parties on what these rules should look like. We need to ensure that our taxation rules are able to help Europe to both recover from the coronavirus crisis and accelerate its green transition to a climate-neutral continent.”The revision of the Energy Taxation Directive should overhaul the way in which energy products (such as electricity, natural gas and coal) are taxed in the EU, to better reflect the EU's climate ambitions. This includes revising minimum rates for fuels and re-thinking current tax exemptions, to reduce implicit subsidies for fossil fuels and certain economic sectors. The aim is to re-shape energy taxation in a way that encourages consumers and businesses to behave in a more environmentally way. In parallel, in view of the EU's increased climate ambition, a WTO-compliant Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism – applied to certain sectors – would help to reduce the risk of carbon leakage and deter companies from shifting production to countries with less stringent green regulations. All citizens and interested parties are invited to share their views on both initiatives via two separate public consultationshereandhere.(For more information: Daniel Ferrie – Tel.: 32 229 86500; Aikaterini Apostola – Tel.: +32 229 87624)\nPlan d'action pour l'Atlantique 2.0: Une stratégie maritime repensée pour favoriser une économie bleue durable dans le cadre du Pacte vert européen\nAujourd'hui, la Commission européenne a adopté unPlan d'action actualisé pour une économie bleue durable, résiliente et compétitive dans la zone atlantique de l'UE, couvrant la France, l'Irlande, le Portugal et l'Espagne. Le plan d'action remanié donnera un nouvel élan à la stratégie maritime atlantique et renforcera les efforts de relance des pays participants. Il contribuera auPacte vert européen, tout en préservant les environnements marins et côtiers et en garantissant un océan sain. Le commissaire chargé de l'environnement, des océans et de la pêche, VirginijusSinkevičius, a déclaré:« Au milieu de la crise, plus que jamais, nous devons rester concentrés sur le fait de rendre notre avenir vert: le Pacte vert européen et la transition verte devraient guider notre plan de relance. Le développement d'une économie bleue durable, ciblant des défis et des opportunités spécifiques au niveau des bassins maritimes, sert exactement ces objectifs. Nous devons mettre le vert dans le bleu et le bleu dans le vert. »Le nouveau plan d'action propose des actions concrètes pour le développement de l'économie bleue dans l'Atlantique, en répondant à des défis tels que la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et le développement des énergies renouvelables, la lutte contre la pollution marine, la création d'emplois et l'adaptation au changement climatique. Les principales sources de financement comprendront lesFonds structurels et d'investissement européenset leFonds européen pour les affaires maritimes et la pêche (FEAMP), ainsi que d'autres sources européennes, nationales et régionales. Un cadre de suivi solide en mesurera le progrès et l'impact.(Pour plus d'informations:Tim McPhie – Tél.: +32 229 58602; Sara Soumillion – Tél.: +32 229 67094)\nCommerce agricole:  un démarrage fort en premier trimestre suivi d'un ralentissement dû à la crise du coronavirus\nLe commerce agricole de l'UE-27 a connu un certain ralentissement en avril 2020 dans le contexte de la crise du coronavirus. Les exportations et les importations ont enregistré respectivement des baisses de 9 % et de 5 %, en retombant en-dessous du niveau du mois précèdent. Toutefois, les chiffres pour l'ensemble du commerce agricole des 27 sur les premiers 4 mois de 2020 (l'export et l'import compris) ont dépassé de 3,8 % celles de la même période de 2019 et ont atteint la valeur de €104,3 milliards. Les exportations agroalimentaires de l'UE s'élevaient sur cette période à €61,9 milliards (une hausse de 4,8 % par rapport à la même période de 2019) et les importations à €4,4 milliards (une hausse de 2,3 %).

Stakeholders can respond to the consultation until 30 September 2020. The Regional Aid Guidelines aim to promote the economic development of disadvantaged regions in the EU, while ensuring a level playing field between Member States. Regional aid is an important instrument used by Member States to enhance regional development. The current Regional Aid Guidelines are under revision in the context of the Commission's “fitness check” of the2012 State aid modernisation package, which aims to evaluate if the current rules are still fit for purpose. The draft revised Guidelines take into account the preliminary results of the fitness check exercise. These preliminary results show that the current Regional Aid Guidelines have worked well in principle. At the same time, the Commission is proposing a number of targeted adjustments to simplify and reflect experience gained from the application of the current rules. Furthermore, the draft revised Guidelines reflect new policy priorities related to theEuropean Green Dealand the EuropeanIndustrialandDigitalStrategy. For example, given the large investment needs for the twin transition, and to enable regions to bounce back from the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak, the Commission is proposing to increase maximum aid intensities by enabling additional incentives for private investments in the most disadvantaged regions, while ensuring a level playing field between Member States. The Commission is also proposing additional procedural simplifications for State aid toJust Transition Areasthat Member States are in the process of defining. As part of its ongoing review of State aid rules, the Commission continues to reflect on additional measures in State aid enforcement that can contribute to the achievement of the Green Deal objectives, which must be based on clear and objective criteria. As part of today's consultation on the draft revised Regional Aid Guidelines, the Commission is also inviting stakeholders for views on this issue. The draft Guidelines and all details about the public consultation are availableonline. Executive Vice-President MargretheVestager, in charge of competition policy, said:“The Regional Aid Guidelines aim to promote the economic development of disadvantaged regions in the EU, while ensuring a level playing field between Member States. Regional aid is an important instrument used by Member States to enhance regional development. Today, we invite stakeholders to comment on our draft revised Guidelines which, besides the objective of regional development, will also support the twin transition to a green and digital economy.”(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel. +32 229 87024; Maria Tsoni – Tel.: +32 229 90526)\nState aid: Commission approves €148 million Danish scheme to compensate companies for damages still suffered due to coronavirus outbreak\nThe European Commission has approved under EU State aid rules a DKK 1.1 billion (approximately €148 million) Danish scheme to compensate damages suffered by companies in the tourism and travel-related sectors. The scheme will be open to companies active in those sectors and whose activities are still affected by previous border closure and travel restrictions that have now been lifted, or by the remaining border and travel related measures implemented by the Danish government to limit the spread of the virus. Under the scheme, such companies, which have a documented decline in turnover of more than 35% because of the coronavirus outbreak, will be entitled to compensation for the damage they suffer. This will be applicable for the period between 8 July to 31 August 2020 compared to a reference period before the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, they will receive a compensation in the form of a partial or full coverage of the fixed costs that they continue to bear. The Danish authorities foresee several levels of compensation according to the level of turnover decline. The maximum aid amount per company is DKK 60 million (approximately €8 million). The Danish authorities will carry out ex-post checks to ensure that the compensation does not exceed the actual damage suffered. The public support in excess of the actual damage received by the beneficiaries will have to be paid back to the Danish State. The Commission found that the scheme is in line with Article107(2)(b)of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which enables the Commission to approve State aid measures granted by Member States to compensate specific companies or specific sectors for the damages directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as the coronavirus outbreak. The Commission found that, in spite of the progressive reopening of the Danish society, the scheme will compensate damages that are still directly linked to the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent measures adopted by the Danish government. It also found that the measure is proportionate, as the envisaged compensation does not exceed what is necessary to make good the damage. The Commission therefore concluded that the scheme is in line with EU State aid rules. More information on the actions taken by the Commission to address the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic can be found here. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.57932 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetition websiteonce any confidentiality issues have been resolved.(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel. +32 229 87024; Maria Tsoni – Tel.: +32 229 90526)\nMergers: Commission clears the acquisition of joint control over Smith & Williamson and Tilney by Permiraand Warburg Pincus\nThe European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed acquisition of joint control over Smith & Williamson Holdings Limited (“Smith & Williamson”) and Tilney Group Limited (\"Tilney\"), both of the UK, by Permira Holdings Limited (“Permira”) of Guernsey and Warburg Pincus LLC of the U.S. Smith & Williamson is an independent financial and professional services firm. Tilney is an independent wealth management firm, ultimately controlled by Permira. Permira is a private equity business engaged in the provision of investment management services to a number of investment funds. Warburg Pincus is a global private equity firm with portfolio companies active in a variety of sectors. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns given the limited horizontal and vertical overlaps between the activities of the companies. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure. More information is available on the Commission'scompetitionwebsite, in the publiccase registerunder the case numberM.9880.(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel. +32 229 87024; Maria Tsoni – Tel.: +32 229 90526)\nListe des points prévusà l'ordre du jour des prochaines réunions de la Commission\nVeuillez noter que ces informations sont données sous réserve de modifications.\nEurostat: communiqués de presse",

        "date": "11.04.2024",
        "location": "Berlin",
        "text": "Meine Damen und Herren!\nVielen Dank für die Einladung.\nEs ist mir eine große Freude, wieder in Berlin zu sein.\nIch war schon oft in Berlin, und erinnere mich sehr gerne an die Zeit, als ich selbst hier gelebt habe.\nEs ist mehr als zwanzig Jahre her, als ich in Prenzlauer Berg gewohnt habe. Regelmäßig fuhr ich nach Charlottenburg, um Sport zu machen.\nAuf das Thema Sport werde ich gleich noch zurückkommen.\nWährend dieser Jahre erlebte ich eine unglaubliche Gastfreundschaft und Freundlichkeit. Ich hatte das Privileg, viel über dieses Land und seine Menschen zu lernen.\nNeben den persönlichen Erfahrungen meiner jungen Jahre hatte ich auch eine sehr produktive Zusammenarbeit mit Ministerinnen und Ministern, Parlamentariern und vielen anderen hier in Deutschland, als ich Mitglied der Regierung der Niederlande war.\nUnd ich freue mich, dass diese Zusammenarbeit auch in meiner jetzigen Funktion als EU-Kommissar für Klimapolitik fortbestehen.\nHeute bin ich hier, um über die Herausforderung zu sprechen, unsere Klima-, Energie- und Wirtschaftspolitik miteinander zu verbinden.\nEs ist wichtig, dass wir eine Bestandsaufnahme machen, wo wir stehen, und wohin wir gehen.\nIch habe versprochen, dass ich auf das Thema Sport zurückkommen werde.\nNun, das liegt daran, dass ich diese Rede ein wenig wie die Aussprache mit der Mannschaft während der Halbzeitpause nutzen möchte.\nIch hoffe, es sind hier genug Fußballfans im Saal!\nMit Blick auf die Fußballeuropameisterschaft werden Sie mir das nachsehen.\nWarum ein Teamgespräch in der Halbzeit? Weil wir uns mit dem grünen Übergang gerade dort befinden.\nUnd weil einige von uns eine Gedächtnisstütze brauchen, was wir in der ersten Halbzeit erreicht haben und wie wir in der zweiten Halbzeit den Sieg sicherstellen können.\nWas haben wir also bisher erreicht?\nMit dem Green Deal haben wir Energie, Klima und Wirtschaft zusammengeführt. Wir haben dafür gesorgt, dass unser Klimaplan auch unser Wachstumsplan ist.\nIch muss einem deutschen Publikum nicht sagen, dass eine starke Mannschaft mit einer guten Abwehr beginnt.\nWir sind dabei, die Instrumente zu schaffen, die wir brauchen, um uns gegen die unvermeidlichen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels zu schützen.\nVor einigen Wochen hat die Europäische Umweltagentur einen Bericht veröffentlicht, der erstmals auf EU-Ebene einen Überblick über das Ausmaß und die Dringlichkeit von Klimarisiken gibt.\nWenn wir an Klimarisiken denken, denken wir in der Regel zuerst an Risiken für unsere Gesundheit, Infrastruktur und Ernährungssicherheit. Aber auch Wirtschaft und Finanzen sind stark betroffen.\nEs ist klar, dass Klima- und Umweltrisiken angegangen werden müssen, um die langfristige Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der EU-Wirtschaft zu sichern.\nDenken Sie an Unternehmen, die sich nach Klimaschäden nur schwer erholen können. Oder die Wasserknappheit, die ihre Produktion beeinträchtigt.\nDie Flut 2021 in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden-Württemberg, Bayern und Sachsen verursachte allein in Deutschland Schäden in Höhe von 33 Milliarden Euro. Es war die teuerste Naturkatastrophe seit langem in Europa. Man stelle sich vor, welche Investitionen mit dieser Summe hätten getätigt werden können.\nZweitens:  jeder Euro, der für das Klimarisikomanagement ausgegeben wird, spart zwischen 5 und 9 Euro in der Zukunft.\nUnsere Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber dem Klimawandel ist für die europäische Wirtschaft von entscheidender Bedeutung.\nMit unserer Klimaanpassungspolitik bauen wir also eine starke Verteidigung auf.\nAber der grüne Wandel bietet auch große Offensivchancen für unsere Unternehmen, Verbraucher, Investoren, Innovatoren und unsere gesamte Wirtschaft.\nWie sieht unsere Strategie für den Angriff aus?\nSie besteht aus einer Mischung, Emissionen zu senken - und damit die Ursachen des Klimawandels zu bekämpfen - und gleichzeitig, Erfolge für die europäische Industrie und die Bürger zu ermöglichen.\nDas europäische Klimagesetz war die erste Schlüsselinitiative im Rahmen des europäischen Green Deal. Es war unser erster Schritt.\nDas europäische Klimagesetz schafft die rechtlich verbindliche Grundlage für einen grünen Übergang, der gekoppelt ist an eine starke und stabile Wirtschaft, eine wettbewerbsfähige Industrie, die zukunftssichere Arbeitsplätze in Europa schaffen.\nIm Anschluss daran haben wir unser Fit-for-55-Paket beschlossen, um die Emissionen innerhalb der EU bis 2030 um mindestens 55 % zu senken.\nFür unsere Wirtschaft ist es wichtig, dass die Unternehmen wissen, wohin die Reise geht. Genau das bietet diese Gesetzgebung.\nWir befinden uns jetzt mitten in der Umsetzung, und das erfordert Maßnahmen von allen Beteiligten. Beispielsweise arbeiten die Mitgliedstaaten derzeit an ihren nationalen Energie- und Klimaplänen.\nDer grüne Übergang ist nun Teil der nationalen Planung und Haushalte.\nAuf EU-Ebene haben wir aber nicht bloß langfristige Ziele gesteckt.\nDie EU hat ein umfassendes Paket politischer Initiativen vorgelegt, die die Dekarbonisierung unterstützen und gleichzeitig die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit im Fokus haben.\nSo hat die Kommission im Februar 2023 den Green-Deal-Industrieplan angenommen. Er  umfasst das Gesetz über kritische Rohstoffe und das Gesetz über die Netto-Null-Industrie .\nDamit werden wir die Produktionskapazitäten für Netto-Null-Technologien und -Produkte, die unsere Wirtschaft braucht, ausbauen.\nDiese Art von regulatorischer Stabilität und Vorhersehbarkeit unterscheidet die EU von vielen anderen Ländern und Regionen der Welt, in denen die Bedingungen nicht so gut sind.\nParallel dazu arbeiten wir auch daran, dass wirklich niemand beim Übergang zurückgelassen wird und dass die Schwachen unterstützt werden.\nDer Just Transition Fund und der Klimasozialfonds sind gute Beispiele dafür.\nMit dem Innovationsfonds verfügen wir über ein leistungsfähiges Instrument, mit dem wir europaweit bis 2030 innovative Projekte mit rund 40 Milliarden Euro finanzieren werden.\nDer Innovationsfonds speist sich aus den Einnahmen des EU-Emissionshandelssystems.\nIm vergangenen Jahr wurden die Emissionen in den ETS-Sektoren so stark gesenkt wie noch nie seit seiner Einführung im Jahr 2005. Warum ist das so? Weil der Stromsektor dank der erneuerbaren Energien bei der Dekarbonisierung erhebliche Fortschritte gemacht hat.\nAndere EU-Finanzierungsprogramme wie die Aufbau- und Resilienzfazilität (RRF) und InvestEU tragen ebenfalls dazu bei, das Risiko von Investitionen zu verringern und klimafreundliche Technologieprojekte finanziell zu unterstützen.\nMit all diesen Instrumenten, ihrer vollständigen Umsetzung und der richtigen Unterstützung für Unternehmen und Bürger können wir unsere Ziele für 2030 erreichen. Man könnte sagen, wir können das Spiel um den grünen Übergang gewinnen.\nWir wissen, wie wir es schaffen können. Wir haben uns darauf geeinigt, wie wir es tun wollen.\nSeit 1990 haben wir die Emissionen um über 32 % gesenkt, und das während unser BIP um über 60 % gestiegen ist.\nWir haben die erneuerbaren Energien angekurbelt.\nIn Europa werden immer sauberere Autos verkauft.\nWir investieren in alternative Kraftstoffe.\nWir bauen unsere Kohlenstoffsenken aus.\nWir haben also eine respektable erste Halbzeit hinter uns.\nDer Wettbewerb da draußen ist hart. Sie fragen sich, ob wir so weitermachen können.\nWas machen wir in der zweiten Halbzeit? Wie können wir sicherstellen, dass wir gewinnen? Wie alle guten Taktiker müssen wir die Strategie umsetzen.\nEuropa hat bereits alles, was es braucht, um in der zweiten Halbzeit auf den Platz zu gehen und zu gewinnen.\nJetzt hoffen einige wahrscheinlich, dass ich hier mit den Fußballmetaphern aufhöre, aber lassen Sie mich noch eines sagen: was den Unterschied zwischen einergutenund einergroßartigenMannschaft ausmacht.\nEine großartige Mannschaft weiß aus meiner Sicht, wohin sie will und wie sie dorthin kommt.\nUm Vorhersehbarkeit zu gewährleisten, hat die Kommission vor kurzem empfohlen, die Emissionen in der EU bis 2040 um 90 % zu reduzieren. Dies beruht auf soliden wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen.\nIch möchte betonen, dass die Kommissionsmitteilung zum 2040-Ziel kein Gesetzesvorschlag ist, sondern der Beginn einer Debatte über die Zukunft der Klimapolitik.\nWir wollen mit Bürgern, Unternehmen und anderen Interessengruppen in Kontakt treten, um ihre Ansichten zu hören und in einen möglichen künftigen Vorschlag einfließen zu lassen. Dieser wäre dann Sache der nächsten Kommission.\nHeute Morgen haben Sie auf dieser Tagung die Perspektiven Deutschlands für 2040 aus der Sicht der Industrie diskutiert, wie ich verstanden habe. Ihr Land hat eine beeindruckende Tradition der industriellen Leadership.\nDie Empfehlung für das Klimaziel 2040 setzt ein wichtiges Signal an die Finanzmärkte und an die Industrie, wie man langfristig investieren und effektiv planen kann.\nUnd ich denke, dass die europäischen Wirtschaftsakteure diese Unterstützung zu schätzen wissen und auch die Vorteile des grünen Übergangs erkennen.\nKürzlich haben sich über 100 führende Vertreter von Unternehmen und Investoren aus ganz Europa, die mehr als eine Million Beschäftigte und Billionen von Vermögenswerten vertreten, zusammengeschlossen. Sie unterstützen den Vorschlag der 90 %.\nUnternehmen wie SAP, Unilever, Vattenfall, Otto Group, IKEA, Google und H&M, betonen, dass dieses wissenschaftlich fundierte Ziel die Dringlichkeit und die Vorteile widerspiegelt, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen.\nDiese Unternehmen und Investoren sehen die wirtschaftlichen Chancen und Wettbewerbsvorteile, auch in Bezug auf die Energiesicherheit von Bürgern und Unternehmen.\nGehen wir einen Schritt weiter und betrachten die Welt als Ganzes. Die EU ist für 7 % der weltweiten Treibhausgasemissionen verantwortlich. Die Emissionen der EU sind also nur ein Teil des Puzzles. Andere müssen mitziehen.\nDarum scheuen wir keine diplomatischen Mühen, um unsere internationalen Partner davon zu überzeugen und ihnen Anreize zu bieten, mehr für die Emissionsreduzierung zu tun. Und das zahlt sich aus.\nDie Ergebnisse der COP28 im vergangenen Jahr machen deutlich, dass alle Parteien bereit sind und sein müssen, ihre Maßnahmen zu verstärken.\nAber als weltweit führende Klimaschützer können wir andere Länder natürlich nur dann dazu bringen, mehr zu tun, wenn wir selbst unseren eigenen Verpflichtungen auch nachkommen.\nWir müssen mit gutem Vorbild vorangehen.\nUnd darum, werden wir weiter daran arbeiten, eine Auslagerung von CO2-intensiven Prozessen ins Ausland zu verhindern. Neben dem CO2-Grenzausgleichsmechanismus (CBAM) werden wir die Kohlenstoffmarktdiplomatie beschleunigen.\nEine neue Task Force wird Fachwissen und Mitarbeiter der EU mobilisieren, um andere Länder dabei zu unterstützen, selbst Kohlenstoffmärkte und -preise zu entwickeln.\nDies wird aus meiner Sicht dazu beitragen, CO2-Bepreisung, wie im EU-Emissionshandelssystem, weltweit zu etablieren.\nMeine Damen und Herren,\nWir haben eine gute, respektable erste Halbzeit gespielt.\nWir haben alles, was wir brauchen, um dieses Spiel zu gewinnen.\nLassen Sie mich mit einem letzten Hinweis auf den Fußball schließen. Es gibt einen amüsanten Satz von dem großen englischen Stürmer Gary Lineker, den viele von Ihnen kennen werden.\nEr sagte einmal: “Fußball ist ein einfaches Spiel. Zweiundzwanzig Männer jagen 90 Minuten lang einem Ball hinterher, und am Ende gewinnen immer die Deutschen.”\nIch werde nicht behaupten, dass der grüne Übergang ein einfaches Spiel ist, und es gibt viel mehr als 22 Spieler.\nAber ich glaube fest daran, dass nicht nur Deutschland und Europa, sondern am Ende des Tages auch die ganze Welt gewinnen kann. Vielen Dank für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit!",

        "date": "26 mars 2024",
        "location": "Bruxelles",
        "text": "Mesdames et Messieurs les députés,\nJe suis heureux de participer à la réunion plénière de la COSAC, sous les auspices de la Présidence belge. Parce qu'elle réunit sous son égide les Parlements nationaux – y compris des pays-candidats – et le Parlement européen, qui nous accueille aujourd'hui, la COSAC incarne, je dirais, notre démocratie européenne dans toute sa diversité et sa vitalité. L'occasion pour nous de réaffirmer les valeurs qui nous fédèrent.\n[Introduction : de la nécessité de reprendre notre destin en main]\nCes valeurs, nous les avons forgées des décennies durant. Nous sommes le premier grand continent démocratique de la planète, et les échéances électorales de juin prochain constituent sans nul doute un rendez-vous essentiel.\nAu regard du cours de l'histoire, ces élections sont sans doute les plus importantes depuis longtemps : il s'agit d'envoyer au Parlement européen les femmes et les hommes qui sauront créer des consensus et coalitions pour répondre aux enjeux des années à venir.\nÀ commencer par celui de l'autonomie européenne. Car sans autonomie européenne, il ne peut y avoir de démocratie européenne. Sans autonomie, nous ne pourrons pas faire valoir nos ambitions ; nous ne pourrons pas prospérer ni nous protéger. Mais attention, il ne faut pas confondre autonomie avec isolation ou repli sur soir. Nous parlons d'une Europe plus assertive dans la protection de ses concitoyens, ses entreprises, ses intérêts stratégiques.\nCe nouveau paradigme a fait son chemin au gré des crises que nous avons traversées ces quatre dernières années.\nC'est en 2020, au moment de la pandémie de COVID-19, que nous avons pris véritablement la mesure de nos dépendances, et de certaines conséquences de la mondialisation :  je pense en particulier à la segmentation géographique des chaînes de valeur mondiales ; à l'élongation des chaînes d'approvisionnement ; au totem d'une Europe sans usines, qui hypothèque nos emplois et notre savoir-faire.\nJe le dis clairement : l'Europe est et restera un continent ouvert sur le monde. C'est dans notre ADN.\nNous représentons 16% des exportations mondiales, plus que notre part dans le PIB mondial. Mais dans le même temps nous devons ajuster notre logiciel : pour rester ouverts, certes, mais à nos conditions.\nEt je vois dans la politique industrielle européenne le versant opérationnel de cette autonomie : une politique industrielle volontariste, qui puise au plus profond de nos atouts – ce sera mon premier point ; une politique industrielle qui doit pouvoir s'appuyer sur des conditions règlementaires et financières propices à la compétitivité de l'Europe – ce sera mon deuxième point.\n[1. Capacités industrielles, sécurité économique, défense :une politique industrielle moteur et garante de notre autonomie]\nPour que l'Europe se dote d'une politique industrielle qui soit à la fois moteur et garante de son autonomie, nous devons, il me semble, nous atteler à trois grands chantiers plus que jamais imbriqués : nos capacités de production ; notre sécurité économique ; et, contexte géopolitique oblige, notre industrie de défense.\nD'abord sur nos capacités de production. Nous devons en finir avec le totem d'une Europe sans usine que je viens d'évoquer, car il s'agit ni plus ni moins que d'un anachronisme :  les profondes mutations de l'industrie, en particulier les interactions grandissantes avec l'environnement numérique, rendent la proximité entre les lieux de production, les centres de recherche et les destinataires finaux plus essentielle que jamais.\nÀ l'heure de ce que j'appelle la géopolitique des chaînes de valeur, il n'est plus acceptable que plus des trois quarts du cloud public européen soient encore détenus par les Américains. Il n'est plus acceptable que nous dépendions à 80% de la région indo-pacifique pour nos approvisionnements en semi-conducteurs.\nJe pourrais évoquer également la chaîne de valeur du photovoltaïque, presque entièrement captée par la Chine, dont les surcapacités – trois fois la demande mondiale – ont fait baisser les prix de moitié en un an, menaçant directement la pérennité de notre industrie solaire.\nPour corriger cela, plusieurs jalons importants ont d'ores et déjà été posés. D'abord nous avons renforcé notre arsenal réglementaire pour faire monter en puissance nos capacités manufacturières – je pense au règlement sur les semiconducteurs, le Chips Act – qui à ce jour a permis de mobiliser plus de cent milliards d'euros d'investissements publics et privés, mais aussi aux règlements sur l'industrie zéro nette et les matières premières critiques.\nEn parallèle, nous avons continué d'étoffer notre boîte à outils industrielle. J'ai à l'esprit les alliances industrielles – comme la toute récente alliance pour les petits réacteurs nucléaires modulaires – pour faire aboutir des projets de rupture dans les domaines technologiques les plus critiques, et dont certains peuvent devenir des Projets importants d'intérêt européen commun – les PIIEC.\nJe parlais à l'instant du cloud : à la fin de l'année 2023, plusieurs États-membres ont lancé, avec l'aval de la Commission, un PIIEC sur les infrastructures et services en nuage de nouvelle génération. Plus d'un milliard d'euros vont pouvoir être mobilisés au service de la recherche, le développement et le déploiement industriel, pour contribuer à l'émergence d'un cloud européen souverain.\nConcernant notre souveraineté numérique au sens large, nous sommes là aussi en train de faire bouger les lignes :  j'ai à l'esprit bien sûr la législation sur les services et marchés numériques (DSA-DMA), tout le travail pionnier sur l'intelligence artificielle, sur les données, la cybersécurité et les infrastructures numériques.\nBien évidemment, tout ce travail autour de la consolidation de nos capacités industrielles ne peut pas se faire en vase-clos. Je le disais, nous évoluons dans une géopolitique complexe, où la notion de sécurité économique joue un rôle de plus en plus prépondérant. C'est, je dirais, le deuxième grand chantier auquel nous devons nous atteler.\nNous savons que les dépendances asymétriques dont nous pâtissons peuvent tourner au chantage ou à la coercition par ceux qui ont les cartes en main – je pense au gaz russe ou aux terres rares venues de Chine.\nJe le répète, nous devons rester ouverts sur le monde, mais nous devons le faire intelligemment. Nous devons mieux anticiper et réduire les risques sur les technologies les plus critiques, diversifier nos approvisionnements, notamment en développant nos partenariats stratégiques mais aussi, lorsque cela sera justifié, de prendre des mesures de défense commerciale.\nSur ce dernier point, nous avons déjà obtenu de premiers résultats, avec notre règlement sur les subventions étrangères, dans le domaine du rail, et je l'espère bientôt dans d'autres domaines.\nMais bien entendu, comme je viens de l'évoquer, la sécurité économique c'est aussi la diversification, la coopération avec nos partenaires.\nJe me félicite des progrès que nous avons accomplis en matière de partenariats stratégiques, notamment sur les matières premières, qui nous permettront de diversifier notre approvisionnement, et nous avons par ailleurs conclu des partenariats numériques avec le Japon, la Corée du Sud, Singapour et le Canada. Plus généralement, nous devons aussi travailler avec tous nos partenaires internationaux, notamment dans le cadre de l'initiative « Global Gateway ».\nEnfin, le troisième grand chantier, qui a trait également à la sécurité mais sous un autre angle : l'industrie de défense. Pour obtenir la paix, prépare la guerre, dit-on. En d'autres termes, nous devons monter en puissance sur notre industrie de défense. L'Europe doit prendre en main sa propre sécurité, qui ne peut pas dépendre des résultats d'élections chez nos alliés tous les quatre ans.\nNous avançons, et nous avançons ensemble. Vous le savez, la Commission a présenté récemment une stratégie pour l'industrie de défense. C'est une première. Cette stratégie, via le programme européen industriel de défense, va nous permettre de booster nos capacités, notre réactivité et notre compétitivité. Nous devons donc faire bloc et mutualiser toutes nos forces à l'échelle européenne.\nMais bien sûr, tout cela ne fonctionne que si nous continuons également à promouvoir notre agenda de compétitivité. Ce sera le deuxième et dernier axe de mon intervention.\n[2. Une politique industrielle qui s'appuie sur un cadre d'investissement et de règles robustes, pour assurer le continuum autonomie - compétitivité]\nJ'entends et je lis beaucoup de choses sur le fait que l'UE est en train de se laisser distancer par les États-Unis en termes de compétitivité.\nSelon certains analystes, le PIB de l'UE représentait 90 % du PIB des États-Unis il y a dix ans, et n'en représenterait plus que 60 % aujourd'hui.\nJe n'ai pas entendu ces mêmes analystes dans les années 2000 féliciter l'UE pour ses performances largement supérieures à celles des États-Unis. Et pourtant, si l'on utilise le même indicateur, c'est exactement ce qui s'est passé. Le PIB de l'UE est passé de 70 % du PIB américain en 2000 à 110 % en 2008.\nMais cette analyse est erronée. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'elle est basée sur les taux de change actuels.\nOr, ce n'est pas sorcier, pour comparer la situation économique de deux pays, la meilleure façon est d'utiliser la parité de pouvoir d'achat (PPA).\nQue constatons-nous lorsque nous appliquons cette approche ? Que la différence entre l'UE et les États-Unis n'a pas changé depuis des décennies.\nCe qui est remarquable pour au moins deux raisons :\nAlors bien sûr, tout n'est pas parfait. Le chemin est encore long pour garantir notre compétitivité.\nEt cela passe par mettre à disposition des moyens financiers adéquats. Surmonter nos dépendances, réussir notre double transition verte et numérique, assurer notre sécurité tout en restant compétitifs : tout cela veut dire qu'il va falloir attirer et dé-risquer des investissements colossaux, y compris – ne craignons plus de le dire – en activant le levier des financements publics.\nPour ma part, je milite à Bruxelles pour un véritable changement de paradigme, qui commence par le budget européen. Avec une guerre de haute intensité à nos portes, avec une course mondiale aux technologies vertes et numériques, avec des pratiques commerciales de la part de nos concurrents toujours plus agressives, je pose la question : l'Europe peut-elle se contenter d'un budget qui ne dépasse pas 1% de son PIB ? Vous connaissez ma réponse.\nEnfin, notre marché intérieur. Il est la matrice de notre autonomie et de notre compétitivité. Nous devons continuer de le consolider, de le moderniser, car c'est grâce à son envergure et à sa taille critique que nous pourrons faire de notre politique industrielle un véritable levier de puissance au service de nos ambitions et de notre compétitivité.\nJe pense par exemple au mécanisme carbone d'ajustement aux frontières – le CBAM – que nous avons réussi à mettre en place pour répondre à la problématique des fuites de carbone. Nous devons généraliser cette approche à d'autre domaines, comme par exemple l'économie circulaire.\nDans le même esprit, les achats publics sont un autre levier stratégique : les attributions de marchés publics ne peuvent plus être régentées par le seul critère prix. Il faut également mettre dans la balance des critères plus qualitatifs, comme les critères environnementaux, sociaux ou de résilience européenne. Autrement dit, passer du moins au mieux-disant, car porteur de compétitivité pour l'industrie européenne.\nLe marché intérieur nous donne le poids nécessaire pour faire bouger les lignes, mais je le disais, nous devons le consolider et le moderniser. Le consolider d'abord, en continuant de faire tomber les barrières, avec l'aide des États-membres ; en l'adaptant au nouveau temps des crises majeures, avec notamment le futur règlement sur les situations d'urgence et la résilience du marché intérieur. Le moderniser ensuite, en continuant à développer des outils numériques comme le Single Digital Gateway pour faciliter la vie des citoyens et des entreprises.\nEt puisque nous parlons des entreprises, un dernier mot sur les PME, qui je le rappelle sont le cœur et le moteur de notre marché intérieur. Il faut leur faciliter la vie, leur donner un cadre clair et prévisible. Tout d'abord en s'assurant que notre législation est adaptée et ne crée pas de charge administrative inutile. Il s'agit par exemple d'allonger les périodes de transition pour les PME et de veiller à ce que leurs obligations soient proportionnées.\n*\nVoici, Mesdames et Messieurs, et j'en finirai par là, ce que recouvre, à mon sens, notre agenda de politique industrielle, au service de notre projet européen.\nCar oui, il s'agit bien d'un projet, un projet de paix et de prospérité qu'il faut sans cesse remettre sur le métier. Le travail parlementaire en est l'un des piliers essentiels, et malgré les temps incertains qui s'annoncent, je sais pouvoir compter sur notre envie commune d'avancer ensemble.\nEn cette grande année démocratique pour l'Europe, cette détermination d'avancer ensemble est plus importante que jamais.\nJe vous remercie.",

        "title": "Questions and answers on simplification omnibus I and II",
        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "1. Why are you proposing this omnibus legislation on sustainability rules?\nThe recent Competitiveness Compass sets the vision for strengthening the EU's competitiveness and making the EU's economy more prosperous, building on the recommendations of the Draghi report.\nTo boost our competitiveness and unleash growth, the EU needs to foster a favourable business environment and ensure that companies are not stifled by excessive regulatory burdens. This, in turn, will enable our businesses to grow and create quality jobs, attract investments and get the necessary funds for their transition towards a more sustainable economy and help the EU meet the Green Deal's ambitious objectives. We need to get the balance right. Today, the Commission is also adopting a Clean Industrial Deal, bringing together climate and competitiveness under an overarching growth strategy.\nThat is why the Commission is recalibrating some EU rules in a growth-friendly manner that will enable more cost-effective delivery of our policy objectives. The Commission has a clear target to deliver an unprecedented simplification effort, by achieving at least 25% reduction in administrative burdens and at least 35% for SMEs before the end of the mandate.\nThe Commission's work programme, published on 11 February, announced a first series of “Omnibus” packages. They will address overlapping, unnecessary or disproportionate rules that are creating unnecessary burden for EU businesses.\nToday's proposals  will provide substantial simplification in the field of sustainability and EU investment programmes. The Commission prioritises efforts in this area in line with the Draghi report, the Competitiveness Compass and the findings of the Commission's call for evidence in 2023.\nThe package includes amendments to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), the Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and the InvestEu Regulation. The package is accompanied by a draft Taxonomy Delegated Act for public consultation.  The aim is to square the EU's ambition towards a sustainable transition with enhancing EU companies' competitiveness.\n2. What changes are you proposing today?\nToday's omnibus package includes:\n3. How will companies benefit from this proposal?\nCompanies across the EU – large and small – will benefit from the simplifications of the omnibus proposals. If adopted and implemented as set out today, the proposals are conservatively estimated to bring total savings in annual administrative costs of around EUR 6.3 billion and to mobilise additional public and private investment capacity of EUR 50 billion to support policy priorities.\nToday's omnibus package will protect SMEs from excessive sustainability information requests that they receive when they are included in the value chains of larger companies or from financial institutions, such as banks, which fall in the scope of the CSRD and the CSDDD. All companies with up to 1,000 employees and 50 million turnover will be outside the scope of the CSRD. For the companies in scope (above 1,000 employees and 50 million turnover ), the Commission will adopt a delegated act to revise and simplify the existing sustainability reporting standards (ESRS). The proposed provisions in CSRD also create a derogation for companies with more than 1,000 employees and a turnover below EUR 450 million by making the reporting of Taxonomy voluntary, and also, put a stronger emphasis on transition finance by introducing the option of reporting on partial Taxonomy-alignment.\nWhile boosting EU companies' competitiveness by cutting administrative burden, today's proposal will still allow companies not in the scope of the CSRD to report on sustainability issues if they so wish (voluntary standards for companies not in scope of the CSRD and voluntary EU Taxonomy reporting for companies below a certain threshold).\nSimplified due diligence obligations will benefit both the very large companies (including company groups, license and franchise systems) that fall under the scope of the CSDDD (estimated to be about 6000 EU and 900 non-EU companies) and their value chain partners, including SMEs and small midcap companies (i.e. companies with not more than 500 employees). CSDDD amendments such as the extension of maximum harmonisation, the streamlining of stakeholder engagement, and the clarification – and better alignment with the CSRD – of the obligations regarding adoption of transition plans for climate change mitigation will benefit, in particular, the very large companies that fall under the scope.\nAdditionally, the Commission is also today publishing possible amendments to the Taxonomy Disclosures Delegated Act and the Taxonomy Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts which, among others, simplify the reporting templates, leading to a reduction of data points by almost 70%, introduce a materiality threshold to make disclosure of alignment for companies with less 10% eligible activities not mandatory, introduce the option of reporting partial disclosure to foster transition finance, simplify and make more useful the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) used by banks, reduce the scope for mandatory reporting on operational expenditure and simplify certain ‘Do no significant harm' (DNSH) criteria.\nRegarding CBAM, the main beneficiaries will be the importers of small quantities of CBAM goods, as the proposed new cumulative annual threshold will allow to exempt approximately 90%, 182,000, importers from CBAM obligations, while maintaining the environmental goal of the mechanism by still encompassing more than 99% of the total emissions of the imports across four CBAM sectors (iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers). And for importers that will still be in scope, we simplify the authorisation of declarants, emissions calculations, reporting requirements and the financial liability.\nFinally, amending the InvestEU Regulation, different actors (implementing partners, financial intermediaries, final recipients) in the InvestEU value chain would benefit from reduced reporting and administrative burden. Such simplifications are expected to save around EUR 350 million to those companies while at the same time releasing €50 billion of extra resources in additional public and private investment\n4. How does this proposal help achieve the objectives of the Green Deal?\nWhen presenting the Competitiveness Compass in January, President von der Leyen confirmed clearly that we are staying the course with our Green Deal objectives. In Europe, sustainability and competitiveness should go hand in hand. Companies are supportive of our Green Deal objectives but they request us to be pragmatic and simple. The Commission has listened to concerns of stakeholders, who consider that some sustainability reporting and due diligence rules are too complex and costly to implement, and of limited usefulness for investors and others, hindering the EU's competitiveness and its investment drive. Many companies have highlighted difficulties in applying certain provisions, noting that the accumulation of requirements sometimes leads to unnecessary complexity and costs. Rules designed for larger companies may inadvertently impact SMEs.\nBy making EU companies' lives easier and creating a more favourable business environment, the EU can drive growth and quality jobs, boost investments and, ultimately, enable companies to embrace the transition to a sustainable economy in a more effective and pragmatic way. This  makes our rules fit for purpose, more proportionate and also more appealing.\n5. What are the main changes that the omnibus package is bringing to the CSRD?\nThe omnibus package will bring several changes to the CSRD, making it more proportionate and easier to implement by companies:\n6. What is the scope of the new CSRD?\nCurrently, the CSRD applies to all large companies (defined as companies above two out of the three following thresholds: €50 million net turnover, €25 million balance sheet total, 250 employees), as well as SMEs whose securities are listed on an EU regulated market. However, many businesses and industry associations have suggested that the Commission should revise the scope by excluding the smaller companies. Mario Draghi's report on competitiveness also highlighted that the rules would impose a disproportionately high burden on SMEs and small mid-caps than on larger companies.\nToday's proposal will reduce the current scope of the CSRD to large companies with more than 1000 employees (i.e. companies that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million). Those companies will be required to report against the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), while these standards will also be revised and simplified.\nCompanies outside the scope of CSRD (companies with up to 1,000 employees) may choose to report voluntarily on the basis of a simplified voluntary standard to be adopted by the Commission, based on the voluntary standards for SMEs (VSME) developed by EFRAG.\nThe Commission estimates that the proposal will reduce the number of companies in scope by 80%.\n7. What are the main changes that the omnibus package is bringing to the CSDDD?\n8. How is the omnibus package protecting SMEs and small mid-caps from excessive sustainability information requests?\nSMEs (with the exception of listed SMEs) are currently out of the scope of CSRD. However, in practice, many of them are subject to sustainability information requests when they are included in the value chain of larger companies or from financial institutions, such as banks, which fall within the scope of CSRD.\nToday's proposal will address this “trickle-down” effect by preventing all companies out of scope from being subject to excessive reporting requests. The Commission will adopt a voluntary standard for all companies out of scope, including SMEs, based on the voluntary standard for SMEs (“VSME”) , developed by EFRAG and to be adopted by delegated act.\nThe VSME voluntary standard will be a simple tool helping companies not in scope  to provide sustainability information to large companies subject to CSRD requirements . The VSME voluntary standard will act as a shield or a “value-chain cap” for those out-of-scope companies. Companies in the scope of the CSRD will not be able to request from companies in their value chain that are out of scope, including SMEs and small mid-caps, information that goes beyond the information set out in the VSME voluntary standard.\nAccording to the proposal, the Commission would adopt the voluntary standard as a delegated act. In the meantime, to address market demand, the Commission intends to issue a recommendation on voluntary sustainability reporting as soon as possible, based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG.\nSimilarly, while SMEs and SMCs are not subject to any obligations under the CSDDD, they can be indirectly impacted when large companies need to request information from them to comply with their due diligence obligations.  The proposal will limit the general requests for information for impact mapping that large companies in scope may address to SMEs and SMCs (small midcap companies with up to 500 employees) to information specified in the VSME standard, unless it is necessary for instance because the standard does not cover a relevant impact.\nFurthermore, a number of simplification amendments proposed to the CSDDD will alleviate the burden of smaller business partners in the value chain, including reducing due diligence obligations beyond direct business partners and reducing the frequency of the monitoring of the effectiveness of due diligence measures, moving from a yearly assessment to an assessment every 5 years. Those measures will significantly relieve burden for SMEs and SMCs in the value chain of larger companies subject to CSDDD.\n9. What are the expected benefits of the proposed modifications to CSRD on companies?\nThe proposed measures reducing the scope of the CSRD and the reporting requirements for companies remaining in scope, including future changes to the ESRS, will generate significant cost savings for companies and should boost the EU's competitiveness.\nThe total annual cost savings of the changes in the CSRD scope and future modifications to the ESRS could be about €4.4 billion. This includes annual cost savings resulting from the reduced scope of  Taxonomy reporting, as a result of the reduced CSRD scope, of €0.8 billion. On top of those recurrent savings, there would be the one-off cost savings in relation to setting up the reporting and assurance processes that would be avoided for exempted firms, which amount to about €1.6 billion in relation to CSRD/ESRS and €0.9 billion for the Taxonomy.\n10. What are the expected benefits of the proposed modifications to the CSDDD for companies?\nIn general, companies will be subject to a sustainability due diligence framework that is less complex and more harmonised, ensuring burden reduction and a level playing field. The most important costs savings are expected to arise as a result of the simplification  of the due diligence obligations with respect to harmful impacts arising at the level of indirect business partners and the less frequent (5-yearly) regular monitoring exercises. In addition, smaller companies in scope will be protected from unnecessary information requests from their large business partners. These savings have been conservatively estimated at €320 million per annum, as well as substantial one-off cost savings.\n11. Is the Commission changing the principle of double materiality of the CSRD?\nNo. The omnibus proposal does not change the ‘double materiality perspective', meaning that companies remaining in scope will have to report about how sustainability risks affect their business and about their own impact on people and the environment.\n12. What are the main changes to the Taxonomy ?\nThe Omnibus package includes, on the one hand,amendments to the CSRD regarding Taxonomy reporting as a derogation to Article 8 Taxonomy Regulationand, on the other hand, theCommission proposes draft amendments to the Taxonomy Disclosures, Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts.\nFor companies within the future CSRD scope (large companies that have more than 1,000 employees) with a net turnover up to 450 million, the Omnibus proposal envisages voluntary Taxonomy reporting. This will reduce the number of companies that are obliged to report their Taxonomy alignment.\nMoreover, companies that have made progress towards sustainability targets, but only meet certain EU Taxonomy requirements, may choose to voluntarily report on their partial Taxonomy-alignment. This enables them to demonstrate their existing efforts and progress towards full alignment and receive recognition for their commitment to sustainability. The Omnibus proposal also mandates the Commission to develop delegated acts to ensure standardisation in terms of the content and presentation of the respective reporting.\nThe Commission is also publishing for consultation draft amendments to the Taxonomy Disclosures Delegated Act and the Taxonomy Climate and environmental Delegated Acts which:\nFurthermore, we propose amendments to the main key performance indicators of financial institutions, especially the green asset ratio (GAR) for banks. Based on the published text banks will be able to exclude from the denominator of the GAR, exposures that relate to undertakings which are not under the future scope of the CSRD (i.e. companies that are not large undertakings with 1,000 or more employees).\nThe Commission is also asking for feedback on two alternative options for simplifying the most complex “Do no Significant harm” criteria for pollution prevention and control related to the use and presence of chemicals that apply horizontally to all economic sectors under the EU Taxonomy. In the public consultation, stakeholders are invited to provide feedback to both alternative options.\n14. What is the aim of these proposed simplification amendments?The proposed amendments aim to simplify and strengthen the CBAM mechanism. They aim to spare 90% of concerned companies from reporting requirements, while still covering 99% of the C02 emissions. The proposed simplifications reflect the insights gathered in the transitional period, in place since October 2023. Overall, simplification is key to reducing administrative burden for SMEs and occasional importers. This learning period, during the CBAM transitional phase, has allowed us to develop the policy measures jointly with stakeholders. Simplification is also a precondition to review CBAM and make it stronger and more efficient. Going forward, the next steps will include a full review of CBAM later this year, to assess its potential extension to other ETS sectors, downstream goods, indirect emissions. The Commission will also examine, in this context, how to help exporters of CBAM products at risk of carbon leakage. This will be followed by a legislative proposal in early 2026.\n15. What is the formula for determining this new annual mass-threshold?\nThe formula is set up to determine the level of mass-threshold that would exempt as many importers as possible, while making sure that we capture at least 99% of emissions.To do this, we estimate all emissions of imports that would stay in scope for a given mass-threshold and divide this by all emissions of all importers of CBAM goods.\nStep 1:We count all emissions of all importers of CBAM goods.\nStep 2:We find out how many importers need to stay in scope to capture at least 99% of emissions. An algorithm counts, for each possible mass threshold, only those emissions from importers that import more than the mass-based threshold.  Example: For a mass-threshold of 40t, all emissions of all importers with annual mass of more than 40t of CBAM goods are counted. The algorithm does the same for every possible number within a credible range and then divides for each possible mass-based threshold the emissions above the threshold by total emissions in scope if no de minimis were to apply. This gives us a number of around 51.3t.\nStep 3:For simplicity and clarity in communication, and also to avoid having to update the threshold in the future at the margin, we round the threshold to the nearest ten, i.e. in this case to 50t. The goal is to set an annual based threshold so that at least 99% of all emissions from these imported goods are tracked. This system ensures that the vast majority of emissions are accounted for, without tracking every small importer. If trade patterns or emission intensities change significantly over time, the threshold will be adjusted to maintain the 99% emissions coverage.\n16. What specific regulations will be simplified, and how will this reduce administrative burdens for businesses and citizens and improve competitiveness?\nThe InvestEU and EFSI Regulations will be simplified with a view to reducing the frequency and the content of some reports e.g. exempting small final recipients such as SMEs, as well as the application of certain rules (e.g. the adjusted application of the SME definition for certain financial products), in line with the principle of proportionality. In this way, it aims at reducing the administrative burden for the InvestEU implementing partners and also for financial intermediaries and final recipients, notably the SMEs, which need to provide information for reports to the Commission and also to apply the established rules.\nThe simplification will also cover non-legislative requirements applying to InvestEU, EFSI and to legacy instruments (like InnovFin,CEF …), in particular regarding the reduction of frequency and content of certain reports.\nSuch simplifications are expected to save around EUR 350 million for implementing partners, financial intermediaries, final recipients of InvestEu funds.\n17. What measures are being proposed to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) benefit from these simplification efforts?\nMany of the proposed measures will benefit SMEs directly and, in some cases, exclusively. This is in particular the case for a simplified application of the SME definition and for the waiver of KPIs for small transactions. Furthermore, the reduction of frequency and content of some reports will also benefit SMEs, to the extent they will not be required to provide inputs for these reports to the implementing partners.\n18. How exactly the proposed measures will unlock the investment capacity of around EUR 50 billion?\nThe proposal to amend the InvestEU Regulation would help mobilise additional EUR 50 billion of investment by:\n1) increasing the size of the EU guarantee by EUR 2.5 billion, and\n2) facilitating the combined use of the InvestEU guarantee with existing capacity available under three legacy programmes (EFSI, CEF Debt Instrument and InnovFin Debt Facility) to support new InvestEU financing and investment operations.\nBy streamlining the programs' operations, the Commission expects to unlock around €50 billion in public and private investment, driving growth and innovation in key sectors such as clean tech, digitalization, and sustainable infrastructure.",

        "title": "Remarks by Commissioner Hoekstra at the event ‘The EU's Carbon-Border Adjustment Mechanism for Climate Policy, and Implications for Chinese Companies', hosted by the EU-China Partnership Facility (ECPF)",
        "date": "Nov 16, 2023",
        "location": "Beijing",
        "text": "It is a pleasure and honour for me to open this forum bringing together so many distinguished guests.\nThis event bears testimony to our mutual interest to better understand the EU and China's respective climate policies and each other's motivations and concerns.\nI am here today with Director-General Gerassimos Thomas of the European Commission as well as the experts who designed and will implement the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nYour event is very timely. If you are exporting iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizer, electricity or hydrogen to the EU, you will have to report these products' CO2 emissions from 1 January 2024 onwards.\nToday, I would like to explain why the EU has decided to take this measure.\nThe Director General will then walk you through the Mechanism, best known by its acronym: “CBAM”.\nLet me first recall the beginnings of CBAM.\nOur generation is facing multiple crises that jeopardise life on earth: pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change.\nThese crises are heavily interlinked, nobody can escape their devastating impacts, and we can only solve them together.\nOr, to put it differently: in the face of these crises, we are all compatriots.\nThat is why, back in 2015, the entire world signed up to the Paris Agreement.\nAs you may know, the goal of the Paris Agreement is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels”, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nThe reality is the more we wait to take decisive action against climate change, the more expensive it will become for all of us.\nLast year, your country experienced the heaviest rainfall in six years, followed by several months of historically high temperatures.\nRainfall in the Yangtze area was only 40% of what is considered normal, and water flow was 50% below normal in August and September. It impacted agriculture, energy production, and more.\nIn Europe, at the same time, we experienced the hottest summer in years, after historic droughts created problems in many places of our part of the world.\nWe are observing these impacts not only in China and in the European Union, but literally facing them all across the world.\nWhat we experience already corroborates the findings of the International Panel for Climate Change.\nThey are the world's most authoritative climate scientists and they include Chinese, European as well as many other experts.\nThe IPCC represents global scientific consensus and their Sixth Assessment Report was discussed with representatives of governments prior to publication.\nWhat do they tell us? It's quite clear: by 2030, global emissions will need to be cut by almost half if we do want to keep a shot at the 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nIf we do not meet these targets, the adverse impacts of climate change will increase significantly, including through the type of extreme weather events I just described.\nIn the Paris Agreement, we all agreed thatevery country needs to do what it can, reflecting its highest possible ambition.\nThe world's eyes are specifically on the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.\nThe world is looking at us, the EU, China, the United States, to lead.\nIf major emitters like us do not significantly cut emissions, global efforts will simply fail.\nAnd yes, this is all on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities, but I do want to underline that every country, eery single country, carries the responsibility to set the highest possible ambition.\nParticularly for those with a leading position, with significant economic power, and with the size and the weight in the international area, they have to rise to this occasion.\nIn the European Union, we see to rise to this occasion.\nOurGreen Deal ensures the EU cuts emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and become climate neutral in 2050,and that is in line with the Paris Agreement.\nThese are for the Union at large and for every individual countrylegally binding targets, since we adopted the European Climate Law in 2021.\nWe have set out a wide-ranging legislative agenda to meet these targets and are implementing in a way that ensures for our companies and our people a just transition.\nI think it is fair to say that the results are there: the EU's per capita emissions are already far below those in China and, by 2030, we expect they will be significantly below the global average.\nBoth our policies and the political commitment have made it through the severe strains that we have experienced following the horrible and illegal Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIn fact, in response to the widespread energy disruption that followed the invasion, we sped up our transition.\nWe rapidly increased energy savings and accelerated the deployment of renewables.\nWhile in the immediate response, existing spare coal capacities were used more, we did not build a single new coal power plant.\nInstead, we fast-tracked the clean-energy transition, some say by 5 years, and proved that energy security and climate ambition can actually go hand in hand.\nWith this recent experience in mind, we are working to gather a large number of countries to endorse aglobal energy pledge.\nWe do so together with the Presidency of the COP28, the upcoming global climate negotiations in Dubai.\nSignatories to the pledge commit to a collective aim totriple renewable capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030.\nWe expect all G7 countries (and the vast majority of the G20 countries) to endorse this pledge.\nIn the past years, China has already demonstrated a remarkable progress in expanding renewables.\nAnd China's participation to this pledge would be an extremely important positive signal.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe energy transition that I am speaking of also requires that we phase out fossil fuels and bring down overall emissions.\nIn the EU, the Emissions Trading System is helping us achieve both these objectives.\nThe EU ETS, as we call it, puts a ceiling on total emissions from industry and from energy.\nThis is an absolute number of tons of CO2.\nEach year, the total amount of emissions is reduced – this will be [a reduction of] 4.3% each year.\nEmitting CO2 under this ceiling requires certificates, which are either allocated for free or are being bought.\nAll certificates can be traded all over the EU.\nThis creates a market dynamic that puts a premium on clean production and incentives businesses to move out of fossil fuels.\nThis makes our system the most economical way into the green transition.\nTo date, the EU ETS has helped bring down emissions from energy and industry by roughly 40%.\nAnd the sale of certificates raised over EUR 150 billion for national governments so far.\nIt is far to say that ETS is a cost-efficient and very much effective instrument.\nThis is why we will soon be extending the system and its price signal to maritime transport and to domestic aviation.\nWe are also putting in place a separate ETS for road transport and for buildings.\nHaving said that, let me now move to CBAM, or the Carbon-Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nAs the EU's experience with emissions trading has shown, robust carbon pricingworksto drive emission reductions.\nBut I cannot stress enough that this puts our industry under severe strain, not only domestically, but frankly speaking particularly internationally.\nFollowing the Green Deal, the emissions cap for EU industries will be rapidly reduced, and they must find ways to change unsustainable production practices.\nSuch stringent carbon policies could result in companies moving outside the EU, thus exporting their emissions to other countries.\nIt is the phenomenon we call “carbon leakage”.\nNobody would be helped by that.\nClimate change is a global crisis, and to tackle it, emissions have to go down all across the world, not just move from one place to the next.\nExporting emissions would reverse progress made in the EU.\nAnd that is at the heart of the logic of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nCBAM is a climate policy tool to prevent that carbon emissions, and pollution more generally, are simply exported from the EU to elsewhere.\nIt does so by ensuring that domestic and international companies pay the same CO2 price when selling on the EU market.\nThrough CBAM, certain energy-intensive products – iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizer, electricity and hydrogen – will be subject to broadly the same standards regarding carbon used in their production, regardless of origin.\nIn the EU, through the ETS. And from outside the EU, through CBAM.\nThe Mechanism will be phased in slowly, preciselyto avoid any carbon leakage.\nLet me also note that EU companies subject to the ETS will not be compensated when they export to third-country markets.\nThe Director-General will explain how CBAM works and why it is fully, totally, 100% compliant with WTO rules.\nYou will see that CBAM, regardless of what people try to push for, is not a “penalty” for importers to the EU, but an incentive for decarbonisation.\nNow that CBAM has entered in to force, any export-focused Chinese company here today ought to take mitigation action and get ready to report on the carbon content of their products.\nAnd make no mistake, every country that is going through a green transition will have to deal with the problem of carbon leakage sooner or later.\nWe should continue to ensure, however that together, we avoid exporting CO2 and instead take the measures to promote decarbonisation at home as well as abroad.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nEuropean citizens and I presume citizens all over the world do not want to choose between economic growth, well-being and fighting climate change.\nThey know that these can and should be combined.\nBut as Climate Commissioner, I do get asked: what difference does the Green Deal make, if you take into account that the EU is only responsible of 7% of global greenhouse gases and not for the other 93%?\nI tell them that we altogether have to do our homework, but also we have to build partnerships across the globe, and work together.\nSo today, I am addressing you: we do need China, currently the source of 28% of global emissions, to lead the global green transition together with all of us.\nAnd I am convinced that exchange and dialogue, including on CBAM, will help the EU and China cooperate on further greening our bilateral economic relationship.\nI would like to encourage all of you to take full advantage of today's gathering to engage with our experts, discuss how to prepare for CBAM and exchange experiences about decarbonisation.\nThe EU is very much looking forward to working together with China, with its companies, with its businesses to accelerate the green transition in the EU, but also here in China and all over the world.",

        "text": "The European Commission welcomes the provisional agreement reached with the European Parliament and Council tostrengthen the EU Emissions Trading System(ETS),apply emissions trading to new sectorsfor effective economy-wide climate action, andestablish aSocial Climate Fund. This deal is a fundamental step towards reaching the EU's commitment to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. At the same time the Social Climate Fund will help to ensure that the transition is fair.\nAgainst the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this agreement shows once again the EU's determination to become climate neutral by 2050, transform our economy and society, leave nobody behind, and ensure our energy security. To complement the substantial spending on climate in the EU budget, Member States willspend the entirety of their emissions trading revenues on climate and energy-related projects and to address social aspects of the transition.\nStrengthening and expanding EU emissions trading\nThe EU ETS puts a price on CO2and lowers the permitted level of emissions every year in sectors including power and heat generation, energy-intensive industrial sectors and commercial aviation. Today's agreement willreduce emissionsfrom the EU ETS sectors by62% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. This representsa substantial increase of 19 percentage pointscompared to the 43% reduction under the existing legislation. Thespeed of annual emission reductions will also increase, from 2.2% per year under the current system to 4.3% from 2024 to 2027 and 4.4% from 2028. The Market Stability Reserve, which stabilises the carbon market by removing surplus allowances, will be strengthened. The agreement willgradually phase out free emission allowances to certain enterprisesand phase in theCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism(CBAM) between 2026 and 2034 for the sectors covered. This follows theprovisional dealreached on CBAM by European co-legislators on 13 December.\nThe deal alsoincludesshipping emissions in the EU ETS, making the EU the first jurisdiction to put an explicit carbon price on emissions from the maritime sector. To support Member States in their effortsto reduce emissions from buildings and road transport, and certain industrial sectors anew separate emissions trading systemwill start from 2027 for relevant fuel use. While so far emission reductions in those sectors have been insufficient to put the EU on a firm path towards its goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050, the new system will ensure cost-effective reductions and generate revenue that will be available to Member States and for support under the Social Climate Fund. This upstream system will regulate fuel suppliers rather than households and drivers. Safeguards are put in place to allow the release of extra allowances on the market if prices exceed certain thresholds, and to avoid double pricing when existing national measures are in place.\nToday's compromise alsoincreases the size of the Innovation and Modernisation Funds. The Modernisation Fund will support three additional Member States with their transition. The Innovation Fund will be expanded, and will also be able to support the maritime sector's decarbonisation efforts.\nCreating a Social Climate Fund\nThe new Social Climate Fund will providededicated financial supportto Member Statesto help vulnerable citizens and micro-enterpriseswith investments in energy efficiency measures such as home insulation, heat pumps, solar panels, and electric mobility. It will also be able to provide direct income support covering up to 37.5% of the new national Social Climate Plans. It will start operating in 2026, before the entry into force of the new ETS for transport and building fuels, and will befinanced by €65 billion from the EU budget, plus 25% co-financing by Member States.\nNext steps\nToday's provisional agreement now requires formal adoption by the Parliament and the Council. Once this process is completed, the new legislation will be published in the Official Journal of the Union and enter into force.\nBackground\nSince the EU ETS was introduced in 2005,emissions have been cut by 34.6%in the main sectors covered: power and heat generation and energy-intensive industrial installations. In 2021, installations covered by the EU ETS accounted for around 40% of the EU's total emissions. The strengthened rules will be crucial for the EU to reach its climate objectives under the Paris Agreement and make the European Green Deal a reality.\nThe European Green Deal is the EU's long-term growth strategy to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050. To reach this target Europe must reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This agreement on the revision of the Emissions Trading System and the creation of the Social Climate Fund is a fundamental step in the adoption of the Commission's‘Fit for 55' legislative packageto deliver theEuropean Green Deal. It follows recent deals on theEmissions Trading System for aviation, onCO2 emissions standards for cars and vans, on theEffort Sharing Regulation, onLand, Land Use and Land Use Changeand the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nAt the end of the negotiations, Executive Vice-President FransTimmermanspaid tribute to Mauro Petriccione, the former Director-General for Climate Action who led the Commission's work on these proposals until he sadly passed away this Summer.\nQuotes by Members of the College\nExecutive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, FransTimmermans,said:“Emissions trading is the centrepiece of our European Green Deal – putting a price on carbon. A stronger Emissions Trading System will help us drive investment into decarbonisation and reduce emissions further and faster, in line with our climate targets. With the new Social Climate Fund, the EU will ensure that our green transition is done in a way that protects our most vulnerable and helps them be part of the transition. At the end of a challenging year, this is much-needed positive news; in the face of strong headwinds, we continue delivering on the European Green Deal for a sustainable future.”\nFor More Information\nFit for 55 Proposals\nProposal to revise the EU Emissions Trading System\nProposal for a Regulation establishing a Social Climate Fund\nEU Emissions Trading System webpage\n* updated on 24/01/2023 – 11.00",

        "text": "COP15: historic global deal for nature and people\nEarly this morning at the UN Biodiversity conference COP15 in Montréal, Canada, the EU joined 195 countries in the historicKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. This framework contains global goals and targets aiming to protect and restore nature for current and future generations, ensure its sustainable use as well as spur investments for a green global economy. Together with the Paris Agreement on climate, it paves the way towards a climate-neutral, nature-positive and resilient world by 2050.\nThe agreement is asolid framework withclear, measurable goals and targets, withcomplete monitoring, reporting, and review arrangements to track progress complemented by a robust resource mobilisation package.\nMore thanhalf of global GDP depends on ecosystem services. 70% of the world's most vulnerable people depend directly on wild species. The Kunming-Montreal agreement will accelerate ambitious policies around the world andmobilise financing for biodiversity from all sources – USD 200 billion per year by 2030. It commits the global community to actions to protect and restore nature and remove pollution – such as those that are part of the European Green Deal. This will ensure that nature continues sustaining societies, economies and communities for decades to come.\nFor more information seeStatement by President von der Leyenandpress release.\n(For more information: Tim McPhie – Tel.: +32 2 295 86 02; Daniela Stoycheva – Tel.: +32 229 53664)\nEuropean Green Deal: EU agrees to strengthen and expand emissions trading, and creates a Social Climate Fund to help people in the transition\nThe European Commission welcomes the provisional agreement reached with the European Parliament and Council in the early hours of Sunday tostrengthen theEU Emissions Trading System (ETS),apply emissions trading to new sectorsfor effective economy-wide climate action, andestablish aSocial Climate Fund.

The screening showed that more than half of the products monitored presented a price reduction announcement for Black Friday, and out of this number, 23% were clearly inconsistent with EU law. ThePrice Indication Directiveprovides that shops, including online marketplaces, must indicate the lowest price applied to the product in the preceding 30 days when announcing a discount. The sweep showed violations in at least 43% of the screened websites. National authorities monitored the prices of 16,000 products from 176 websites over a period of one month.\nIt is now up to the authorities to contact the traders concerned to request changes in their practices and, if necessary, initiate enforcement actions, which could ultimately lead to fines, if the practices are not corrected. The European Commission provided the AI-based tool to automatically detect misleading discounts in the context of the EU eLab, a project aimed at developing and applying advanced digital technologies to online consumer investigations in support of theConsumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) network.\nCommissioner for Justice, DidierReynders,said:“Today's results show that consumers continue to be exposed to a large number of untruthful discounts and unfair commercial practices. This is a breach of EU law. We call on all online retailers to fully respect the rules, and revise their discounts presentation. Good deals must be a real advantage and not a manipulative marketing technique; they should always be based on a concrete price difference”.\nMore information on this and previous Consumer Protection Network sweeps can be foundhere.\n(For more information: Christian Wigand - Tel.: +32 2 296 22 53; Katarzyna Kolanko - Tel.: +32 2 296 34 44)\nFirst half of 2023:Commission to issue up to €80 billion of EU-bonds to finance pandemic recoveryandsupport for Ukraine\nThe European Commission has today announced that it intends to issue up to €80 billion of long-term EU-Bonds in the first half of 2023 under its unified funding approach. Under this approach, the Commission – on behalf of the EU - will henceforth issue only ‘EU-Bonds' rather than separately denominated bonds for individual programmes such as SURE and Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA).\nThe programmes to be financed through the unified funding approach in the first half of next year are the NextGenerationEU recovery programme and the new Macro-Financial Assistance + programme for Ukraine. The former will account for some €70 billion and the latter for around €10 billion.\nThe unified funding approach will allow the instruments developed for NextGenerationEU to be used in the same way for other lending programmes. All of these programmes can be funded in a flexible manner, relying on the proceeds of a single scheme of EU-Bills and EU-Bonds transactions.\nThe NextGenerationEU green programme will continue to be financed through clearly and separately designated NextGenerationEU green bond issuances. In this way, investors will remain able to verify that proceeds from the NGEU green bonds are over time matched to eligible green bond expenditures in accordance with the NextGenerationEU green bond framework.\nThe European Commission currently runs two major programmes financed through capital markets funding – the NextGenerationEU recovery instrument of around €800 billion between mid-2021 and end-2026 and the Macro-Financial Assistance + programme, to provide €18 billion of support to Ukraine in 2023.\nMore information are available in thepress releaseand in theQ&A.

In particular, it implements Article 321 of theEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which provides that the EU and the UK are to create a specific forum for technical discussions on offshore renewable energy development, building on NSEC.\nWelcoming the signature of the agreement, Commissioner for Energy KadriSimsonsaid:“The Memorandum signed today provides the NSEC members and the UK with a basis to cooperate on offshore energy. Given the significant potential of offshore renewable energy in the North Seas, this cooperation is crucial to help achieve our joint renewable offshore ambitions. The exchanges will build on the successful work of NSEC.”\nYou will find more informationhere.\n(For more information: Tim McPhie – Tel.: +32 229 58602; Giulia Bedini – Tel: +32 229 58661)\nCommission sets up rules to identifyendocrine disruptors and long-lasting chemicals and to improvelabelling\nToday, the Commission proposed a revised Regulation on classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals (CLP) and introduced new hazard classes for endocrine disruptors and other harmful chemical substances to better protect people and the environment from hazardous chemicals.\nThe revised Regulation clarifies rules on labelling and for chemicals sold online. This will hence facilitate business, including for SMEs, and the free movement of substances and mixtures at EU level.\nThe Commission adopted a Delegated Act to introduce new hazard classesfor endocrine disruptors, as well as for chemicals that do not break down in the environment and can accumulate in living organisms, or risk entering and spreading across the water cycle, including drinking water.\nThe new hazard classes are the result of extensive scientific discussions and will provide clarity to all users of such chemicals. They could allow further action to address and mitigate the risks of substances and mixtures under other EU downstream legislation such as e.g. REACH, while taking account of socio-economic impacts.

This will ensure the continuity of supplies of veterinary medicinal products, in particular to Northern Ireland.\nThe Commission recognises the key importance of veterinary medicines for food safety, animal health and welfare, and public health. It has been listening carefully to the concerns expressed by relevant authorities and stakeholders – particularly those from Northern Ireland – in the area of veterinary medicines. The Commission has therefore acted today to provide additional time to businesses to adapt their supply chains.\nThe UK's decision to leave the EU means that EU pharmaceutical rules no longer apply in the UK. Under the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, these rules apply in Northern Ireland. This has created difficulties for many EU or Northern Ireland established operators which relied on the supply of veterinary medicinal products from or through parts of the UK, other than Northern Ireland.\nTo ensure the continuity of supply of veterinary medicinal products and allow operators sufficient time to adapt their supply chains, the Commission adopted on 25 January 2021 a notice providing for flexibility in the application of EU rules until 31 December 2021. At the end of 2021, it was clear that the situation remained challenging for market operators. Therefore, on 29 December 2021, a further extension was granted until 31 December 2022.\nFor more information a press release is availablehere.\n(For more information:  Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024; Francesca Dalboni – Tel: +32 229 88170)\nInvestEU: Agreement between EIF and Orion Leasing offers €52.8 million in fresh funding for Lithuanian companies\nThe European Investment Fund (EIF) and UAB Orion Leasing, backed by theInvestEU programme, have signed a guarantee agreement for€52.8 millionin new financing in the form of leasing contracts and micro loans.

Les deux premières enquêtes ont été conclues en 2021 et 2022 et les résultats peuvent également être consultésen ligne. La chaîne d'approvisionnement alimentaire est vulnérable aux pratiques commerciales déloyales en raison des déséquilibres flagrants entre les petits et les grands opérateurs. Les agriculteurs et les petits opérateurs de la chaîne d'approvisionnement alimentaire n'ont souvent pas un pouvoir de négociation suffisant pour se défendre contre eux. Pour mieux les protéger, la directive sur les pratiques commerciales déloyales interdit 16 pratiques commerciales déloyales.

Le climat est un facteur très important de la typicité des vins «Rosalia». La chaleur diurne permet aux raisins de bien mûrir et donc de développer le goût de cerise acide et de prune typique des cépages. En revanche, les nuits fraîches provoquent principalement la formation d'arômes primaires, ce qui confère aux vins un fruité typique et des tanins modérés.\nLes vins « Rivierenland » proviennent de la région contiguë qui sépare et longe les cours d'eaux s'écoulant de l'Allemagne et de la province du Limbourg à travers la province de Gueldre jusqu'à Gorinchem. La zone est principalement délimitée par les rivières qui la traversent. Tous les aspects du terroir – le climat, la situation, le sol, la conduite du vignoble, le choix des cépages et la méthode de vinification – contribuent à la qualité des vins, et leur confèrent des arômes fruités.\nCes nouvelles dénominations seront ajoutées à la liste des 1627 vins déjà protégés.

Cet investissement contribue à la réalisation des objectifs de l'UE, notamment : éliminer progressivement les voitures émettrices de CO2 des transports urbains, encourager un transfert vers des modes de transport plus durables afin de réduire les encombrements et la pollution dans les villes, et mettre en œuvre la législation européenne sur la qualité de l'air. Le projet devrait permettre de réduire les émissions de CO2 de 9 kt par an en moyenne, au cours de la période d'évaluation du projet, grâce au remplacement des voitures conventionnelles fonctionnant aux combustibles fossiles par des véhicules électriques sans émission de gaz d'échappement.\nLa commissaire chargée des transports, AdinaVălean, a déclaré :« Avec ce prêt, nous soutenons Cabify dans le déploiement de 1 400 véhicules électriques et de l'infrastructure de recharge qui les accompagne. Chaque initiative tournée vers l'avenir comme celle-ci compte, alors que nous nous efforçons de franchir l'étape de notre Stratégie pour une mobilité durable et intelligente, qui consiste à avoir au moins 30 millions de voitures à émissions nulles sur nos routes d'ici 2030. Cette date approchant rapidement, nous restons très engagés dans l'accélération de la transition vers la mobilité durable. »\nUn communiqué de presse de la BEI est disponibleen ligne.\n(Pour plus d'informations : Stefan De Keersmaecker – Tél. : +32 2 298 46 80 ; Célia Dejond – Tél. : +32 2 298 81 99)\nAntitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Meta over abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace\nThe European Commission has informedMetaof its preliminary view that the company breached EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in the markets for online classified ads. The Commission preliminary finds that Meta isdominantin themarket for personal social networks, which is across Europe, as well as thenational markets for online display advertising on social media.\nThe Commission takes issue with Meta tying its online classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, to its personal social network, Facebook. The Commission is also concerned that Meta is imposing unfair trading conditions on Facebook Marketplace's competitors for its own benefit.\nIf confirmed, these practices would infringe Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU') that prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position.\nExecutive Vice-President MargretheVestager, in charge of competition policy, said:“With its Facebook social network, Meta reaches globally billions of monthly users and millions active advertisers. Our preliminary concern is that Meta ties its dominant social network Facebook to its online classified ad services called Facebook Marketplace. This means Facebook users have no choice but to have access to Facebook Marketplace. Furthermore, we are concerned that Meta imposed unfair trading conditions, allowing it to use of data on competing online classified ad services. If confirmed, Meta's practices would be illegal under our competition rules.”\nA press release is availableonline.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024;Maria Tsoni – Tel.: +32 229 90526)\nAntitrust: Commission closes investigation into Google and Meta agreement for online display advertising\nThe European Commission has decided to close its antitrust investigation into an allegedly anticompetitive agreement betweenGoogleandMetafor online display advertising services (the so-called “Jedi Blue” agreement).\nOn11 March 2022, the Commission opened an investigation to assess whether Google and Meta agreed to weaken and exclude a competing technology to Google's Open Bidding from the market for displaying ads on publisher websites and apps, in breach of EU antitrust rules.\nFollowing a careful assessment of all relevant evidence, including information received from Google, Meta and other companies active in the tech sector, the Commission concluded that the evidence did not confirm its initial concerns and has therefore decided to close its investigation.\nThe Commission will continue to monitor business practices in the European tech sector. A separateinvestigationinto Google's possible abuse of dominance in the ad tech sector is still ongoing.\nMore information on the investigation will be available on the Commission's competitionwebsite, in the public caseregisterunder the case numberAT. 40774.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta–Tel.: +32 229 87024; Maria Tsoni – Tel.: +32 229 90526)\nState aid: Commission approves €1 billion Dutch scheme to support small energy users in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine\nThe European Commission has approved a€1 billionDutch scheme to support small energy users in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine. The scheme was approved under the State aidTemporary Crisis Framework.\nThe measure will be open to all small energy users active in the Netherlands, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs'). The purpose of the scheme is to offset a part of the monthly energy bills for electricity, gas and heat of the eligible beneficiaries. Under this measure, the aid will consist oflimited amounts of aidin the form of direct grants channelled via the energy suppliers.\nThe Commission concluded that the Dutch scheme is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the aid measure under EU State aid rules.\nExecutive Vice-PresidentMargrethe Vestagerin charge of competition policy, said:\"This €1 billion Dutch measure will help reducing the energy bills of small energy users. It is a good example of how EU State aid rules can help Member States support smaller companies with limited impact on competition and on the European energy markets.\"\nA press release is availableonline.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024; Nina Ferreira - Tel.: +32 229 98163; Maria Tsoni – Tel.: +32 229 90526)\nState aid: Commission approves €2.1 billion Flemish scheme to compensate energy-intensive companies for indirect emission costs\nThe European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a€2.1 billionFlemish scheme to partially compensate energy-intensive companies for higher electricity prices resulting from the impact of carbon prices on electricity generation costs (so-called ‘indirect emission costs'), incurred between 2021 and 2030, under theEU Emission Trading System (‘ETS').\nThe measure will benefit companies active in sectors at risk of carbon leakage listed in Annex I to theETS State aid Guidelines. Those sectors face significant electricity costs and are particularly exposed to international competition. The compensation will be granted to eligible companies through apartial refund of the indirect emission costsincurred in the previous year, with the final payment to be made in 2031. Due to the extraordinary circumstances related to the current energy crisis, the deadline for the payments of 2021 will be 31 May 2023.\nThe maximum aid amount per beneficiary will be equal to 75 % of the indirect emission costs incurred. Subject to the approval of the Flemish government, the maximum aid amount could be higher to limit the remaining indirect emission costs incurred to 1.5 % of the company's gross value added. To encourage energy savings, the aid amount is calculated based on electricity consumption efficiency benchmarks. In order to qualify for compensation, beneficiaries have to implement certain energy audit recommendations. In addition, they have to submit a climate plan to become carbon neutral by 2050 and invest at least 50 % of the aid amount in projects to reduce their carbon footprint.\nThe Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, and in particular theETS State aid Guidelines. The Commission found that the scheme is necessary and appropriate to support energy-intensive companies to cope with the higher electricity prices and to avoid that companies relocate to countries outside the EU with less ambitious climate policies, resulting in an increase in global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the Commission found that the scheme complies with the requirements set out in the ETS State aid Guidelines. It therefore supports the EU's climate and environmental objectives and the goals set in theEuropean Green Deal. On this basis, the Commission approved the Flemish scheme under EU State aid rules.\nThe non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the number SA.103704 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetitionwebsite once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024; Nina Ferreira - Tel.: +32 229 98163)\nAides d'État: la Commission autorise un régime wallon d'un montant de 200 millions d'euros visant à compenser les coûts des émissions indirectes supportés par les entreprises grandes consommatrices d'énergie\nLa Commission européenne a autorisé, en vertu des règles de l'UE en matière d'aides d'État, un régime wallon d'un montant de200 millions d'eurosdestiné à indemniser partiellement les entreprises grandes consommatrices d'énergie confrontées à une hausse des prix de l'électricité résultant de l'incidence des prix du carbone sur les coûts de production d'électricité (appelés «coûts des émissions indirectes»), supportés entre 2021 et 2030, dans le cadre dusystème d'échange de quotas d'émission de l'UE (ci-après le «SEQE»).\nLa mesure bénéficiera aux entreprises des secteurs exposés à un risque de fuite de carbone figurant à l'annexe I deslignes directrices concernant les aides d'État dans le contexte du SEQE. Ces secteurs sont confrontés à des coûts d'électricité importants et sont particulièrement exposés à la concurrence internationale. La compensation sera accordée aux entreprises admissibles à son bénéfice sous la forme d'unremboursement partiel des coûts des émissions indirectessupportés au cours de l'année précédente, le paiement final devant être effectué en 2031. En raison des circonstances exceptionnelles liées à la crise énergétique actuelle, le délai pour les paiements de 2021 est fixé au 31 mai 2023.\nLe montant maximal de l'aide par bénéficiaire sera égal à 75 % des coûts des émissions indirectes supportés. Afin d'encourager les économies d'énergie, le montant de l'aide est calculé sur la base de référentiels d'efficacité pour la consommation d'électricité. Pour pouvoir prétendre à une compensation, les bénéficiaires doivent soit i) mettre en œuvre certaines recommandations de l'audit énergétique, ii) couvrir au moins 30 % de leur consommation d'électricité à partir de sources d'énergie renouvelables ou iii) investir au moins 50 % du montant de l'aide dans des projets entraînant des réductions substantielles des émissions de gaz à effet de serre de leurs installations.\nLa Commission a apprécié la mesure au regard des règles de l'UE en matière d'aides d'État, et notamment deslignes directrices concernant les aides d'État dans le contexte du SEQE. La Commission a estimé que le régime était nécessaire et approprié pour aider les entreprises grandes consommatrices d'énergie à faire face à la hausse des prix de l'électricité et pour éviter que les entreprises ne se délocalisent vers des pays tiers aux politiques moins ambitieuses en matière de climat, ce qui se traduit par une augmentation des émissions de gaz à effet de serre à l'échelle mondiale. De plus, elle a constaté que le régime était conforme aux exigences définies dans les lignes directrices concernant les aides d'État dans le contexte du SEQE. Il soutient donc les objectifs climatiques et environnementaux de l'UE et les objectifs fixés dans lepacte vert pour l'Europe. Sur cette base, la Commission a autorisé le régime wallon en vertu des règles de l'UE en matière d'aides d'État.\nLa version non confidentielle de la décision sera publiée sous le numéro SA.103490 dans leregistre des aides d'Étatfigurant sur le site web de la Commission consacré à laconcurrence, dès que les éventuels problèmes de confidentialité auront été résolus.\n(Pour plus d'informations: Arianna Podesta – Tél.: +32 229 87024; Nina Ferreira - Tél.: +32 229 98163)\nState aid: Commission approves €110 million Italian scheme to encourage freight traffic to shift from road to rail\nThe European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €110 million Italian scheme to encourage freight traffic to shift from road to rail. The purpose of the scheme is to promote the modal shift of freight transport to rail, which is a greener mode of transport, and to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and road congestion.\nUnder the scheme, the aid will take the form of a direct grant. The scheme is open to (i) companies using intermodal and/or transhipped rail transport services, and (ii) multimodal transport operators who commission block trains running with electric traction system to railway undertakings. The maximum aid amount is €2.5 per train-km. The level of support reflects the external cost savings of rail transport compared to road transport. The scheme will run until 31 December 2027.\nThe Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular under Article 93 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and theGuidelines on State aid for railway undertakings. The Commission found that the scheme is necessary and proportionate to promote the use of rail transport, which is less polluting than road transport and contributes to reducing road congestion. The measure will therefore be beneficial both for the environment and for mobility. Furthermore, the Commission found that the aid will have an 'incentive effect' as the beneficiaries would not carry out the shift to the same extent in the absence of the public support. The Commission therefore concluded that the measure will contribute to facilitating the shift of freight transport from road to rail, in line with the objectives of theEU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategyand of theEuropean Green Deal. Furthermore, the Commission concluded that the scheme  is proportionate, as it is limited to the minimum necessary, and has a limited impact on competition and trade between Member States. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the Italian scheme is in line with EU State aid rules.\nThe non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.103856 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetition websiteonce any confidentiality issues have been resolved.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024;Nina Ferreira - Tel.: +32 229 98163)\nState aid: Commission approves modification of Italian scheme topromote rail freight transport in the Emilia-Romagna region\nThe European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, the modification of an Italian scheme to encourage the shift of freight transport from road to rail in the region of Emilia-Romagna.\nThe measure was originally approved by the Commissionin October 2019(SA.54990), and is set to expire in December 2022. The purpose of the scheme is to promote the modal shift of freight transport from road to rail, which is a greener mode of transport, and contribute to reduce CO2 emissions and road congestion.\nItaly notified to the Commission several amendments to the scheme, including: a prolongation until the end of 2027; a budget increase of €25 million, bringing the overall budget to €31 million; an increase of the maximum annual aid amount per beneficiary from €150,000 to €500,000; and an increase of the maximum unit aid amount from €0.7 to €1.16 per each tonne transported over the kilometres run within the regional territory. The amendments are aimed at enhancing the support to modal shift by providing operators with stronger incentives to switch to rail transport and more flexibility to adapt to possible changes in the intermodal chain.\nThe Commission assessed the amendments to the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particularArticle 93of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and theGuidelines on State aid for railway undertakings. The Commission found that the scheme continues to be necessary and appropriate to promote the use of rail transport in the densely populated and intensely industrialised Emilia-Romagna region at the crossroads of three Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. Furthermore, the Commission concluded that the measure continues to be proportionate, as it is limited to the minimum necessary, and to have a limited impact on competition and trade between Member States. On this basis, the Commission found that the modification of the scheme is in line EU State aid rules.\nThe non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.103202 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetition websiteonce any confidentiality issues have been resolved.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024;Nina Ferreira - Tel.: +32 229 98163)\nState aid: Commission approves €33 million Dutch scheme to support fishery sector in the context of Brexit\nThe European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €33 million Dutch scheme to support the fishery sector affected by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. The aim of the scheme is to compensate vessel owners for the losses suffered during a temporary cessation of their fishing activities between 1 January 2021 and 24 December 2022.\nUnder the scheme, aid will be granted to owners of eligible Netherlands-registered  vessels in the form of direct grants. The aid amount corresponds to the losses of income of the fishing vessel during the standstill periods, taking into account the average annual turnover of the concerned vessel during the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 and deducting the variable costs. The scheme will run until 31 December 2023. The measure is planned to be funded under theBrexit Adjustment Reserve, established to mitigate the economic and social impact of Brexit, subject to approval under the specific provisions governing funding from that instrument.\nThe Commission has assessed the scheme underArticle 107(3)(c)of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which allows Member States to support the development of certain economic activities or regions under certain conditions, and in particular theGuidelines for the examination of State aid to the fishery and aquaculture sector. The Commission found that the scheme facilitates the economic activity of fishing and does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest. On this basis, the Commission approved the Dutch measure under EU State aid rules.\nThe non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.104968 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetition websiteonce any confidentiality issues have been resolved.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 229 87024; Nina Ferreira - Tel.: +32 229 98163)\nAides d'État: la Commission autorise la modification d'un régime luxembourgeois visant à encourager le déplacement du transport routier de marchandises vers le rail et les voies navigables intérieures\nLa Commission a autorisé, en vertu des règles de l'UE en matière d'aides d'État, la modification d'un régime luxembourgeois visant à encourager le déplacement du transport routier de marchandises vers le rail et les voies navigables intérieures.\nCe régime, initialement autorisé par la Commission en juin 2015 (SA.38229), a été prolongé en juillet 2019 (SA.51613) et doit expirer le 31 décembre 2022. Il a pour objectifs de promouvoir le passage à d'autres solutions que la route pour le transport de marchandises, à savoir le transport ferroviaire et la navigation intérieure, des modes de transport plus écologiques, et de contribuer à réduire les émissions de CO2et la congestion des routes.\nLe Luxembourg a notifié à la Commission les modifications suivantes du régime: i) une prolongation jusqu'à la fin de 2027; ii) un nouveau budget pour la période de prolongation (environ 104 millions d'euros); iii) un élargissement de son champ d'application afin d'y inclure le transport ferroviaire intérieur conventionnel et le transport international conventionnel par voies navigables intérieures; et iv) une modification du mode de calcul des aides afin d'augmenter le soutien aux transbordements horizontaux dans le cadre des autoroutes ferroviaires.\nLa Commission a apprécié ces modifications au regard des règles de l'UE en matière d'aides d'État, et notamment de l'article 93du traité sur le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne et deslignes directrices de la Commission de 2008 sur les aides d'État aux entreprises ferroviaires. Elle a constaté que le régime continue d'être nécessaire et proportionné pour promouvoir l'utilisation des voies navigables intérieures et le transport ferroviaire, conformément aux objectifs de lastratégie de mobilité durable et intelligente de l'UEet duPacte vert pour l'Europe, sans fausser indûment la concurrence dans le marché unique. En outre, la Commission est parvenue à la conclusion que le régime continue d'être proportionné, car il est limité au minimum nécessaire, et qu'il a des incidences limitées sur la concurrence et les échanges entre les États membres. Sur cette base, la Commission a conclu que la modification du régime est compatible avec les règles de l'UE en matière d'aides d'État.\nLa version non confidentielle de la décision sera publiée sous le numéro SA.100326 dans leregistre des aides d'Étatfigurant sur le site web de la Commission consacré à laconcurrence, dès que les éventuels problèmes de confidentialité auront été résolus.\n(Pour plus d'informations: Arianna Podesta – Tél.: +32 229 87024; Nina Ferreira - Tél.: +32 229 98163)\nState aid: Commission approves amendments to Maltese schemes, including€4.5 million budget increase, to support the agricultural, fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine\nThe European Commission has found the amendments to two existing Maltese schemes to support the agricultural, fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine to be in line with the StateTemporary Crisis Framework, adopted by the Commission on23 March 2022and amended on20 July 2022and on28 October 2022.\nThe Commission approved the original schemes on16 June 2022(SA.103223) and14 July 2022(SA.103449). Malta notified the following modifications to the existing schemes: (i) an overallbudget increase by €4.5 million; (ii) an extension of the period, in relation to which aid may be granted, until 31 December 2023; and (iii) an increase of the maximum aid ceilings for limited amounts of aid in line with the Temporary Crisis Framework as amended on28 October 2022.\nThe Commission found that the schemes, as amended, continue to be in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis Framework. In particular, the aid (i) will not exceed €250,000 per beneficiary active in the primary production of agricultural products and €300,000 per beneficiary active in the fishery and aquaculture sectors; and (ii) will be granted no later than 31 December 2023. The Commission found that the Maltese schemes, as modified, remain necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line withArticle 107(3)(b) TFEUand the conditions set out in theTemporary Crisis Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the amended schemes under EU State aid rules.\nMore information on the Temporary Crisis Framework and other actions taken by the Commission to address the economic impact of Russia's war against Ukraine can be foundhere.

        "text": "Thank you very much Minister Nishimura for your warm welcome and trusted partnership.\nIt is a great honour for me to speak at this important event, so thank you for hosting it and for inviting me to address everyone.\nBy now, none of us are strangers to the impact of the climate crisis. This summer again, we have seen unprecedented droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires, and we have all been shocked by the devastating flooding in Pakistan.\nHere in Japan, the sheer force of super typhoon Nanmadol and the tragic loss of life it caused were very alarming.\nIt is as if every day, Mother Nature is reminding us that the window for action is closing very rapidly.\nWe urgently need to go beyond setting commitments, to deliver steep emissions reductions in the next few years.\nI am very pleased that the European Union and Japan are strong partners in this endeavour.\nThe EU's own green transformation is well underway.\nFollowing Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine, we are moving away from fossil fuels even quicker than before. To be more secure in our energy supply, we are saving energy and speeding up the transition to renewables.\nIn parallel, we are continuing our work to reduce emissions by at least 55% this decade. Our so-called Fit for 55 package strengthens climate and energy policy in nearly all economic sectors: from road transport and aviation to industry and the land sector.\nThanks to our Emissions Trading System, the EU has already cut 25% of emissions as compared to 1990. This cap-and-trade system has a proven track record for energy generation and heavy industry, and now we are strengthening the system to reduce emissions even faster. We will also introduce emissions trading for maritime, buildings, and road transport.\nTo avoid that our carbon emissions are pushed into other places – the so-called carbon leakage, we are also establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). This will put a price on the carbon-content of imported products made with high carbon emissions, such as steel and cement.\nThese are just a few examples of how we are using regulation to steer Europe's transition to net zero. In Japan, you are heading to the same destination, but with a different path.\nI am therefore eager and curious to see how the planned green transformation league will work, and what we can learn from you. As it is voluntary, it will be important to keep a close eye on how the approach delivers and maintain the option of regulation if that proves to be necessary.\nBecause time is of the essence.\nWe cannot afford to make mistakes or run into unwanted delays.\nI think the EU and Japan are very much on the same page in this regard, working closely together in a Green Alliance.\nIt is a partnership that we value enormously, and that will see us cooperate even closer on protecting the environment, restoring biodiversity, promoting the circular economy and fighting the climate crisis.\nWe are in this crisis together, and we can overcome it, together.\nありがとう\nArigato\nVideo:EC AV PORTAL (europa.eu)",

        "date": "Nov 2, 2023",
        "location": "Hanoi",
        "text": "Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\nGood afternoon to you all.(Xin chao quy vi  [Sin ciao qwee wi])\nThank you very much for these kind words of introduction and the invitation to the Green Economy Forum. I feel honoured to join such a list of distinguished speakers. And to talk about such an important topic.\nClimate change maybetheprime example of how we areallin the same boat.\nWe see it in typhoons hitting Đà Nẵng as much as we see it in the wildfires ravaging Athens. Or, most recently, in the floods hitting Ho Chi Minh City and sweeping through Madrid in a matter of months.\nLittle does it matter that we live on the opposite sides of the globe. Our destinies are linked more than ever before.\nSo, this discussion on the green economy and our opportunities for cooperation really matters.\nVietnam is not only an important partner for the EU in the Indo-Pacific region.  Above all, Vietnam is a very ambitious partner. You have set big goals – internationally and domestically:\nThose are not only impressive targets. They are, of course, linked.\nAnd I believe the EU is in a unique position to help you get there. Let me explain further.\n***\nEU-Vietnam trade as support to Vietnam's development ambitions\nStarting with the former. Vietnam has achieved rapid developmental progress over the last 40 years. You reached lower middle-income status in 2010 according to the IMF and the impressive development has continued since.\nOf course, the economy can be a complicated thing. Its performance is dependent on many different variables. But one thing is for sure: trade can be very powerful boost to the economy – if the conditions are right.\nThe EU and Vietnam already have strong economic ties. But we have managed to take them to a whole new level thanks to our Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). In fact, although it only entered into force in 2020, it is already a success story that is delivering real benefits on the ground. The numbers are impressive. In 2022, it led to an increase in trade flows by nearly 30%.\nThanks to the FTA, Vietnam's overall exports to the EU rose from EUR 34.5 billion in 2020 to EUR 51.5 billion in 2022. ThismakesVietnam the top EU partner in ASEAN for trade in goods!Meanwhile, trade in services amounted to EUR 7.2 bn in 2021.\nVietnam is benefiting greatly from the implementation of this agreement.It is currently exporting four times more to the EU than vice versa.\nBut I believe we can make it an even bigger success, once its implementation progresses further. In particular, we count on our Vietnamese partners to implement fully their commitments in the car, agriculturaland foodsectors.\nWe also trust Vietnam will soonfinalise the legislation on a predictable andpracticalregulatory framework for pharmaceuticals. And that there will be progress on the legislation allowingremanufactured goods, for instance. This is of particular importance as remanufactured goods contribute greatly to a smooth transition to a circular economy.\nMeanwhile, your leadership has made it clear that reaching your goals will also entail a series of core reforms. Labour rights are one piece of the big puzzle, that I believe can also unlock the power of trade further.\nIn that regard, we welcome Vietnam's ongoing reforms of its labour rules, in particular the ratification of 25 ILO conventions.\nOverall, I think it's safe to say that the EVFTA has been very positive so far. And I am pleased to host Minister Dien in Brussels on 1 December for the third Trade Committee under the EU-Vietnam FTA. This will allow us to further discuss our trade and investment relations in more detail.\nIn addition, Europe wants to extend its hand to the ASEAN region more widely. Our ultimate goal is one of a region-to-region agreement. And I think we now need to seize the opportunity and make it work.\nAt the same time, we all know that today, trade agreements are much more than tariffs and quotas. They are vehicles of cooperation to jointly address global challenges. They are about clean technologies and about resilient supply chains. In fact, they are platforms for cooperation.\nWhich takes me to my next point.\n***\nCooperation on green transition\nTrade doesn't exist in a vacuum. And it is a big part of the equation towards a greener future.\n2050 is a milestone  in the sand for both the EU and Vietnam.\nFor the EU, 2050 is perhaps the most important commitment of the European Green Deal. It is the year by which we aim to become the first climate neutral continent.\nVietnam, too, has declared its ambition to become net zero by that year.\nI see the green transition as a key area where we can work together. This is why we must support each other to speed up our transitions away from fossil fuels and towardsrenewable energy. Renewable energy is not only good for the climate, but it lessens dependence and improves security of supply.\nAt the EU-ASEAN summit in Brussels last year, the EU and Vietnam signed a Just Energy Transition Partnership. This is a major milestone in our joint efforts to fight climate change.\nI would like to use this opportunity and acknowledge the good cooperation with the Vietnamese government. I know you have followed the developments on European sustainability legislation under the Green Deal from anything like deforestation, due diligence to CBAM very closely. Let me thank you for yourpositiveattitude and constructive approach to these initiatives.I appreciate your cooperation towards achieving the aims of the EU deforestation regulation.We would welcome to cooperate onallthosesustainabilityissues. And we have heard yourinterest in technical assistance clearly. I will be working with my teams to see how we can best go about it.\nIn addition, we also want to cooperate on green technologies. The EU has worked hard on developing its green tech. And we are keen on sharing it with those who want to put it to good use. As an example, the EU and its Member States are sharing their know- how when providing support for climate resilient infrastructure (urban development, coastal erosion, water management). Concretely, we have provided  support for agricultural transformation in the Mekong delta. Another example would be the cooperation with Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) for the realisation of a number of clean energy transition projects, including the first hydropower pumped storage in Vietnam in Ninh Thuan province (Bac Ai). This has been a joint undertaking with EU Member States and European Development EVN. We have also made available EUR 16 m in grants for Technical Assistance, whichwill contributeto leverage at least EUR 1 billion in loans from financial institutions for large infrastructure investment projects crucial for the clean energy transition.\nMeanwhile, we are also eager to ensure that ourinvestmentshelp partner countries in their respective transitions. A prime example is the recent Lego factory investment in the Binh Duong province in southern Vietnam. This company aspires to be the first net zero company in the country. I understand it is making great strides towards its opening in 2024. And I was pleased to see the pictures from the celebration ceremony earlier this year to mark the completion of 50,000 trees planted on site.\nFurthermore,  Vietnam is playing an increasingly important role inglobal value and production chains. We are glad to see Vietnam's strong determination to become a hub of production of semi-conductors, and possibly a newly emerged big supplier of rare earths.\nVietnam has a young, talented and hardworking population, an important strategic geo-political position, abundant in resources ship. All these elements can materialise only if Vietnam creates the enabling environment for attracting the high-quality foreign investment. European companies are ready to invest – but the conditions need to be right.\n***\nLet me end with a few words on an EU flagship initiative, which I think can play a crucial roles in all of this – Global Gateway.\nMeeting the challenges of the transitions ahead of us will require enormous investments in infrastructure and people.\nAnd we all need to diversify our sources of investment.An appropriate regulatory framework to attract investments will be key in this context. Many investments will be private, and some will require public support to make them happen.\nThis is where Global Gateway comes in.\nGlobal Gateway is the EU's strategy to connect the world in a sustainable manner.  It stands for trusted connections that work for people and the planet. And it is about tackling the most pressing global challenges, from climate change and protecting the environment, to improving health security and boosting competitiveness and global supply chains.\nLast year, Team Europe put forward an investment package for ASEAN worth EUR 10 billion until 2027.\nIn Vietnam, the support under the Global Gateway provided by the EU and Member States, including by European Development Banks and private investors, focuses so far on renewable energy such as hydro power and near shore wind power installations, as well as on the construction of the first hydro power pumped storage station in Ninh Tuan Province.\nIf we want to link our zones of growth, we need to upgrade our economies. This relates to everything from clean energy to the digital infrastructure. We will support the integration of electricity infrastructure and electricity markets. We will cooperate on research and on academic exchange programmes.\nPerhaps most importantly, Global Gateway is about giving choices to countries – real choices. Because for many countries around the world, investment options are not only limited, but they can come with hidden strings attached. Global Gateway wants to create a genuine win-win for all partners involved.\n***\nIn conclusion, I am confident about the prospects for close cooperation between Europe and Vietnam – and Southeast Asia more broadly.\nI look forward to many exciting conversations today.\nThank you.",

        "location": "Lisbon",
        "text": "Thank you João, good afternoon everyone.\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for inviting us to the beautiful city of Lisbon.Muito obrigado!\nAfter more than a year of economic pain, Europe's recovery is stepping up a gear.\nLast week, the European Commission upgraded the spring economic forecast. We projected growth of 4.2% for the EU economy this year, and 4.4% growth next year.\nEven though growth rates are likely to vary, all EU countries should see their economies return to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2022.\nFiscal policy should remain supportive both this year and next, as the minister already outlined - and also based on the spring economic forecast, we can confirm our approach that we would keep the general escape clause activated in 2022 and but no longer as of 2023.\nWe used this Ecofin to have more strategic, more conceptual discussions about the risks and challenges that lie ahead in the context of the economic recovery.\nLike other crises before, this one has left some unwelcome legacies: higher public and private debt, negative impact on social and labour markets, just to give some examples.\nMaintaining extensive liquidity support for too long would carry budgetary risks in itself.\nBut on the other hand, we should also avoid sudden, premature or uncoordinated removal of temporary support measures.\nEurope's banks, along with the entire financial sector, will play an\nimportant role in ensuring a successful and uniform economic recovery.\nSo far, the strong EU and national policy response has kept company insolvencies at bay and non-performing loans relatively low on banks' balance sheets.\nWe will do our best to keep things that way.\nBut it will be an area to watch closely.\nAnd we will need to ensure the right balance as we coordinate between different crisis and recovery measures.\nThis is why the Recovery and Resilience Facility is so important.\nIt will lead us to solid and safer ground as we enter the post-crisis phase. Now we need to put it in place and get the funds flowing.\nThe watchword for the coming months will beimplementation.\nSo far, we have received 18 plans, and more should arrive soon.\nOur aim is to see RRF funds flowing already in the summer. They will provide a massive growth stimulus to Europe's economy, while not adding to national debts and deficits.\nWhat we see so far in the plans looks quite promising:\nWe are now in contact with Member States that have submitted plans to go over the details so that we can finalise the assessments.\nWe know Member States are now anxious to receive the pre-financing as fast as possible.\nWe are working from the European Commission side as fast as we can. But these are complex assessments.\nWe have to get it right. The plans have to stand the test of time and lead to a positive overhaul of our economies.\nWe have two months and we will try to accelerate things a bit.\nBut it's also worth remembering that Member States – the Council - also need one month for their assessment.\nNow let me say a few words about another important discussion we had today: on the future of environmental taxation.\nThis will play an important role in our journey to a climate-neutral Europe as part of the European Green Deal.\nIt reflects our commitment to tackling climate change. And it will contribute to long-term sustainable growth as part of the recovery.\nWe all agreed on some key points, that green taxation can:\nIn July, the Commission intends to overhaul the relevant EU climate and energy legislation aligned with our more ambitious 55% emission reduction target for 2030.\nSo we will put forward the so-called “Fit for 55” package.\nThis will include a proposal for revising our outdated Energy Taxation Directive and a proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism – or CBAM.\nThe CBAM - as the minister already explained - is an environmental measure. It will address the risk of carbon leakage by equalising the prices of carbon paid for domestic and imported products. It should incentivise greater use of carbon pricing globally - and that would be a good way to fight climate change.\nOf course, it's not going to be easy.\nBut we are confident that we can get a consensus on a targeted CBAM proposal that is gradual over time, and WTO compliant. And we will obviously also strive to make it efficient.\nThere is also broad support for a revision of our Energy Taxation Directive and an acknowledgement that we will need to consider including sectors such as aviation and maritime.\nThank you and later, we will be available for your questions.",

        "text": "The European Commission adopted today the rules governing the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) during its transitional phase, which starts on 1 October of this year and runs until the end of 2025.\nTheImplementing Regulationpublished today details the transitional reporting obligations for EU importers of CBAM goods, as well as the transitional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of CBAM goods.\nIn the CBAM's transitional phase, traders will only have to report on the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism without paying any financial adjustment. This will give adequate time for businesses to prepare in a predictable manner, while also allowing for the definitive methodology to be fine-tuned by 2026.\nTo help both importers and third country producers, the Commission also published todayguidancefor EU importers and non-EU installations on the practical implementation of the new rules. At the same time, dedicated IT tools to help importers perform and report these calculations are currently being developed, as well as training materials, webinars and tutorials to support businesses when the transitional mechanism begins. While importers will be asked to collect fourth quarter data as of 1 October 2023, their first report will only have to be submitted by 31 January 2024.\nAhead of its adoption by the Commission, the Implementing Regulation was subject to a publicconsultationand was subsequently approved by the CBAM Committee, composed of representatives from EU Member States. One of the central pillars of the EU's ambitiousFit for 55 Agenda, CBAM is the EU's landmark tool to fight carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs when companies based in the EU move carbon-intensive production abroad to take advantage of lower standards, or when EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports, which in turn undermines our climate action.\nFor more information\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)",

As Minister, I worked closely with colleagues, on the Capital Markets Union, SURE, weapons for Ukraine...\nI have always tried to bring the national and European interest together.\nAnd yet I want to acknowledge that precisely this did not always go well.\nAt the start of the pandemic, I showed insufficient regard for the difficulties faced by some Member States. I would like you to know that I feel that I should have done that differently.\nNow again, on climate change, it is time to show solidarity – in the EU, across the world, and with future generations.\nClimate change is a massive challenge.\nAnd their future depends on our decisions.\nHonourable members,\nAs Commissioner, I will be driven by facts, by numbers, by science, and I will be convinced by evidence.\nBut I will also be adamant in giving a voice to the next generation.\nLike for many of you, this is not an abstract reality for me.\nAt least once a week, my children ask me about two things: the war in Ukraine, and climate change.\nWhether these kids are sitting at my kitchen table, at yours, or frankly speaking, anywhere else in the world: they deserve a future.\nHonourable members,\nAs Commissioner, I would aim forcontinuity, forambition, and foroutreach.\nThis Parliament has been pivotal in setting our continent firmly on track towards climate neutrality in 2050.\nThe EU Climate Law and Fit for 55 simplyknow no parallel.\nWith the European Green Deal, President von der Leyen and former Executive Vice-President Timmermans laid the foundations for Europe's green transformation.\nI want to assure you that continuity is in place on theentireGreen Deal.\nIn my own portfolio, I aim to swiftly concludeallpending negotiations.\nBut I will not be a caretaker.\nIt simply wouldn't do justice to the scale, to the magnitude of our challenge and frankly speaking, it's not in my nature.\nWe are running a marathon here, not a sprint.\nThrough the climate portfolio, I want to prepare the foundations of a Green Deal 2.0, on climate, biodiversity, circularity, and pollution, and help increase ambition across the board.\nTo build this path, and to profit from it, Europe needs ambition and predictability.\nEsteemed members,\nIn the first quarter of next year, we will present our Communication on the 2040-target.\nThe Scientific Advisory Board has already published compelling evidence.\nWith recommendations on technological feasibility, on removals, on environmental risk limits, international cooperation, and fairness, the Board advises a minimum target of 90% net reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.\nNaturally, we will do a thorough impact assessment and analyse different scenarios, reduction pathways, costs and benefits.\nIcannotpre-empt this work, nor the final College decision.\nBut Icanoffer you my clear commitment:\nI will act in line with the Board's advice.\nI will useallinstruments available to aim to enable the EU to reach the minimum recommended target of 90% net reductions.\nAnd I will work to bring our industry along, with instruments like the Innovation Fund to spur innovation, and using CBAM to help create a truly global level playing field.\nHonourable Members,\nClimate change is a global crisis.\nWe cannot master it alone.\nAt COP28, discussions will centre on ambition and finance.\nBoth are closely linked: the more money we can muster, the more ambition we can elicit.\nWith Fit for 55, Europe leads the world in ambitionandimplementation.\nAnd by providing the largest share of climate finance, we lead the world in solidarity.\nBut the harsh reality is that the Paris goals are far from fulfilled.\nTo unlock more mitigation ambition, notably from major emitters, we need progress on adaptation and finance, of course including loss and damage.\nThis is, in the end, not only about money, but about restoring trust.\nThe EU created a breakthrough last year. We can do this again. If we look at unorthodox solutions and dare to flip the script.\nCOP28 shouldoperationalisethe loss and damage fund and funding arrangements, especially for the most vulnerable.\nIt is doable,ifwe find agreement on the governance and the operating rules.\nIf this is the case, first pledges will become possible, and I will prepare the ground accordingly.\nBut, for structural funding we need systematic revenue.\nIdeas from the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact last June must become reality.\nI will talk to all partners to build a global loss and damage coalition.\nI want to explore an international kerosene tax, a maritime levy, a fossil fuels tax, even a share of ETS proceeds – no stone should be left unturned.\nAnd still, we cannot leave Dubai without more mitigation ambition. If only because no amount of money can actually pay for the damage that will be there if we overshoot Paris.\nThe EU should lead by example.\nWith Fit for 55, we are set to reduce 57% emissions by 2030.\nAnd to spur extra ambition abroad, I will champion the EU's push to triple global renewable energy capacity, double energy efficiency, and phase out unabated fossil fuels.\nFossil fuels must becomehistory.\nThe sooner, the better.\nThe fact that certain oil majors have long known of their role in climate change, and sought to hide the evidence… I find it truly unethical.\nIf anything, it increases their responsibility to contribute to solving climate change.\nAnd we should engage with them exactly along these very lines.\nI want to be honest.\nThe geopolitical situation we're facing is grim.\nIt will not improve soon, and it weighs on our climate diplomacy and the effectiveness of our climate ambition.\nBut public expectations for COP28 are high, and rightly so.\nAnd time is running out.\nWemustget the world on track for 1.5 degrees.\nI still see avenues to success in Dubai, and I will work non-stop to make it happen.\nSehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete,\nin zwei Bereichen benötigen wir weitere Maßnahmen: im Luftverkehr und bei den Subventionen für fossile Brennstoffe.\nIch bin mir bewusst, dass die Verhandlungen über das Emissionshandelssystem für die Luftfahrt, um CORSIA und um nachhaltige Kraftstoffe gerade erst abgeschlossen worden sind.\nUnd doch… doch sind größere Anstrengungen notwendig, um die Umweltverschmutzung und die Emissionen durch den Luftverkehr aufzuhalten.\nBeginnen wir mit der, aus meiner Sicht, größten Absurdität: der fehlenden Besteuerung von Flugbenzin.\nWenn ich ein Auto an die Tankstelle fahre, sind 50 bis 60% von dem, was ich an der Kasse bezahle, Steuern.\nAber wird ein Jet aufgetankt, fallen überhaupt keine Steuern an. Null.\nWelcher Europäer hält das für sinnvoll – dass wirausgerechnetbeim Kerosinnichtnach dem Verursacherprinzip handeln?\nSchon während meiner Zeit als Finanzminister drängten die Niederlande auf die Flugsteuer in Europa.\nHeute möchte ich mit aller Kraft in Europa – und auf der ganzen Welt – um Unterstützung für eine globale Luftverkehrsabgabe werben.\nWir müssen darüber hinausendlichdie Subventionen für fossile Brennstoffe beenden!\nSie sind, aus meiner Sicht, anachronistisch und kontraproduktiv für unsere Energiewende.\nIch möchte eng mit Kommissar Gentiloni zusammenarbeiten, um die Energiebesteuerungsrichtlinie im Rat voranzubringen.\nNatürlich, ich weiß sehr gut, nur zu gut, wie schwierig es sein kann, Steuerpolitik zu verändern.\nAber hat Italien, mit der globalen Mindeststeuer, nicht schon in seiner G20-Präsidentschaft bewiesen, dass es zu schaffen ist?\nMeine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete,\ndie Klimapolitik ist eng mit den anderen Säulen des Green Deal verbunden.\nDies gilt für die Artenvielfalt, das Naturwiederherstellungsgesetz, das Bodengesetz und das kommende Waldmonitoringgesetz.\nUm unsere Klimaziele zu erreichen, müssen wir den Green Deal vollenden.\nUnsere Böden, Ozeane und Wälder sind die größten Kohlenstoffsenken.\nUnd eine gesunde Natur wird uns auf unserem Planeten, der immer wärmer wird, einfach kühl halten.\nIch unterstütze Kommissar Sinkevicius voll dabei, unsere ambitionierten Umweltgesetze über die Ziellinie zu bringen.\nUnd ich verspreche, im Klimaressort meinen Teil dazu beizutragen.\nVor allem müssen wir eng mit unseren Landwirten zusammenarbeiten.\nSie sollen unterstützt werden, nachhaltig zu produzieren, und sie haben einen Anspruch auf ein angemessenes Auskommen.\nDarum müssen wir unseren Landwirten ein überarbeitetes Geschäftsmodell anbieten.\nDazu werde ich ganz bewusst den Dialog mit der Lebensmittelindustrie, und den Banken suchen.\nHonourable Members,\nEurope's green transition is a massive task.\nIt needs the broadest possible support, to maintain ambition and to take everyone along.\nI will set my own bar high - for reaching out; for building coalitions; for working together.\nI will work with you.\nWith my colleagues in the Commission.\nWith the Council.\nWith European citizens, civil society, and business.\nAnd with our partners across the globe.\nHonourable Members, monsieur le président,\nI hope that I have shown you, that as Commissioner, my focus would be on continuity, on ambition, and on outreach.\nThat I will be guided by science and always be the voice of the next generation.\nReaching climate neutrality in Europe by 2050 will be a steep climb.\nConvincing our partners across the world to keep pace with us will, frankly speaking, be even harder.\nBut there is no alternative. And we can get it done.\nTogether.\nThank you.\nLink to full speechhere.",

        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Good afternoon.\nLet me begin with the big picture.\nThe world is changing in front of our eyes.\nWe see dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape.\nThis week alone, we saw a long-standing strategic partner vote against a UN resolution condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\nWe need to treat these developments as a call to action.\nThe freedoms that we enjoy and the values that we cherish can no longer be taken for granted in a complex and more conflictual world.\nFor the EU, they also depend on maintaining and further developing our economic base by adapting, innovating, and competing in the world.\nIn short, we need to build a more competitive Europe.\nEarlier today, our colleagues presented the Clean Industrial Deal and an action plan to bring down energy prices as part of that effort.\nCutting red tape is another important element to achieve a more competitive Europe.\nPut simply, we cannot hope or expect to successfully compete in a perilous world with one hand behind our backs.\nThe past five years have been a period of intense regulatory activity.\nAnd our commitment to securing the green transition has not wavered, but at the same time, we must acknowledge that this has come at a cost, generating a large regulatory burden on people and businesses.\nAs we take stock, we see that this accumulation of rules, and their increased complexity, are limiting our economic potential and our prosperity.\nToday, regulation is seen by more than 60% of EU companies as an obstacle to investment.\n55% of SMEs are flagging regulatory obstacles and administrative burdens as their greatest challenge.\nAs you know, in Europe, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute approximately 99% of all businesses.\nThey are most at risk of being suffocated by administrative burdens.\nAt the same time, they are Europe's economic engine, for whom we are speaking and acting with today's proposals.\nI also want to be very clear that we remain deeply committed to building a greener and fairer society and economy.\nSimplification is about making sure that EU rules help deliver – rather than impede – the achievement of our economic, social, environmental and security goals.\nIt is about achieving those goals in a smarter and less burdensome way.\nLess bureaucracy means more innovation and investment that will secure our long-term prosperity.\nIt means creating new and quality jobs for European workers.\nIt provides citizens with the opportunity to stay, live and work in any region of Europe, from Portugal to Finland.\nToday's simplification proposals also help to ensure that responsible European companies can continue to invest and do business across the world.\nThe alternative would be retreating and ceding the ground to competitors who do not necessarily share our values nor working methods.\nTaken all together, that is why we have committed to this ambitious and far-reaching simplification agenda.\nNow let me now outline today's proposals.\nCompanies and stakeholders have repeatedly stressed the need to ensure certainty.\nToday, we proposed a “stop-the-clock” to delay the application of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for companies that have not started reporting yet.\nWe also proposed to delay the transposition and application of corporate sustainability due diligence (CSDDD).\nThis seeks to avoid a situation in which companies that are required under CSRD to report for the 2025 financial year (second wave) or 2026 (third wave) are then subsequently relieved of this requirement, incurring unnecessary and avoidable costs.\nWe will propose to the co-legislators to subject this proposal to a fast-track adoption.\nMoving to sustainability reporting.\nFirstly, we are freeing around 80% of companies currently under the scope of the CSRD from very burdensome reporting requirements.\nSecondly, we are limiting the information that larger companies under the scope of the CSRD can request from smaller companies not in scope – benefitting especially SMEs.\nThirdly, we will review the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, with a view to streamlining them substantially and making them easier for companies to use.\nFinally, we are lifting the mandate to adopt sectoral-specific standards and the possibility of moving from a requirement for limited assurance to a requirement for reasonable assurance.\nWe are therefore providing clarity that there will be no future increase in auditing costs for companies in scope related to sectoral-specific standards and the possibility of moving from a requirement for limited assurance to reasonable.\nOn due diligence, we are extending the scope of maximum harmonisation, targeting due diligence, as a general rule, to direct business partners.\nAt the same time, the proposal recognises that there can be situations where companies have to look beyond their direct business partners when, for instance, they become aware of possible harmful activities at the level of an indirect supplier.\nWe are extending the intervals in which companies need to regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of due diligence measures, from one to five years.\nThis will significantly reduce burdens not just for in-scope companies but also for their business partners, which would receive detailed information requests as part of these monitoring exercises.\nRegarding penalties, we are moving towards a more proportionate regime, that shall be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, and no longer linked to a percentage of global net turnover.\nFinally, we are moving away from the EU-wide civil liability regime conditions while preserving the right to full compensation for victims under the civil liability regimes of Member States.\nLastly, I turn to Taxonomy.\nToday the College proposed making Taxonomy reporting more proportionate, proposing that only very large companies, meaning above 1,000 employees, and €450 million turnover, are required to report every year on their Taxonomy alignment.\nThis amendment will free more than 80% of companies from compulsory Taxonomy reporting.\nWe are also presenting unprecedented simplification changes to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nWe are doing this on basis of reporting and data gathered during the CBAM transitional phase where we learnt that tens of thousands of small importers were subject to the CBAM, but their imports represented only about 1% of CO2 emissions.\nWith a new threshold we are eliminating CBAM obligations for approximately 182,000 or 90% of importers, most of which are SMEs.\nThis is expected to bring about €1.12 billion in savings while still covering over 99% emissions in scope.\nThe new threshold will also bring cost savings to public authorities in Member States worth approximately €87.5 million, through less processing of importers who are now exempt.\nThis is a clear example of the win-win scenario that simplification can bring about: achieving our green objectives while strengthening our economy.\nTurning to today's second Omnibus.\nWe also propose to optimise and simplify the functioning of several investment instruments including InvestEU, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and other legacy financial instruments.\nAgain, this proposal is breaking new ground.\nFirst, it entails a substantial reduction of administrative burden for our implementing partners, financial intermediaries and final recipients, notably the SMEs.\nThese simplification measures are expected to generate a total of around €350 million in cost savings.\nSecondly, we also propose measures to increase the real investment capacity under InvestEU to mobilise around €50 billion in additional public and private investments.\nThis will help address existing and emerging new priorities and direct the additional investment capacity in support of priority policies, such as the ones outlined in our Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal.\nTo conclude, today's first two omnibus packages mark a strong start to delivering our simplification agenda.\nA conservative estimate puts the annual savings stemming from these two packages at €6.3 billion.\nOur next proposals will target small mid-caps, farmers and changing paper reporting into a digital one.\nWe are determined to deliver.\nOur future prosperity and security depend on us taking action now.\nI will stop here. Thank you.",

        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Executive Vice-President Teresa Ribera\nThank you very much, Paula. And thanks all of you for being here.\nWe have worked a lot. It has been a very productive Commission meeting. We promised a Clean Industrial Deal within 100 days, and here we are on the 88-day delivering it. Ensuring that we have the right answers in a world that is changing, shifting fast and so must we.\nOur vision is for Europe to lead as a clean manufacturing power. Europe needs real and concrete responses. We need a Clean, Competitive and Just transition.\nWe are here to act, deliver results, and to stay true to our values. We know that our industry deserves a bright future, and we need to invest right now because the future starts today. Europe has many strengths and we are ideally positioned to deliver. We have developed a proposal, and we seek the active involvement of Member States and social stakeholders.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal is Europe's business plan to tackle the climate crisis, boost the competitiveness, ensure economic resilience and retain talent. Especially the talent of our youth. The Clean Industrial Deal is a long-lasting proposal to keep Europe as an attractive hub for traditional industries, accelerating new clean technologies and circular business models that can compete worldwide.\nIt is a commitment to our people. It is a commitment to create quality jobs, building skills and offering opportunities for all – especially young Europeans.\nIt is a concrete and tangible document that lists short- and medium-term actions, providing the certainty and predictability that Europe needs to build trust.\nTrust unlocks investments, boosts demand markets for clean tech and provides the conditions for companies to grow and compete at a level playing field.\nWe came up with an integrated approach, ensuring that all the relevant EU policy tools are aligned and work in the same direction, complementing each other and providing the best conditions to invest in the European Union.\nThis is why we work to ensure: (i) Access to affordable energy; (ii) Boosting clean supply and demand; (iii) Mobilising public and private investments; (iv) Powering the circular economy; (v) Fostering international partnerships; and (vi) Upskilling workers with quality jobs and ensuring social fairness.\nTo ensure access to affordable energy, today we have also adopted the first deliverable: an Action Plan for Affordable Energy that will be introduced by Commissioner Jorgensen later on. Paying attention on how we can make energy bills more affordable,  ensure a well-functioning gas markets and build on an Energy Union effectively interconnected.\nWe need to be consistent with taxation. Recommending lower taxation in electricity if we want to electrify. Minding the importance of a more intense, smart and effective use of the grids and energy infrastructure, if we want to lower the fixed cost of our system.\nThinking on de-risking for investments. Thinking on how we play with corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for an indicative amount of €500 million to cover PPAs. Thinking on how we can work with the EIB also in terms of providing a grid manufacturing package and being clear for strengthening our grids and interconnectors systems. Counting on well-functioning and transparent gas markets and providing a level playing field for all.\nCompetition tools do also play an integral part in keeping gas markets competitive, ensuring a level playing field among price setters and offtakers as well as supporting Member States when designing the responses in situations of extreme price spikes or exceptional price environments to decouple the transition of high gas prices into electricity prices.\nThe right answers in the right relevant markets to ensure the level playing field and the benefits that it provides to consumers have always been a key driver for competition policy. It is still the case but as I said the world is changing, so are the markets and so must we.\nCompetition policy can also help in leveraging access to finance, with the aim to crowd in private investment and to ensure a level playing field across the Single Market.\nThis is why we will facilitate an investment-friendly environment through a new State aid framework, which will simplify and expedite support for renewable energy, industrial decarbonisation, and the manufacturing of clean tech products, ensuring effective use of public funds and encouraging private sector involvement.\nIt will also encourage Member States to implement tax incentives such as accelerated depreciation periods to make clean investments more financially attractive to businesses.\nWe have to build on the lessons learnt from the ongoing Important Project of Common European Interest to simplify and speed up the ones to come by assisting Member States more actively in the design phase, and by facilitating access to finance.\nWe aim to identify a Joint Roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation pointing up to€ 100 billion in funding, based on available funds in the Innovation Fund, additional revenues resulting from parts of the Emission Trading System as well as the revision of InvestEU, according to the rules and the identification of the European Competitiveness Fund in the Competitiveness Compass.\nOur deal also places a strong focus on strengthening the availability of raw materials to ensure economic security and resilience. This also means improving our domestic policies to promote the efficient use of materials by placing circularity at the core of our decarbonisation strategy and also at the core of our industrial aims. This will not only improve the affordability and accessibility of essential materials but also reduce our dependencies.\nOur deal establishes a framework that places circularity at its core. We will adopt a Circular Economy Act to accelerate the circular transition, leveraging our single market, enhancing the availability of key resources, driving innovation and creating fit for purpose conditions.\nIn addition, we will need to achieve our goals in close cooperation with our ability to act internationally.\nEurope cannot realise its clean industrialisation objectives without partnerships on the global stage as well as without protecting the level playing field for our companies.\nWe will implement new Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships as a fast, flexible, targeted approach to trade, tailored to the concrete business interests of the EU and our partner countries.\nHowever, it is clear that for a transition to a clean and digital economy we will need to count on the people. We need to ensure that this transformation is just and inclusive. We are committed to ensuring that the benefits of this transition are shared by the whole society.\nThe transformation of our industry requires skilled people and quality jobs.\nSkills and quality jobs will be the foundation of an inclusive and equitable green transition, especially for regions reliant on high-carbon industries.\nThe shift to a clean energy is already creating jobs. By 2030, the EU's renewable targets alone will generate over 3.5 million new jobs in the renewable sector, offering a bright future to the workers and to the SMEs.\nBut this transition means change - some sectors will need to facing challenging circumstances. This is why we need to identify future-oriented skills, decent working conditions, and quality jobs for all.\nTo support workers in the transition we are further looking into social and upskilling conditionalities. We are trying to find how we can improve our capacity to monitor progress in implementing just transition policies.\nWe are well positioned to achieve more championing progress, performance, and sustainable growth rooted in our values.\nAnd I am convinced that our industries and workers will benefit from this revolution.\nI now pass the floor to my Colleague Executive Vice – President Séjourné and later on Commissioner Hoekstra.\nVice-président exécutif Stéphane Séjourné\nMerci, Chère Teresa.\nMesdames et Messieurs,\nAujourd'hui, l'Europe a décidé de mettre les moyens pour sa décarbonation, et sa réindustrialisation. Plus de 100 milliards d'euros en tout.\nEt pour cause : à l'heure où certains veulent nous imposer leur modèle - d'où qu'il vienne - la meilleure réponse, c'est d'abord de renforcer le nôtre.\nCar décarboner notre industrie n'est pas seulement une question environnementale. C'est aussi une stratégie de croissance et un impératif de sécurité.\nAssocier décarbonation et industrialisation, c'est faire le choix d'un modèle européen unique qui vise à renforcer la compétitivité, créer des emplois, et assurer la prospérité de tous les européens – partout à travers l'Europe.\nC'est tout l'objet du Pacte pour une industrie propre, que Teresa, Wopke et moi vous présentons aujourd'hui : c'est un engagement fort pour une production industrielle « made in Europe », durable et compétitive.\nL'attente est très forte. C'est confirmé par chaque visite de site industriel que je fais - toutes les semaines depuis le début de ce mandat.\nEn un mot, il faut produire plus, et il faut produire mieux. Et produire mieux, ça veut dire produire décarboné, et produire européen.\nCe pacte, c'est en quelque sorte le business plan de l'industrie européenne bas-carbone. Et aujourd'hui je vais vous présenter les quatre grandes lignes de ce business plan : la demande, les coûts, les financements et les inputs.\nLa demande, d'abord.\nSemaine après semaine, j'entends la même chose des entrepreneurs et des employés que je rencontre : nous avons fait des efforts pour décarboner, mais il n'y a pas assez de demande en acier propre, ou en ciment propre.\nLa priorité est donc de dynamiser le marché du bas-carbone en Europe. Pour cela, il faut stimuler la demande.\nCe Pacte propose de repenser totalement la logique de l'achat public, jusqu'ici basée sur le seul critère du prix.\nOn introduira de nouveaux critères de durabilité, de résilience et de préférence européenne dans les marchés publics, et plus généralement dans les aides publiques.\nNous viserons également les marchés privés, tels que les flottes de véhicules d'entreprises.\nDeuxième ligne du business plan: les coûts.\nNos sites industriels font tous face au même problème: des prix de l'énergie trop élevés.\nLa raison, on la connait : le marché de l'électricité est volatile, ce qui contribue à augmenter le prix des factures. Il faut donc permettre aux sites les plus intensifs en énergie de s'extraire de cette volatilité.\nAvec Teresa Ribera et Dan Jorgensen, nous proposerons de renforcer les contrats d'achat d'énergie de long terme.\nNous lançons dans les prochaines semaines un projet pilote avec la Banque Européenne d'Investissement, qui pour la première fois garantira ces contrats d'achat d'énergie. On mise sur une augmentation de la demande en contrats de long terme.\nCeci doit: accroître la production d'énergie propre européenne, découpler les prix de l'électricité de ceux du gaz, et promouvoir la sécurité énergétique en Europe.\nTroisième ligne du business plan:  les financements.\nL'idée est simple: on accompagne financièrement les secteurs industriels qui font le pas, et jouent le jeu, de leur décarbonation. Et on le fait conjointement – institutions européennes, États-membres, autorités publiques et entreprises privées. Parce que pour électrifier une aciérie, par exemple, on a besoin de tous ces acteurs, et de mettre e synergie l'ensemble des acteurs.\nPour cela, on touche en particulier à trois sources de financement: les fonds européens, la mobilisation des fonds privés, et les aides d'état qu'a déjà évoqué Teresa.\nD'abord, les fonds européens.\nNous prévoyons de renforcer les capacités du fonds pour l'innovation dont Wopke parlera.\nMais aussi mobiliser des fonds privés principalement par InvestEU, dont la garantie permettra de lever davantage d'argent privé. Grâce à de bonnes mesures de simplification nous augmentons d'ailleurs aujourd'hui sa force de frappe de 50 milliards d'euros, dont 25 peuvent être directement mobilisés pour la décarbonation.\nQuatrième et dernière ligne du business plan: les inputs.\nJe commencerai par un élément central de toute équation industrielle : l'achat de matières premières.\nNous avons deux objectifs : diminuer la facture en matières premières, et limiter nos dépendances.\nIl faut être très clair : nous devons être beaucoup plus stratégiques dans notre politique d'achat, et de production, de matières premières.\nCela passe d'abord par le fait de sécuriser notre propre extraction, et exploitation de métaux rares. Les sous-sols européens contiennent de nombreuses matières encore inexploitées.\nA l'heure où je vous parle, nos services sont en train de finaliser une liste de plusieurs dizaines de projets d'exploitation de matières premières, aux quatre coins d'Europe.\nIl s'agit de projets: d'extraction, de production, de recyclage, ou encore de constitution de stocks stratégiques sur notre sol.\nEn parlant de recyclage, ce Pacte possède un volet de mesures dédiées à la circularité des matières premières. Or aujourd'hui l'Europe sous-exploite ce marché.\nPour y remédier, nous inciterons dans la loi sur l'économie circulaire à garder les déchets de nos matières premières critiques en Europe. Il n'est pas normal qu'aujourd'hui l'Europe exporte la black mass des batteries, qu'elle rachète ensuite reconditionnée au prix fort.\nEnfin, nous proposons de créer une plateforme d'achat commun de matières premières. Et donc décider ensemble à qui on achète, comment, et à quel prix.\nOn doit faire avec le lithium ou le cobalt ce qu'on a fait avec les vaccins Covid.\nCe qui m'amène à mon dernier point. Comme cela a déjà été dit, l'Europe est un joueur, pas un terrain de jeu.\nNous devons utiliser plus systématiquement nos outils de défense commerciale.\nPar un renforcement des règles régissant les subventions étrangères, dont nos entreprises sont les premières victimes.\nEt par l'introduction de nouvelles conditions aux investissements étrangers sur notre sol - par exemple, sur la propriété intellectuelle.\nUne chose est sure : l'Europe doit devenir LA destination mondiale pour les investissements en technologies propres. Mais chaque deal doit un être un deal gagnant/gagnant.\nUne partie des nouvelles mesures de ce pacte seront reprises et appliquées à certains secteurs clés. C'est tout l'objet des plans d'action sectoriels que nous présenterons d'ici peu: sur le secteur automobile (dès la semaine prochaine), sur l'acier et le métal, sur la chimie, sur le transport durable, et sur la bioéconomie. Puis il faudra aussi traiter particulièrement le secteur de l'aéronautique qui - je le sais - fait des efforts de décarbonation, avec des vrais projets qu'il faudra continuer à soutenir.\nJe terminerai juste par un mot sur les premiers omnibus de simplification, dont mes collègues Valdis et Maria Luis parleront plus en détails.\nDans cette même pièce, j'ai eu l'occasion de rappeler le mot d'ordre de notre doctrine économique : la compétitivité.\nCette bataille de la compétitivité se gagne sur tous les fronts. Celui de l'investissement. Celui du prix de l'énergie. Celui de l'innovation. Celui de la productivité.\nEt évidemment: celui du cadre réglementaire.\nL'Europe a une réglementation prévisible. L'Europe a un système juridique, qui assure les droits des entreprises, des travailleurs et des investisseurs.\nDans un monde où les acteurs économiques sont de plus en plus soumis à l'arbitraire de certains politiques, c'est un atout indéniable. L'Europe doit rester cet îlot de stabilité et de droit.\nMais il est vrai, qu'au fil des ans, nous avons créé beaucoup de nouvelles obligations. Parfois en silo. Parfois redondantes. Parfois, sans tenir compte du quotidien des entreprises.\nCela a brouillé les objectifs.\nAvec ces textes, nous démontrons trois choses :\n1. L'Europe est un continent où il fait bon faire du business. Avec des règles claires, adaptées, pragmatiques.\n2. L'Europe sait se réformer. Sans tronçonneuse mais avec des hommes et des femmes compétents, qui écoutent les acteurs économiques.\n3. L'Europe sait simplifier sans renier ces objectifs.\nCet omnibus ne remet PAS en cause la décarbonation et notre objectif de 2050. Au contraire, nous simplifions la finance durable et les règles pour qu'elle soit vraiment utilisées.\nLa réforme d'InvestEU va permettre de générer jusqu'à 50 milliards d'investissements. La réforme du CBAM permettra de se concentrer vraiment sur les produits carbonés.\nIl s'agit donc d'une première étape dans ce mouvement de simplification.\nD'ici la fin du printemps, je présenterai un nouvel omnibus qui simplifiera la vie des PME et des ETI. Ainsi qu'une nouvelle stratégie sur le marché unique. Car il n'est pas de meilleure simplification que de renforcer notre marché unique.\nMerci.\nCommissioner Wopke Hoekstra\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nGood afternoon to all of you,\nMany thanks to Teresa and Stéphane for the excellent collaboration and for their introduction of this package.\nOver the course of the last few months, probably even longer, we have all felt a sense that Europe urgently needs to shift gears.\nIf anything, our experience in Davos but certainly also in Munich a couple of weeks ago have brought this into ever sharper focus.\nWe are all too aware that our slow economic growth, our dependencies and the fragmented market we still operate in are increasingly a problem, particularly against a backdrop of volatile geopolitics.\nBut we are not here to re-visit problems.\nWe are here to talk about what type of solutions Europe should put forward.\nIn fact, today we are going all out to protect, defend, and advance our economy.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal is a game-changer for Europe's economy.\nIt is a business plan to truly re-industrialise our European Union.\nIt will drive competitiveness, boost our strategic independence and accelerate climate action. Ideally, it brings all those three elements closer together.\nCrucially, it proves that Europe also offers the most reliable and stable environment for investment.\nTo be clear, there is no question of turning our backs on climate action.\nBut we know that at the same time we cannot do this without bringing business and industry much more closely on board.\nThat is why we are making a strong business case for investments in decarbonisation.\nThat is why we are drastically simplifying the regulatory environment – so that businesses can focus on what they do best: growing and innovating.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe focus of our Plan is on two types of players:\nOne is the classic energy-intensive industries. Think about steel, aluminium, cement and utilities.\nThey need urgent support to confront high energy costs, unfair global competition and a set of complex regulations, which are eroding their competitiveness basically across all the Union.\nAbandoning them is clearly not an option. Rather on the contrary, we should not just make sure they survive but they should strive on European soil.\nThat means together with the experts in these fields and the ones with the know-how to improve carbon emissions in their respective sectors we will work closely together to tackle these problems.\nThe second set of sectors is the new kids on the block. Think about clean tech companies on the verge of high growth, those rolling out charging infrastructure for EVs or pioneering new battery technologies. Particularly young new companies, highly dynamic, quick on their feet but also sometimes footloose and offers from other places might seem appealing to them.\nWe need to make sure that these companies stay and drive in the European Union and have the whole EU as their market, much more that it is the case today, with the right conditions that will be possible.\nFor the sake of time and clarity, let me also focus on a couple of actions that should change the game.\nFirst, we are pulling out all the stops to bring energy prices down. There is no magic. We will not be able to do all of that from one day to the other, but we will make sure we will deploy much more clean energy and increase electrification in the next couple of years.\nSome of these actions can and should more immediate.\nOn the tax front, we will be asking Member States to lower electricity taxes paid by energy intensive industries and get rid of extra fees that don't have anything to do with energy to make sure they help their companies.\nWe are also ensuring that the price is stable during a certain period for industrial players. Therefore, we will allow Member States to subsidize these industry players on an easier way by relaxing State aid rules.\nAnd we are going to tackle permitting bottlenecks by putting forward practical solutions for industries looking to switch towards cleaner energy.\nIn the longer run, we also need to drastically increase our investments in grids, renewables and storage capacity. That is the only way to make sure energy becomes more affordable, more independent and we create a competitive edge.\nSecond, we are mobilising every available resource and leveraging many different funding avenues to drive an unprecedented surge in this type of investments.\nWe will be building on the success of our Innovation Fund. In doing so, we are introducing a new bank for industrial decarbonisation, partly based on the Emissions Trading System.\nA Bank that if you add all up you could raise up to 100 billion in the next ten years.\nBut then if you leverage that, if you put private sector money next to that you could easily add up to €400 billion.\nWith this plan, we are aiming to decrease industrial emissions by up to 30%.\nIt gives a clear signal that we mean business. Putting serious money on the table using the EU ETS, which is many ways our strongest policy tool to reach our climate goals.\nThird, we are making life simpler to do business in Europe because complexity and red tape are serious obstacles to innovation and progress.\nI would talk about one example specifically given others will talk more extensively about cutting the red tape. That is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). In my view, there is an imperative add on to our ETS. It clearly is a force for good.\nBut we also have the opportunity to significantly simplify the design.\nOur goal is to help companies reduce their carbon footprint without putting them at a competitive disadvantage.\nIf you do the numbers you will find the following. If we were to exempt, which we will, around 90% of companies within the scope of CBAM reporting, we will still be able to ensure the capture of over 99% of emissions. There is a relatively easy way to make sure we have almost the same result but cutting a huge tail in terms of bureaucracy that we were putting in our companies.\nThis is a first crucial step in a broader CBAM review. Today we are talking about simplification. This year we will be talking about downstream projects, on scope and exports.\nWe will continue to look at how we can help companies to make sure they advance.\nFourth and finally – we are taking some key steps to boost demand for EU-made clean products.\nWe will introduce some new criteria to ensure that products used in energy-intensive industries are resilient and sustainable.\nWe will also update public procurement rules in 2026 to give preference to European suppliers in key sectors.\nWe will be moving to a system than it is about more than just the lower possible price. We will launch a voluntary carbon intensity label for industrial products, starting with steel in 2025, followed by cement.\nThis type of labels will inform consumers and allow manufacturers to reap a premium on their decarbonisation efforts.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nGiven the uncertainties and challenges we are facing globally, it is natural to feel like we could be standing at a crossroads.\nBut for Europe, the path ahead is clear.\nWe will re-industrialise our economy and we will do so in the European way. We will be investing in the technologies and energies that will power a cleaner, more competitive and self-sufficient future.\nWe have a plan.\nWe will be putting the plan into action, and we will be starting today.\n*Updated on 26 February 2025, at 17:40",

        "date": "Feb 6, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Thank you Chair,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nExcellent to have the opportunity to be here. Thank you for the invitation and your kind words on our collaboration which I'm very much looking forward to.\nLet's tackle my job title right away. I have the longest job title I've ever had but indeed there is one important element missing and that is taxation. So be aware that I always add it when I have the opportunity because of the importance and relevance of the topic.\nTaxes allow us to build better societies and to invest in the things that matter most: safety and security, quality education, roads and so on. So we must continue to focus on how we structure taxes in a way that advances our economies and first and foremost the well-being of our people.\nToday I'll mention a couple of things :\nFirst, on the competitiveness agenda;\nSecond and closely tied to competitiveness, the role of tax in supporting the green transition;\nAnd third, how we should work on fairness and transparency in taxation.\nFirst, on competitiveness.\nAs you know last week, we unveiled the Commission's new roadmap for the next five years called the Competitiveness Compass. It identifies what we need to do to boost competitiveness, clearly highlighting the need for a competitiveness-driven approach to decarbonisation. Decarbonisation not only as a climate strategy but also as a clean growth strategy.\nWe'll finalise the Clean Industrial Deal at the end of the month. Our goal is to present industry with a stronger business case for large climate neutral investments in energy intensive industries and clean tech.\nSo what does this mean for tax policy?\nWe'll look into recommendations on immediate expensing and accelerated depreciation to encourage business to invest in clean tech production. We'll also look into if and how we update the State Aid framework to ensure it's fit for purpose. And we'll continue to work on current legislative proposals such as BEFIT that will enhance EU competitiveness.\nWe're also very much aware that high energy prices are a major challenge for businesses large and small across our Union. To address this, we'll look into the role of levies, charges but also taxes.\nOn top of that, it's clear that complexity and red tape –created at European level but also to the same degree at Member States level – needs to be tackled. Therefore we're exploring in each and every domain what we can do, either ourselves as Commission or how we can incentivise Member States to do the same. For example we're looking into streamlining the Anti-Avoidance Directive and improving overall exchange of information for tax purposes. Specifically, we're examining ways to streamline the VAT reporting scheme for payment service providers, amongst other things. And we are also looking into simplifying CBAM.\nSecond, taxation can be a powerful and effective tool for driving progress on our climate goals.\nIn this respect, I hope to close negotiations on the Energy Taxation Directive, which if we manage to see this through, will further incentivise clean energy by taxing fossil fuels more than renewables. In my view, the text needs to be more ambitious in the aviation and maritime sectors and we do want to make sure we make progress on emission targets.\nI'm also keen to explore other ways of pushing forward our clean transition agenda like for instance, greening VAT systems.\nWe saw how the 2022 VAT reform was an important first step in this process, bringing tangible benefits such as cheaper solar panels and heat pumps.\nI'm interested in looking into further VAT reforms in key areas. These could include transport and tourism, the circular economy and not easy but very important the treatment of second-hand goods, the destruction of recyclable goods, and aviation and maritime.\nThird big angle: we must ensure that our tax systems are equitable, simple, and designed to prevent fraud.\nIt's of the utmost importance that these systems are fraud-proof when we build them.\nJust last month, we published the latest report on the VAT gap. One figure in the report really stood out to me. In 2022, the VAT tax gap stood at EUR 89 billion for the 27 EU Member States.\nYou could argue that the number has gone done and we have done a good job in the past few years. But it's such a huge amount for Member States who are almost without exception cash constrained. This is something we really need to look into it and we need to do more of.\nWe always talk about raising taxes, slashing spending or further increasing debt levels. Unfortunately the conversation is not often about how to boost productivity and how to close the tax gap. This is a missed opportunity in my view. How do we get the money we're actually entitled to get.\nThose are the main priorities.\nThere are a few more relevant points:\nOn E-commerce. I'm sure you saw yesterday's Communication. If you look at these numbers, they're truly staggering. We are getting more than 4 billion small parcels into the Union. It's double what we got last year. And last year was double what we got the year before. It's a huge workload. It means sorts of hazards in terms of safety and security  and we're being flooded with plastic and paper that we need to get rid of. We really need to draw a line in the sand here and I'm glad we took a further step in this direction yesterday.\nFinally on the international front, I'm sure it's on the mind of many of you.\nI very much look forward to engaging with OECD partners.\nOn the US executive order on the Global tax deal, of course, in my view, it's a regrettable development.\nThe US and the EU have always shared the same interest in curbing profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. It's in our common interest. We believe global tax problems require global solutions and remain committed to the obligations which we undertook in the OECD over the last years.\nI'll be looking for opportunities to engage constructively with the new US Administration on Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.\nLast but not least, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the hard work that the Chair, Mr. Tridico and the FISC coordinators have put into organising the Tax Symposium that takes place on 18 March.  If it's not yet in your calendar, please put it in there.\nThank you.",

        "date": "Jul 15, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Remarks by Executive Vice-President Timmermans\nThank you very much and happy to be here again.\nCommissioner Gentiloni will present our proposals on energy taxation and the, so called, CBAM, which is now a new word for Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nIf we want to put our society on a sustainable path, we need also to look at these two issues. They are of extreme importance to make sure that the changes are fair and the changes are in balance.\nWe can do a lot through European regulation, through European plans, such as the ETS. But also taxations, tax on all levels and that's why we will be looking at the revision of a rather ancient directive that urgently needs to be revised.\nWithout further ado, I would like to pass the floor to Commissioner Gentiloni.\nRemarks by Commissioner Gentiloni\nGood morning. With every passing year the terrible reality of climate change becomes more apparent and with it, the need for a bold and determined response. And the two proposals we are presenting here this morning are crucial parts of that response, crucial elements of the overall package we adopted yesterday.\nIt was high time that we overhauled the two-decades old Energy Taxation Directive. The minimum rates it lays down are at the same level as they were in 2003. They have never been adjusted for inflation. They do not reflect the actual energy content or environmental performance of the energy sources covered. They lead to pollutant fuels being taxed less than their cleaner alternatives, which of course makes no sense. In short, the current rules are completely out of synch with our green ambitions.\nFirst, the proposal stops harmful energy tax competition, with a new structure of minimum tax rates based on the energy content and environmental performance of the fuels and electricity.\nCompared to the current system where the minimum rates apply by volume, this will provide clearer price signals to businesses and consumers alike. It will help them to make cleaner, more climate-friendly choices and investments, encouraging a switch to renewable energy and cleaner alternative fuels.\nIt will also help reflect the ‘polluter pays' principle in our tax rules. While the Energy Taxation Directive sets out only minimum rates for various categories of products, Member States will need to ensure their ranking is reflected by taxing the most environmentally harmful fuels most.\nSecond, we are broadening the taxable base by including more products and uses that have entered the energy mix since 2003.\nAt the same time, a number of possibilities for exemptions and rate reductions allowed under the current rules will be removed, with margin for Member States to set rates below the minima only for specific “green” products such as electricity made from renewable energy.\nFinally, we are de facto bringing kerosene used as fuel in the aviation industry and oil used in waterborne transport into the scope of the Directive. It was fully exempted before. We are making them taxable for the first time, by removing their mandatory exemptions. This is a crucial measure - and it sends a crucial message - given the role of these sectors in energy consumption and pollution.\nTo support the use of more environmentally friendly products in these sectors, the consumption of sustainable and advanced products will not come under the scope of the rules for these sectors for ten years. So, the alternatives to kerosene and oil in air and maritime will not be taxed for ten years.\nThere is growing awareness among our population that we need adopt greener habits. But consumers may be justifiably worried that new energy tax rules mean higher fuel prices. Let me be clear. The switch to greener energy can only happen as part of a broader, socially fair, transition to a more sustainable economy. We need to balance fairness and ambition.\nFor example, Member States should adopt compensatory measures for the vulnerable and those affected by energy poverty, including through revenue redistribution.\nSo our proposal also contains in-built possibilities for Member States to relieve lower-income households from any additional tax burden while they adjust to greener energy over the coming years.\nLet me now turn to our proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism or CBAM. I think this is another demonstration of the potential leading role of the EU at global level. The rationale is to address the risk of carbon leakage which can undermine our efforts when production is moved elsewhere to avoid EU carbon pricing.\nMany EU businesses are already subject to the EU's extremely successful flagship Emissions Trading System. But as long as industrial installations outside the EU are not subject to similarly ambitious measures, these efforts can lose their effect.\nThat's why we need the new CBAM: an environmental policy tool that will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imported goods for certain sectors.\nThe CBAM has been designed to mirror the already existing Emissions Trading System, to ensure a fair and equal treatment for products made in the EU and imports from elsewhere, and to allow for a careful, predictable and proportionate transition for businesses and authorities.\nLike the Emissions Trading System, the CBAM will be based on certificates whose prices correspond to the embedded emissions in imported goods.\nIf it can be shown that a carbon price has been paid for the embedded emissions in those imported goods, that amount will be removed from the importer's bill.\nBy addressing carbon leakage in this way, companies elsewhere will be incentivised to ‘green' their production processes. And the CBAM will also encourage foreign governments to introduce greener policies for industry.\nFor the transitional period, which will last from 2023-2025, CBAM will apply to the iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity sectors. In this phase, importers will only have to report emissions embedded in their goods, without paying a financial adjustment. This will give time to prepare for the final system to be put in place.\nIt will enter into force in 2026, coinciding with the entry into force of the reinforced Emissions Trading System. Importers will need to buy certificates that can be offset against embedded emissions.  The cost of certificates will be based on weekly Emissions Trading System prices.\nFinally, a lot has been said and written over the last few months about the design of the CBAM.\nLet me say again that the CBAM is an environmental policy tool, not a tariff tool. It is in line and compliant with international trading rules. It will apply to products, not countries, based on their actual carbon content, independently of their country of origin.\nAnd it has been fully calibrated with the Emissions Trading System so that as free allowances are phased out under the ETS, CBAM is phased in for the sectors it covers.\nOf course there is a lot of attention, curiosity and concern about this decision at global level.\nLast weekend I was happy to update my counterparts at the G20 in Venice. I can report back that these plans are received overall positively there. There is great interest in how we can cooperate on carbon pricing measures globally. You know that this is under discussion in several countries, from Canada to the US. And we stand ready to discuss the CBAM in the context of the WTO and at the COP26.\nCooperation at global level and European ambition can and will go hand in hand. We are completely open to global cooperation and this is why we have introduced a transition period in introducing the CBAM. But at the same time we can't wait for a quite difficult global carbon pricing system to take place tomorrow because we know knowing our partners that these discussions will take years and years. And as it happens for other measures of the EU, I think that if we give an example of a mechanism, and if it works, and of course without any discriminatory impact, this will be helpful to reach full agreement.\nThe design we have chosen will gradually bring the CBAM into effect and this will allow the industrial sectors involved to have time to adapt and to provide maximum certainty for business.",

        "title": "Frans Timmermans speech at the European Hydrogen Week",
        "date": "Nov 30, 2021",
        "location": "no location found",
        "text": "My task is to help you through your after lunch depression today. I'm looking forward to doing that because, as many of you know, I am a great believer in the potential of hydrogen to help us decarbonise our economy. And to make sure that we maintain a path of growth and that we don't equate a transition into a society where we no longer depend on the element C as a society of poverty and decline. There is no need for that.\nWhen I left for Glasgow last month, I asked my team to give me contributions for a playlist I made on Spotify of songs that make us think about climate and a better world. You can look it up onSpotifyif you want. It has been listened to, it has quite some interesting music if you're into music.\nOf course there are so many more songs that could have been added. With this hydrogen week, I think about the Brussels duo “Hydrogen Sea”, and maybe you should invite them next year for the hydrogen week. They are committed young people and their songs like “cold water” and “If the stars grow dim tonight” urge us to take action and to turn the tide on the climate crisis.\nI am deeply convinced that hydrogen will help us complete that transition in a positive way.\nHere today, at the start of your afternoon program which focuses on the global dimension, I would like to say a few words about the international dimension of climate policy and hydrogen in particular. I want to share with you my dream and my ambition for a global hydrogen economy.\nWith the Glasgow COP just behind us, we have for the very fist time a shot at staying below two degrees Celsius of global warming. We have a shot at the 1.5 degree goal.\nTwo years ago it was a lonely position to be in Madrid as European Union. The US had as a leader somebody who just denied the climate crisis. China didn't want to do anything. But look at where we are now. They're all declaring carbon neutral, climate neutral goals. Even Russia has done that. Russia is even introducing the first pricing of carbon, which would have been completely unthinkable less than a year ago.\nThis COP embraced the highest level of ambition of the Paris Agreements as our common target. As I said, we now have a global consensus on the need to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Two weeks after COP26 this almost seems like a given but two weeks before we began, the mantra was still below two degrees, and some countries even challenged the fact that Paris ever spoke of 1.5 degrees.\nFor the first time as well, the parties of COP26 agreed to phase down coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Whatever you may think about the precise language that was necessary to get the whole package over the finishing line, this is a big win. The signal is clear: the era of coal is ending! And interestingly enough, this has also been stimulated by the fact that our ETS system is creating higher and higher prices which makes coal ever more unattractive.\nAnd Glasgow has given a great push to the hydrogen agenda. President von der Leyen mentioned this morning already the new EU-catalyst partnership with Bill Gates that we launched with the EIB and that will mobilise up to $1 billion up to 2026 to rapidly commercialise innovative technologies with a focus on clean hydrogen.\nI want to give you another example: together with France, Germany, the UK and the United States we also announced in Glasgow the set-up of aJust Energy Transition Partnershipwith South Africa. We will accelerate the decarbonisation of South Africa's economy with a prominent role for hydrogen. Can you imagine that, in that so coal-dependent country things can move so fast. The initial commitment of $8.5 billion for the first phase will help South Africa achieve its ambitious goals. This is the kind of partnership I believe that should inspire us to do similar partnerships with other third countries. It is only a start. Countries like Indonesia and India are interested to look for similar kinds of cooperation.\nOf course of particular interest to the EU is cooperation with our sister continent Africa. It will be key, including with North Africa; with its geographic proximity, its existing infrastructure, solar energy resources and its average of 3.600 hours of sunshine yearly, the windy Sahara desert and hydropower, it offers green hydrogen opportunities which we should seize strategically. A dedicated call to cooperate with Africa is included in the 2021 – 2022 Work Programme of the new Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, funded by Horizon Europe.\nBesides Africa, other neighbours and Latin-America are excellent candidates for further assistance and we see indeed the rising interest of many of our partners to work with us on hydrogen and develop hydrogen valleys. I am happy to see also the energy minister of Chile as a guest speaker today .\nWhile the dynamics are there, we still need to do a lot. Global trade in hydrogen does actually not exist today. Clean Green Hydrogen is still far too expensive everywhere, so technology cost reductions and scale-up are urgently necessary .\nA global rules-based market for hydrogen, in particular renewable hydrogen, needs to develop with at the heart of that market, harmonised safety and environmental standards as well as a clear rules and suitable infrastructure.\nI want the EU to take the clear lead in establishing such a framework for a global hydrogen economy. We are ready to work with all partner countries to establish the right conditions for the emergence of a global market for a secure and competitive renewable hydrogen supply.\nI know the debate between those who are more hesitant about hydrogen imports and those who are more open to it, but our hydrogen strategy of last year foresees both, it aims for “two times 40 GW” for 2030. . 40GW of renewable electrolysers in Europe and 40GW in Europe's neighbourhood with export to the EU. When we launched thisless than two years ago, it was seen as a pipe dream, it was seen as impossible.  I think now it is realistic to say we will probably outperform it by 2030.\nI think it is important that we engage internationally in renewable hydrogen because I think it will profit Europe in three different ways:\nWhen we went to Glasgow, the international press described Europe as “the best prepared pupil of the class”. That, ladies and gentlemen, is I believe our strength: with the European Green Deal and the “Fit for 55” proposals we have our own house in order and we can set the tone, influence others and take them along. I want to especially mention the Climate Law which sets into law the need to reduce our emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to be climate neutral by 2050.\nIt is also clear that on our own we will never get there. But , as we speak, our example is being followed. China is introducing an emissions trading system based on our emissions trading system. Other major economies know they will have to put a price on carbon. They are all looking at systems such as CBAM and comparable systems to avoid the risk of carbon leakage.\nThe same path should be followed for hydrogen. We are busy getting our house in order by defining a European framework for the uptake of a European hydrogen-market.\nOur ‘Fit for 55' package is a first step to implement our EU Hydrogen Strategy and to provide the right regulatory framework and support to create a hydrogen ecosystem with more renewable power to produce hydrogen, more hydrogen production facilities, and the necessary infrastructure to transport and deliver hydrogen to end-consumers everywhere around Europe.\nOur long-term priority is to produce renewable hydrogen, using mainly wind or solar energy. It is the missing part of the puzzle to a fully decarbonised economy. In the short term we will still need to rely on low-carbon hydrogen as well.\nEspecially if you see the speed with which we want to do the energy transition. I only have to refer to the plans of the new incoming German government where you see that if you step out of coal faster, you continue to step out of nuclear, you will have to compensate for that. And wen gas will be part of that,  of course decarbonated hydrogen can also be, will also be, part of that.\nOur Fit for 55 priorities include for instance certification for renewable hydrogen, additional renewables, sufficient hydrogen refuelling stations, CO2 reduction targets for ships arriving at European ports, support through the new taxation proposals and tightening of the European Emissions Trading Scheme.\nIn some areas we really see changes. Who would have thought in shipping such a change so quickly. A year ago it still looked hopeless and now they're speeding up. And I'm absolutely sure that hydrogen, but especially also ammonia, will play a huge role in fueling ships of the future. I'm glad to see the shipping industry is coming to that analysis itself.\nNext month, with the upcoming hydrogen and gas markets decarbonisation package, we will conclude our work and put forward a European regulatory framework allowing the emergence of a fully-fledged hydrogen market with a dedicated infrastructure.\nTogether with the new state aid rules, it will have the potential to produce and trade renewables and low-carbon hydrogen across the EU. This should then put us in a very good position to provide global leadership in developing an international hydrogen market with clear rules for international trading of clean hydrogen, especially certifying green transport and distribution means.\nThis is feasible, this is within reach. And let's not forget, the stars are made of hydrogen, so let's reach for the stars. Or as I used to say, hydrogen rocks.\nLet me conclude that I am proud that the EU is a world leader in hydrogen technologies. This offers many opportunities, for our planet and for our people, in terms of jobs and in terms of the wellbeing of all in a safer, healthier and climate neutral world.\nBut, let us stay sharp and let us act swiftly and with foresight in view of the emerging international hydrogen markets.\nLet's not forget the painful experience in solar PV manufacturing, which was developed in Europe at high cost only to later move abroad. Let's not take any chances with hydrogen. Let's be open but competitive, let's be ambitious but not naïve. Let's reach out, be proactive and daring, the time is right for Europe to tap into the potential of hydrogen in a clean, secure and affordable energy future for all.\nIt will change the map of our energy world because you will see energy producers that have no natural resources other than sun and wind become energy producers for a global market. And I want that global market to function. Because some, who might air on the more pessimistic side, will say that Europe cannot afford to make itself dependable on production from outside of Europe. Others, and I belong to that group, say we need global interdependency for our stability, and especially for the enormous potential of our sister continent Africa hydrogen is an incredible opportunity.\nI believe, especially together with Africa and the Middle East, that Europe should use those opportunities and should create patterns of cooperation that will benefit all sides. Thank you very much.",

        "title": "EU-Canada Summit 2023 - Joint Statement",
        "date": "Nov 24, 2023",
        "location": "St. John's",
        "text": "I. Building a more prosperous, secure, and sustainable future\n1. We, the leaders of Canada and the European Union (EU), met today in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador to reaffirm our strategic partnership, advance our cooperation to seize the opportunities of our time and respond to pressing challenges. In a more complex, competitive and unpredictable world, working together to promote our shared values of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the rules based international order and to pursue our common interests is more important than ever. We stand firmly together in the pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity in the world including in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n2. Our steadily deepening partnership makes us stronger and more resilient, delivering clear benefits to our people by generating sustainable economic growth and creating jobs. Cooperation between Canada and the EU can help make life more affordable and create good jobs – on both sides of the Atlantic. Our common values and principles are why we are positioned to grow circular, nature positive and climate-neutral economies across Canada and Europe that are competitive, inclusive and provide equal opportunities for all, and why we are able to work together to fight the triple crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to protect people from its worst impacts. We are putting people first as we do this – making sure households are better off as we build a prosperous climate neutral economy.\n3. We emphasize the fundamental role that the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) and the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) have played in strengthening our relationship in the seven years since they were signed, remain strongly committed to ensuring their full and effective implementation and their ratification, and commit to further expanding our cooperation under these agreements.\n4. Today we are pleased to announce significant new areas of cooperation. The establishment of a Green Alliance will deepen our already close cooperation on climate action and shared work to grow sustainable, competitive economies with good jobs. A Digital Partnership will strengthen our engagement on digital transformation and governance in a rapidly changing world. Substantive negotiations of an agreement on Canada's participation in the EU's Horizon Europe programme are now completed and both sides are working towards its prompt signature and implementation. The agreement will further strengthen the cooperation of our science communities in addressing global challenges.\nII. Global Priorities\n5. Our support to Ukraine is steadfast. We share an unequivocal condemnation of Russia's ongoing war of aggression and our unwavering commitment to Ukraine including a just and sustainable peace based on international law, Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. We will continue our intensified diplomatic outreach efforts and cooperation with Ukraine and other countries to ensure the widest possible international support for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace and the key principles and objectives of Ukraine's Peace Formula, with a view to a Global Peace Summit being held. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, will work to address Ukraine's immediate military and defence needs and ensure Ukraine has the long-term security commitments needed, while it pursues its Euro-Atlantic integration. We will do so in full respect of the security and defence policy of certain EU Member States and taking into account the security and defence interests of all EU Member States, the EU and Canada.  We will work together to support Ukraine's sustainable security, will continue providing military, humanitarian, economic and financial support, and facilitate trade, private investment, and will prioritize recovery and reconstruction. We welcome the informal coordination between Canada and the EU's training missions, Operations UNIFIER and EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), conducting critical training of the Ukrainian military. Canada and the EU alongside other G7 Members, will continue to work through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform on ensuring a robust response to Ukraine's reconstruction needs. To further strengthen this collaboration, Canada intends to deploy a secondee to the Platform's Secretariat in the near future. We acknowledge Ukraine's commitment and substantial efforts to meet the required conditions in its EU accession process. We encourage Ukraine to continue on its path of reforms. We will continue to work together to support Ukraine's security, defence and resilience on one hand, and reconstruction and reforms on the other, thus creating conditions to mobilise private investment. The EU and Canada will continue cooperating to deliver concrete solutions in support of Ukraine's agriculture and agri-food sector which could include facilitating exports of grain and agricultural products from Ukraine to third countries including those most in need. We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and in reform efforts on its European path.\n6. Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine. We are united in our determination to ensure full accountability. The EU and Canada call for work to continue, including in the Core Group, on efforts to establish a tribunal for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine that would enjoy the broadest cross-regional support and legitimacy, and towards the establishment of a future compensation mechanism. Canada and the EU recognise that decisive progress is needed, in coordination with partners, on how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction, consistent with applicable contractual obligations, and in accordance with EU and international law.\n7. We recognize the value and the growing importance of our cooperation on restrictive measures. In particular, we will continue to impose extensive sanctions targeting Russia, as well as stringent export control restrictions and prohibitions. Moreover, we are committed to further strengthening our cooperation and coordination on broader sanctions actions, including disrupting circumvention, in support of our policy objectives.\n8.We unequivocally condemn Hamas for its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel on October 7. We support Israel's right to defend itself, in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and welcome the recent agreement to liberate hostages and to allow for an extended humanitarian pause to permit the delivery of essential supplies. We underscore that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations.\n9. We are gravely concerned about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and welcome the adoption of resolution 2712 by the United Nations (UN) Security Council, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip.  We reaffirm the imperative to protect civilians and ensure full compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law. We strongly reiterate the importance of urgent and unimpeded access for life saving humanitarian aid flowing to Gaza through all necessary measures, including humanitarian corridors and pauses. We have contributed significant funding for humanitarian assistance and remain committed to addressing urgent humanitarian needs.\n10. We remain committed to the goal of comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East, and re-iterate our belief in the renewed importance of progress towards a two-state solution on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions through reinvigorated efforts in the peace process. We stand ready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the two-state solution, with the State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous, sovereign, and viable Palestinian State, living side-by-side in peace and security and mutual recognition. We remain opposed to any forced displacement of Palestinians. We condemn all forms of intolerance and discrimination, on the basis of religion, belief or origin and remain firmly committed to combatting all forms of hatred.\n11. We express deep concerns with Iran's nuclear escalation and its refusal to meaningfully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and its persistent failure to implement JCPOA commitments. We wholly support the IAEA's mission of continued verification and monitoring in Iran. A diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue remains the best way to address international concerns. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon.\n12. We are prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, including through cooperation on global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, debt sustainability, global health and pandemic preparedness. China is an important trade and economic partner and we will seek to ensure a level playing field and a balanced, reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship. We will continue to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in its supply chains, and will de-risk and diversify where necessary and appropriate. We do not intend to decouple or to turn inwards. The East and South China Seas are of strategic importance for regional and global prosperity and security. We remain seriously concerned about growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in Canada's or the EU's One China policy. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang. With respect to Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.\n13. We recognize the critical challenges faced by our countries and by our global partners, from climate impacts and food insecurity to ensuring a just transition, good governance, rule of law, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will work together with partners from around the world to address these challenges, including in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. In the Pacific Islands, we will reinforce our support, including to advance their priorities in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms. We agree on the importance of a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic.\n14. We reaffirm our commitment to coordinate our actions in the Sahel region, alongside international and regional organizations. We support L‘Académie Internationale de Lutte Contre le Terrorisme in Côte d'Ivoire in responding to evolving terrorist threats and violent extremism. We will work together in supporting the people of Haiti in their efforts to build a more resilient and equitable future, including by fighting impunity and corruption, restoring security and stability and creating the necessary conditions for holding democratic elections.\nIII. Sustainable economic growth for all\n15.The Canada-EU economic relationship, underpinned by CETA, has contributed to delivering prosperity for our economies during a period of global uncertainty. Now in the seventh year of provisional application, CETA's benefits to workers, exporters and our economies are clear: in 2022, bilateral trade in goods was significantly higher to pre-CETA levels in 2016. Through a single set of high standard rules, businesses and workers in Canada and the EU are benefitting from a more predictable, transparent and accessible business environment. Canada and the EU will continue to use the mechanisms established by CETA to cooperate towards building resilient and diversified supply chains. We will continue work to ensure the full implementation of CETA, and to sustainably strengthen Canada-EU trade, including for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs. Canada and the EU acknowledge the important role CETA can play in driving sustainable development and moving towards a climate neutral economy. We welcome related investments and will work together for transparency and against zero-sum competition in our path toward climate neutrality.\n16. Canada and the EU intend to focus on the negotiations toward a renewed competition cooperation agreement that would drive deeper cooperation and coordination possibilities between our respective competition agencies, providing a legal framework to coordinate enforcement activities and share information obtained through investigative powers in full respect of data privacy guarantees.\n17. Canada is well-positioned to contribute to Europe's energy security and energy transition. The Canada-EU High Level Energy Dialogue will continue facilitating action on all energy-related matters, including proceeding with the EU becoming a member of the Equal by 30 Campaign, led by Canada, which is working towards equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women in the energy sector by 2030 and launching a new European Commission – Canada Roadmap on Methane Emissions. We are laying the foundation for reliable hydrogen supply chains and common approaches to standards and certification, which will accelerate commercialization and increase transatlantic trade.\n18. To secure reliable and sustainable supply chains and competitive economic growth, Canada and the EU continue to advance shared work on critical minerals, including through the Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials. Critical minerals are essential for the transition towards climate-neutrality of our economies, and we will continue to support integrated, secure and diversified supply chain development, science, technology and innovation cooperation, and enhance global environmental, social and governance criteria and standards. This will include joint efforts to engage and connect our respective businesses to accelerate two-way trade and investment that can help develop new supply sources for critical minerals. Canada and the EU agree that secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials enabling the green and digital transition is emerging as a shared challenge for the global community and will continue discussing how participation in the EU-proposed Critical Raw Materials Club would complement and strengthen ongoing initiatives to jointly address that challenge.\n19. Economic security is a growing concern for governments around the world, and cooperation with partners and engagement with stakeholders will assist with better policy-making. To support this, Canada and the EU will launch a Canada-EU dialogue on economic security to exchange information on trends and risks of mutual concern which could affect our economic security and developments with regards to possible policy responses.\nIV. Combatting climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution\n20. With today's establishment of a Canada-EU Green Alliance, Canada and the EU continue to deepen our partnership on fighting climate change, protecting the environment and ocean, halting and reversing biodiversity loss and growing a strong, prosperous future. Recognising the key role of both Canada and the EU in leading global efforts to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to foster a circular nature-positive and global climate neutral economy by 2050, the Alliance is a testament to the depth and breadth of our shared ambition. Building on our extensive existing cooperation, the Alliance aims to take our partnership to the next level by further intensifying our political, technical, economic and scientific cooperation on climate action, environmental and ocean protection, energy transition, green industrial transformation, regulatory and business cooperation, research and innovation, climate finance, sustainable finance and biodiversity finance and cooperation at the multilateral level and supporting the climate-neutral transitions of third countries.\n21. Recent natural disasters and extreme weather events have devastated communities in Canada and Europe alike. Canada is grateful for the support provided through the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism during the most significant forest fire season on record in Canada. We welcome the signature of an administrative arrangement to improve the sharing of information and best practices on how to respond to emergencies.Canada is pleased to facilitate the export of Canadian-built fire-fighting aircraft to bolster the EU's and Member States' fleets.\n22. We recognize that even more ambitious action is required to mitigate and build resilience to climate change, underpinned by an unwavering commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and ensuring a credible path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the upcoming 28thConference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), we will work together to promote decisive global action to tackle the climate crisis and to set the direction for future global climate efforts on the basis of the Global Stock Take recommendations. We will work together to accelerate the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels no later than 2050 and end the construction of new coal-fired power generation in a manner consistent with the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Recognizing the importance of increasing energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy, we will work towards the full and effective implementation of the Global Energy Pledge to collectively double the rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030 and to triple the world's installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 to 11 Terawatts, while respecting each country's national energy mix. We will also work to support the most vulnerable countries, including by delivering on climate finance commitments, calling on contributors to raise their ambition, and establishing funding arrangements on loss and damage. We will continue to convene the Ministerial on Climate Action with China, and will continue to lead global action on short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, under the Global Methane Pledge, the Global Methane Initiative, the International Methane Emissions Observatory and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.\n23. We will lead the way to mobilise partners around the world for the signature, ratification and effective implementation of the High Seas Treaty and for the swift and full implementation of the historic Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF), agreed to in Montreal. To this end, we will work together to develop ambitious nature-positive policies, mainstreaming biodiversity into all sectors. We share the objective to prevent global deforestation, and we intend to work together and with others to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, including as they relate to global supply chains, while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation. We will also cooperate towards substantially and progressively increasing the mobilisation of financial resources to support international biodiversity objectives, in line with the goals and the targets of the KMGBF.\n24.We recognize that carbon pricing is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to spur related investment and   innovation in the interest of the people's health and well-being. In that regard, Canada and the EU reaffirm their support for the Call to Action for Paris Aligned Carbon Markets, launched at the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact. Canada welcomes the EU as the most recent Partner to join the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge to expand the use of carbon pricing globally by strengthening existing systems and supporting emerging ones. Canada and the EU commit to continue exchanges on their carbon pricing systems and working closely on measures to address carbon leakage risks in a non-discriminatory manner including on next steps for cooperation on the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We will also address emissions intensity of the steel and aluminium manufacturing industries and advance manufacturing, re-manufacturing and recycling of steel and aluminium, both at home and abroad, and will continue cooperating closely in bilateral and multilateral fora.\n25. We are committed to ending plastic pollution by 2040 and will work together, including through the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee and High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, to develop a dedicated ambitious and effective international legally binding instrument.\n26. Through the Canada-EU Ocean Partnership, we are increasing cooperation on ocean governance, conservation, science, and sustainable use. In this context, we welcome the first Ocean Partnership Forum that took place in October 2022, and look forward to the next Forum planned for 2025. We will work together to achieve an ambitious Our Ocean Conference in Greece in 2024 and UN Ocean Conference in Nice in 2025.\nV. Research and innovation cooperation and responsible digital innovation\n27. We reaffirm our support for collaborative partnerships between our science research communities. Today, we are pleased to announce the completion of substantive negotiations on Canada's association to Pillar II of Horizon Europe, which once signed and implemented will provide new opportunities for international science partnerships on global challenges.\n28. As strategic partners in emerging technologies and cutting-edge research, we will contribute solutions to global challenges and provide new economic opportunities. We are launching the Canada-EU Digital Partnership, which will allow us to deepen our engagement on areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), online platform governance and accountability, and quantum technologies, secure international connectivity and cyber security, digital skills and digital credentials and digital identities.\n29. Canada and the EU share an interest in fostering safer, more inclusive digital environments. To this end, the Canada-EU Digital Partnership will be an important forum to collaborate on efforts to advance the accountability of online platforms such as social media and online marketplaces – in a way that enhances the respect for all human rights online. We are committed to holding online platforms accountable to mitigate the negative effects of content on their services on systemic societal risks, including gender-based violence, notably by giving their users tools and resources to protect themselves, and by mandating significantly more transparency for our societies over online content moderation.\n30.Canada and the EU have a longstanding collaboration in advancing responsible design, development and use of AI, including through key multilateral forums like the G7, through the Hiroshima AI Process, and the Global Partnership on AI, where both are founding members. Canada and the EU are also among the most advanced jurisdictions in the world regarding the regulation of AI technologies. We are committed to working together on the global governance of digital and other emerging technologies, like AI, rooted in a risk-based approach, the protection of safety and respect for human rights and the rules-based international order, supported by appropriate accountability mechanisms. In support of this, we will collaborate to ensure applicable regulatory measures. As we continue our respective work on AI governance and regulatory frameworks, we commit to work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to share information and strive for solutions to facilitate the interoperability of our domestic approaches, helping to ensure AI actors in Canada and Europe have the greatest possible access to international markets to advance the safe, secure and trustworthy commercialization of this technology.\n31. We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. To this end, we will cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards levels to protect consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyber incidents. We will also strengthen collaboration in upholding international norms of responsible state behaviour in cyber space, notably through the UN with the establishment of aProgram of Action for cybersecurity and joint diplomatic responses to counter malicious behaviour. We will also seek opportunities to enhance cooperation and coordination on cyber capacity building efforts and exchange information on regulatory measures.\n32. Further to the G7 Action Plan for Building a Secure and Resilient Digital Infrastructure, Canada and the EU intend to support secure international connectivity and explore possible new routes of international communication infrastructure to strengthen network resilience.\n33. We recognize the transformative role of digital technologies in enhancing economic growth and sustainability, and the need to ensure that they respect human rights and democracy. We aim to ensure Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) in compliance with relevant rules in the respective jurisdictions, including data protection rules.We also welcome the EU – Canada close cooperation on the EU's adequacy decision to ensure its continuity.\nVI. Advancing international peace and security\n34. We welcome increased Canada-EU cooperation on security and defence, including the upcoming administrative arrangement which confirms Canada's participation in the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation Project on network oflogistics hubs. We will seek to further deepen our cooperation through enhancing our security and defence dialogue, identifying opportunities for joint naval activities and strengthened collaboration on cyber security and the climate–security nexus. We reaffirm the importance of further strengthening and deepening the mutually reinforcing and beneficial EU-NATO partnership, while fully respecting the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity, transparency and decision-making autonomy. We will advance the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and meaningful participation of women and youth in prevention, mediation and resolution, in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.\n35. In support of our joint efforts in combatting terrorism and serious transnational crime, we welcome the finalisation of the negotiations that pave the way for the conclusion of a new Canada-EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data Agreement. This Agreement will provide a solid basis for the transfer and use of PNR data and ensure the capacity to effectively and efficiently prevent and fight terrorism and serious transnational crime while upholding privacy protections and protecting human rights.\nVII. Promoting Shared Values andthe Rules-Based International Order\n36. Democracy, human rights, gender equality and the rule of law remain universal principles that guide international action for both Canada and the EU. We are concerned with the ongoing backlash against gender equality and the rights of women, girls and LGBTI persons, including increased incidents of gender-based violence, including gender-based violence that is amplified by the use of technology. We will continue to call for respect for the rights of all women and girls, not only in Afghanistan and Iran, but around the world. We reaffirm our commitment to take concerted and collective action against arbitrary detention and to work closely to anchor its principles in the international legal and normative framework as well as to promote the biennial UN General Assembly Resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty. In 2023, Canadian observers have participated in EU election observation missions in Guatemala, Liberia, Maldives, Paraguay, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, and Canada will continue to work alongside the EU in electoral observation and the support of democratic principles and values.\n37. We will continue to strengthen our collaboration to counter foreign threats to democracy, including through platforms like the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. We will continue to work together to protect information integrity – grounded in inclusion, human rights and the rule of law – with the objective of defending against and increasing citizen and societal resilience to information manipulation and disinformation both online and offline, including through working on the development of international norms and principles, such as those in the Global Declaration on Information Integrity Online. We call on all foreign actors to cease and to refrain from interference activities, aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and processes and our economic prosperity. We will continue to work together on digital justice, and, in this context, welcome the first EU-Canada informal senior-level dialogue on justice issues, held in May 2022.\n38. The EU and Canada will make resolute efforts to uphold the rules-based international order with the UN at its core. We will strive for a well-functioning, reformed multilateral system, with an effective and sustainably funded UN. We will endeavour to work towards an effective, inclusive and networked multilateral system that is capable of facing new global realities and remain true to the rules and principles of the UN Charter. We are committed to working together with all partners to reinforce and reform global governance in line with ‘Our Common Agenda'. We are determined to seize the opportunities represented by the 2024 Summit of the Future and the 2025 World Social Summit to develop a system that is resilient and as relevant today as when it was created.\n39. We are committed to cooperate to reform the WTO so that it is better equipped to tackle modern day imperatives. We will work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024, including with respect to having a fully and well functioning dispute settlement system.\n40. Canada and the EU agree to explore the possibility of establishing a new dialogue on humanitarian issues under the SPA. We will work to address priorities of the global community, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – both at home and abroad, including mobilising finances to close the SDG financing gap. In particular, we will also focus on delivering better, bigger and more effective Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximize development impact. We will also sustain our support to the necessary reforms to the multilateral system and its development banks, and financing for global public goods such as climate, biodiversity or pandemic prevention, while preserving the focus on poverty eradication and shared prosperity, in line with the SDGs. We will also seek to prevent fragmentation through the transformation of the governance of the international financial architecture to make it more effective, transparent and accountable. We will contribute to strengthening global health security to better prevent, prepare and respond to current and future health emergencies, including by jointly promoting shared priorities for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of an effective, ambitious and legally binding new pandemic agreement, and the targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations, by May 2024. We also support the Pandemic Fund. We welcome plans for the first Canada-EU Health Policy Dialogue under the SPA, scheduled for early 2024. Global hunger has been rising since 2015 and has been intensified by rising food and energy insecurity. We stand ready to continue contributing to the global fertilizers production and value chains in order to ensure food security, decreasing dependency on Russian and Belarusian production.\n41. We have also agreed to deepen our partnership in support of high-quality global infrastructure development, in line with the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment and EU Global Gateway initiative's common objectives.\n42. We recognize the importance of sustainable, resilient and quality infrastructure throughout the world. We are committed to working together towards the joint G7 aim of mobilizing $600 billion in financing through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the EU Global Gateway initiative. Under these initiatives, we welcome our collaboration in support of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships with South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal, including under the Great Green Wall initiative. We will continue our close cooperation on the Kiwa Initiative, a multi-donor program that aims to strengthen climate change resilience in the Pacific Islands through nature-based solutions. FinDev Canada will continue to partner with EU-based development finance institutions to advance sustainable infrastructure solutions in support of positive development, climate and nature outcomes.\nVIII. Conclusion\n43. Canada and the EU are committed to addressing today's global challenges, including economic uncertainty, climate change, biodiversity loss, digital transformation, natural disasters and regional instabilities. Canada and the EU will be guided by our common commitment to democratic values, the rule of law, human rights, sustainability and an inclusive, multilateral, and rules-based international system. We will continue to work together in safeguarding our shared values, addressing common challenges, embracing the new opportunities of a rapidly changing world and strengthening the dynamic EU-Canada people-to-people contacts.",

        "date": "Dec 13, 2022",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The Commission welcomes the political agreement reached this morning between the European Parliament and the Council on theCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM is the EU's landmark toolto put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon intensive goods that are entering the EU, and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries. Today's agreement will be complemented by the revision of the Emissions Trading System (ETS), with negotiations taking place later this week, and that will align the phase-out of the allocation of free allowances with the introduction of CBAM to support the decarbonisation of EU industry.\nClimate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. As the EU raises its own climate ambition, and as long as less stringent climate policies prevail in many non-EU countries, there is a risk of so-called ‘carbon leakage'. Carbon leakage occurs when companies based in the EU move carbon-intensive production abroad to countries where less stringent climate policies are in place than in the EU, or when EU products get replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.\nBy making sure that a price is paid for the embedded carbon emissions generated in the production of certain goods imported into the EU, the CBAM will make sure the carbon price of imports is equivalent to the carbon price of domestic production, thereby ensuring that the EU's climate objectives are not undermined. The CBAM is designed in such a way that it is compatible with WTO-rules.\nPresidentvon der Leyensaid: “I welcome the political agreement reached this morning on the Commission's proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This is a central part of our European Green Deal, preventing the risk of carbon leakage. It is a huge step forward, as we raise our climate ambitions.”\nKey elements\nThe CBAM willinitially apply to imports of certain goods and selected precursorswhose production is carbon intensive and at most significant risk of carbon leakage: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen. With this enlarged scope, CBAM will eventually – when fully phased in – capture more than 50% the emissions of the ETS covered sectors. Under this political agreement, the CBAM willenter into force in its transitional phase as of 1 October 2023.\nThe gradual phasing in of CBAM over time will allow for acareful, predictable and proportionate transition for EU and non-EU businesses, as well as for public authorities. During this period, importers of goods in the scope of the new rules will only have to report greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) embedded in their imports (direct emissions), without making any financial payments or adjustments. The agreement foresees that indirect emissions will be covered in the scope after the transitional period, on the basis of a methodology to be defined in the meantime.\nOnce the permanent system enters into force, according to a schedule to be defined in the revised EU ETS rules currently under negotiation, importers will need to declare each year the quantity of goods imported into the EU in the preceding year and their embedded GHG. They will then surrender the corresponding number of CBAM certificates. The price of the certificates will be calculated depending on the weekly average auction price of EU ETS allowances expressed in €/tonne of CO2 emitted.\nA review of the CBAM's functioning during its transitional phase will be concluded before the entry into force of the definitive system. At the same time, the product scope will be reviewed to assess the feasibility of including other goods produced in sectors covered by the EU ETS in the scope of the CBAM mechanism, such as certain downstream products and those identified as suitable candidates during negotiations. The report will include a timetable setting out their inclusion by 2030.\nNext steps\nGiven the close links between the new CBAM and the review of the EU ETS, currently under negotiation in ‘trilogue' between the co-legislators, the final technical details of the mechanism's functioning will need to be clarified. Once the text has been finalised, the European Parliament and the Council will have to formally adopt the new Regulation before it can enter into force.",

        "title": "Questions and Answers: Commission proposes to reinforce long-term EU budget to face most urgent challenges",
        "date": "Jun 20, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "MAIN ELEMENTS\nWhat are the main conclusions of the review?\nThe review has drawn several conclusions:\nIn short, a targeted revision of the MFF is necessary to equip the MFF with the means to ensure that the EU can meet its legal obligations and address the most urgent priorities.\nHow much more money are you proposing? For which programmes?\nThe proposal covers a targeted set of political priorities and necessary technical adjustments to the 2021-2027 budget to ensure that it can deliver until the end of the period.\nMore concretely:\nDoes this mean additional financing by EU Member States?\nThe MFF was decided back in 2020, since then, the world has drastically changed. The economic and social effects from Russia's war are tremendous, with impacts, among others, on energy costs, consumer prices, interest rates, supply chain disruptions. These effects are felt in Ukraine, in the Union as well as in the rest of the world including our close neighbours.\nWhile the multiannual nature of the EU budget provides stability and predictability, it has limited capacity to respond to major unexpected events, and its flexibilities are being depleted as extensive use of redeployments and reprogramming, on top of existing budgetary flexibilities, has been necessary to address the unforeseen challenges. Faced with this situation, the Commission sees no alternative to ensure that the EU can deliver on all its objectives, especially the most urgent ones, until the end of 2027, than to propose a targeted revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021 – 2027.\nHow is the Commission proposing to support Ukraine?\nThe Commission is proposing the creation of an integrated and flexible instrument, the Ukraine Facility, with an overall capacity of €50 billion over 2024-2027. The amounts will be defined on an annual basis depending on Ukraine's evolving needs and implementation capacities.\nUnderpinned by a Ukraine Plan to be presented by the Government of Ukraine, the Ukraine Facility will support Ukraine's efforts to sustain macro-financial stability, promote recovery as well as modernise the country whilst implementing key reforms on its EU accession track.\nThe financing will be provided in the form of loans and non-repayable support (‘grants' and guarantees), with the actual distribution being determined annually. Thanks to this construction the instrument will provide certainty for a multiannual commitment and flexibility to adjust annually to evolving needs on the ground.\nThis translates into stable and predictable funding under a framework that ensures the protection of the EU budget and the sustainability of the Union's and Ukraine's finances.\nThe loan support will be financed by borrowing on the financial markets and guarantees through the headroom of the EU budget. The headroom is the difference between the own resources ceiling (i.e. the maximum amount of resources that the Commission can ask Member States to contribute in a given year) and the funds that the Commission actually needs to cover the expenses foreseen by the budget. The non-repayable support will be financed through the EU annual budget under a new special instrument, the Ukraine Reserve, with resources over and above the MFF expenditure ceilings.\nWhat are the key principles of the financial architecture for support to Ukraine?\nA dedicated maximum amount for 2024-2027will be established for both loans and non-repayable support in form of grants and guarantees.\nThe level of support would be calibrated annually, including the share of loans and grants. The instrument gives balance between flexibility and predictability according to the evolving needs on the ground given war developments, Ukraine implementation, absorption and debt capacity.\nHow is the Commission proposing to reinforce competitiveness?\nThe Commission proposes the creation of STEP to support the EU's industrial competitiveness through investments in the development and manufacturing of critical forward-looking technologies in the fields of digital and deep tech, clean tech and biotech.\nAcross programmes, the Commission proposes a ‘Sovereignty seal' enabling projects eligible under one programme but not fully funded to have better access to funding under other instruments.\nTo boost the investment capacity dedicated specifically to the priority of promoting European sovereignty, the Commission further proposes to allocate €10 billion.\nFinally, the Commission is setting up of a new ‘One-Stop-Shop' and a Sovereignty Portal to support project promoters access information about EU funding possibilities available at EU and national level. This should reinforce the possibilities for companies seeking to invest in Europe to have rapid and easy answers to funding and regulatory questions to facilitate their investment decision-making.\nWhat exactly is the Commission proposing to respond to global challenges beyond the war in Ukraine?\nIn view of the increasing number of crises and respective needs, the Commission is proposing to reinforce the EU budget with a view to:\nHow will the Commission make sure that the budget is fit to react to future crises?\nThe EU budget flexibilities and the possibilities for redeployments and reprioritisations are severely diminished after a few years of implementation. The MFF needs to be revised to cope with future crises and unexpected needs.\nFor this reason, the Commission proposes a reinforcement: the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve (SEAR) and the Flexibility instrument.\nThe SEAR can help non-EU countries with emerging needs stemming from conflicts, the global refugee crisis. Its resources can be used also to help tackling emergency situations due to major natural disasters or public health crises in Member States and accession countries. In 2021 and 2022 the requests received were far above the budget availability. As a result, not all needs could be met. A similar situation is expected for 2023. For this reason, the Commission proposes to increase the SEAR by €2.5 billion over the period 2024-2027.\nThe Flexibility Instrument can top up any programme for unforeseen needs and has been used extensively since 2021. Moreover, 75% of all budgetary margins for the 2021-2027 period have been used or earmarked. Therefore, reinforcing the Flexibility Instrument is necessary in an uncertain and volatile environment. The Commission therefore proposes to increase the Flexibility Instrument by €3 billion for the period 2024-2027.\nHow does the Commission intend to deal with increasing borrowing costs?\nSince the beginning of 2022, due to increasing uncertainty in financial markets and monetary policy tightening to respond to high inflation, bond market rates in the EU and beyond have risen significantly.\nThe pace of the increase in interest rates for all bond issuers, including the EU, has been one of the steepest witnessed in financial markets in the past decades. Interest rates on 10-year EU-Bonds have increased from 0.09% at the time of the inaugural 10-year NextGenerationEU bond in June 2021 to 3.09% in the most recent issuance in April 2023. Comparable increases have been observed for highly rated euro area sovereign issuers.\nThe sudden and sharp increase in interest rates has substantial budgetary implications. For the MFF 2021-2027, an amount of €14.9 billion (in current prices) under Heading 2b had been planned for covering the interest payments for NextGenerationEU non-repayable support. This was based on interest rate expectations back in 2020 (when long-term interest rates were historically low) and locked in the funds for the future 7 years.\nGiven the volatility of interest rates, planning those costs over the long term is prone to large deviations.\nTherefore, the Commission proposes to create, for the period 2024-2027 a new special instrument, over and above the ceilings, to coverexclusivelythe funding costs of NextGenerationEU in excess to what is currently planned in the MFF.\nWhy is there a need to increase expenditure for administration?\nThe new initiatives on which the EU had to deliver over the last two years came with substantial additional tasks for the European administration, without a corresponding increase in staff. Examples include the Digital Markets Act und Digital Services Act, support to Ukraine, the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), Fitfor55, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), REPowerEU. This has pushed the resources of European administration to the limit.\nRising inflation has put extra pressure on administrative resources and the EU's capacity to fulfil its legal obligations. The Commission has made exceptional efforts to reduce administrative costs and redeployed more than 900 posts internally since 2019. A new building policy, covering the 2022-2030 period, has significantly reduced office space. Drastic cuts have been introduced for missions, meeting and representation costs. While the Commission will continue to work in this direction, the leeway for reallocation is being used up. The current ceilings of heading 7 will not be sufficient to accommodate the actual needs triggered by the inflation and an update is needed.\nNEXT STEPS\nWhat is the timeframe for reaching an agreement on the MFF mid-term review?\nThe negotiations, including the Parliament's consent, must be concluded before the end of the year to alleviate the current budgetary pressures and release funds in support of Ukraine, migration and external needs, and competitiveness from January 2024.\nTimely approval of today's proposal is of the essence. The Commission counts on the incoming Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union to take work in the Council forward in view of a swift compromise immediately after the summer. This compromise could then be endorsed by the European Council in October.\nWhat is the impact of this proposal for the 2024 annual budget?\nThe Commission presented its proposal for an annual budget for 2024 on 7 June 2023.\nThe draft budget seeks to provide key funding to the EU's political priorities, with green and digital spending continuing to be prioritised to make Europe more resilient and fit for the future. However, it does not provide the necessary funding for Ukraine, competitiveness, the new Pact on Migration and Asylum and sustained external challenges and new emergencies.\nToday's proposal gives the EU the ability to act as a global partner, a conscious neighbour and in support of our businesses and citizens.\nOn the basis of the feedback received by EU Member States in the Council, the Commission stands ready to amend its proposal for a draft budget 2024 to reflect the outcome of the negotiations of today's MFF revision.\nFor More Information\nEU budget: Commission proposes to reinforce long-term EU budget to face most urgent challenges\nQuestions and Answers on EU budget: Commission proposes STEP to support European leadership on critical technologies\nPress release STEP\nSTEP web page\nUkraine: Commission proposes to set up a dedicated Facility to support Ukraine's recovery, reconstruction and modernisation\nFactsheet – A New Ukraine Facility\nQuestions and Answers – A new Ukraine Facility\nLegislative texts",

        "title": "Questions and Answers - Emissions Trading – Putting a Price on carbon *",
        "date": "Jul 14, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "1. What is the EUEmissionsTrading System?\nTheEU Emissions Trading System(ETS) works on the principle of ‘cap-and-trade'. It sets an absolute limit or ‘cap' on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year by the entities covered by the system. This cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.\nSince the EU ETS was introduced in 2005, emissions have been cut by 42.8% in the main sectors covered: power and heat generation and energy-intensive industrial installations. As a market-based system, the ETS ensures that emission reductions take place where it is cheapest to do so. As a result, most emission reductions until now have taken place in the power sector.\nUnder the EU ETS, regulated entities buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. At the end of each year, regulated entities must surrender enough allowances to cover all of their emissions. If a regulated entity reduces its emissions, it can keep the “saved” allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances. A Market Stability Reserve, in place since 2019, stabilises the market by removing surplus allowances from it.\nThe sectors covered by the existing EU ETS include power and heat generation, energy-intensive industrial sectors and aviation within Europe. The Commission has today proposed to apply emissions trading in other sectors through a separate new system, to build on the positive results of the current system, and to incentivise the transition to cleaner road transport and heating fuels through a carbon price.\n2. What reforms are you proposing to emissions trading?\nToday, the European Commission has presented alegislative proposalto revise the EU ETS in line with the EU's more ambitious target of achieving net emission reductions of at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The sectors currently covered by the EU ETS account for around 41% of the EU's total emissions, so their contribution is crucial to achieving the overall target.\nThe Commission is proposing that emissions from the current EU ETS sectors (including the extension to the maritime sector) be reduced by 61% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. This represents an increase of 18 percentage points compared to the current -43% contribution from the system to the EU's climate target. To reach this target, the Commission proposes a steeper annual emissions reduction of 4.2% (instead of 2.2% per year under the current system), following a one-off reduction of the overall emissions cap by 117 million allowances (‘re-basing'). The Commission alsoproposesto gradually remove free emissions allowances for the aviation sector, which is already covered by the EU ETS, and to move to full auctioning of allowances by 2027 to create a stronger price signal to drive emissions reduction.\nThe Commission alsoreviewed the Market Stability Reserveand proposes to strengthen it, enabling it to absorb the historical surplus of allowances more quickly and to ensure market stability, notably by maintaining the currently increased annual intake rate of allowances.\nThe Commission is also proposing to apply emissions trading in new sectors where sharper reductions are needed to reach the 2030 target. Under the proposal, emissions from maritime transport will be included in the existing EU ETS, while emissions from fuels used in road transport and building will be covered by a new, separate emissions trading system.\nThis new upstream system will regulate fuel suppliers rather than households and car drivers. It will become operational as of 2025, with a cap on emissions set from 2026, based on data collected under the Effort Sharing Regulation. During the first year, fuel suppliers will be required to hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit and to report their emissions for 2024 and 2025. The cap in the new ETS will be reduced annually to yield emissions reductions of 43% in 2030 compared to 2005. To address the social impacts arising from the fact that the fuel suppliers are likely to pass on some of their carbon costs to consumers buying road transport and heating fuels, the Commission has also presented a proposal for aSocial Climate Fund(see below).\n3. How will you apply emissions trading to buildings and road transport?\nThe overall EU target of at least -55% emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, cannot be reached without significant emissions reductions in buildings and road transport. In order to support other building- and transport-related policy measures, the Commission is proposing a new EU-wide emissions trading system, which will put a price on emissions from the building and the road transport sectors.\nThis new emissions trading will also work on the ‘cap and trade' principle to cut emissions in the most cost-effective way and shorten the pay-back time for energy saving investments in these sectors.\nThis separate upstream system will regulate fuel suppliers (rather than households and car drivers). The suppliers will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the quantity of fuels they place on the market and for surrendering emission allowances each calendar year depending on the carbon intensity of the fuels. This approach incentivises the fuel suppliers to decarbonise their product as this will reduce the cost of compliance with the emissions trading system.\nThe new system is designed to start in an orderly, smooth and efficient manner from 2026, while delivering a clear signal on ambition. A certain amount of allowances would be frontloaded. The Market Stability Reserve will also operate in these new sectors. A specific mechanism is also proposed to contain excessive increases in the carbon price. One year ahead of the introduction of carbon pricing for the buildings and road transport sectors, a Social Climate Fund will start operating to address the social challenges that vulnerable groups in society may face as a result of the new emissions trading system.\nCarbon pricing in itself does not address all barriers to the deployment of low- and zero-emissions solutions in road transport and buildings. These sectors will still be covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation, which means national policies will continue to contribute to reducing emissions in these sectors. Strong regulatory measures on energy efficiency, renewables, ecodesign, energy performance of buildings, CO2emission standards for cars and charging infrastructure will also drive the shift towards greener transport and buildings.\n4. What measures will you take to support sectors and households impacted by the reforms?\nThe reforms are accompanied by measures helping the regulated entities to meet the higher ambition. The Commission proposes to make more money available for innovative technologies and to modernise the energy system. To overcome the low-carbon innovation investment gap and to address distributional effects of emission trading, the Commission proposes to increase the size of the Modernisation Fund by 2.5% allowances from the total quantity. In addition, the Innovation Fund will be topped up, among other sources, from the auctioning of allowances that would otherwise be allocated for free to industry sectors covered by theCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The Commission also proposes to further incentivise innovative low-carbon technologies through the free allocation rules.\nThe Commission further proposes to set up a new Social Climate Fund to address social impacts of the extension of emissions trading to road transport and buildings on vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users. The fund should provide funding to Member States to grant temporary income support and to support measures and investments intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels through increased energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonisation of heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of energy from renewable sources, and granting improved access to zero- and low-emission mobility and transport.\nThe Social Climate Fund would be financed by the EU budget, using an amount equivalent to 25% of the expected revenues of emissions trading for building and road transport fuels. It will provide €72.2 billion of funding to Member States, for the period 2025-2032, based on a targeted amendment to the multiannual financial framework. With a proposal to draw on matching Member State funding, the Fund would mobilise €144.4 billion for a socially fair transition. Member States should use their auction revenues from the emissions trading for building and road transport fuels to finance parts of their national contributions to the Fund.\n5. How does the proposal change the rules on aviation under the EU ETS?\nSignificant emissions reductions in the aviation sector are needed to reach our 2030 climate targets. Despite flights within the European Economic Area (EEA) being covered by the EU ETS since 2012, aviation emissions in Europe increased an average of 5% year-on-year between 2013 and 2018. While there has been a recent reduction in air traffic as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation emissions are still projected to grow further. The Commission isproposing to revise the ETS aviation rulesto create an effective price signal and ensure that the sector contributes its fair share. Flights within the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as flights to Switzerland and the UK, will continue to be covered by the EU ETS. The total number of aviation allowances in the ETS will be capped at current levels, and be reduced annually by 4.2% (linear reduction factor). The number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators will be reduced progressively, with the aim of stopping free allocation to aviation by the end of 2026.\nIn parallel, theproposal implementsthe Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for extra-European flights. The EU ETS Directive will apply CORSIA to EU-based airlines' emissions from flights to and from countries outside the EEA. When emissions from flights outside the EEA reach levels above 2019 they will have to be offset with corresponding carbon credits. These credits should contribute to achieving emissions reductions in various sectors of the economy, such as renewable energy or waste management in countries that participate in the Paris Agreement and from 2027 in CORSIA. Offset credits must be reliably accounted for to avoid them being counted twice. Each offset credit should represent a tonne of CO2that has been reduced or avoided.\n6. How will maritime transport be included in the revised EU ETS?\nTo ensure that the maritime transport sector contributes to the EU's climate ambitions, the Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the EU's Emissions Trading System to cover CO2emissions from large ships (above 5000 gross tonnage), regardless of the flag they fly. The extension will include all emissions from ships calling at an EU port for voyages within the EU (intra-EU) as well as 50% of the emissions from voyages starting or ending outside of the EU (extra-EU voyages), and emissions that occur when ships are at berth in EU ports.\nUnder the proposal, the EU ETS would cover around two thirds of maritime transport emissions (90 million tonnes CO2) and result in a price signal that incentivises improvements in energy efficiency and low-carbon solutions and reduces the price difference between alternative fuels and traditional maritime fuels. The proposal builds on the provisions in place for other EU ETS sectors as well as the existing EU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification System for shipping, which tracks CO2emissions from ships calling at all EU ports. In the FuelEU Maritime proposal, also presented today, the Commission proposes to increase the uptake of alternative, low-carbon fuels in maritime to help drive down emissions faster.\nIn practice, shipping companies will have to purchase and surrender ETS emission allowances for each tonne of reported CO2emissions. For the administration of the system, shipping companies will be attributed to an administering authority of a Member State that will ensure compliance using the same rules as for the other sectors. In addition to the EU ETS rules on penalties, ships can be denied entry to EU ports where the responsible shipping company has failed to surrender the necessary allowances for two or more consecutive years.\nTo ensure a smooth transition, shipping companies will only have to surrender allowances for a portion of their emissions during an initial phase-in period, reaching 100% after 3 years. A reporting and review clause is included to monitor the implementation of the rules applicable to the maritime sector and to take account of relevant developments at the level of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n7. How are the revenues from emissions trading used?\nAuction revenues from the existing ETS go mainly to Member States' budgets, and are used predominantly to tackle climate change. Under the existing EU ETS, Member States are required to spend at least half of their auction revenues to support greenhouse gas emissions reductions, to deploy renewables and carbon capture and storage, and to improve energy efficiency and district heating. Rising carbon prices in the existing EU ETS since 2018 have brought about an increase in the auction revenues available to spend on climate action. In 2018-2020, revenues amounted to €14-16 billion annually. On average, Member States spent 70% of these revenues for climate- and energy-related purposes.\nBased on the Commission's proposal, Member States will be required to spend their auction revenues from emissions trading on climate- and energy-related projects, including decarbonisation in the road transport and buildings sectors. This includes investments in zero-emissions vehicles and mobility, energy efficiency improvements and renovations in buildings, as well as financial support in order to address social aspects. Furthermore, Member States should use a part of their revenues from emissions trading in the road transport and building sectors on measures to support vulnerable households and transport users and to match funding under the Social Climate Fund.\nUnder the existing EU ETS, a portion of allowances is auctioned for the Innovation Fund and the Modernisation Fund, which respectively support breakthrough innovations towards climate neutrality across the EU and power sector modernisation in lower-income Member States. The Commission proposes to increase both funds to help overcome the low-carbon innovation investment gap and to address distributional effects between Member States, specifically the proportionally greater challenge in meeting the EU's climate target in Member States that rely more on fossil fuels for power generation.\nThe Innovation Fund, currently sourced from 450 million allowances from the existing ETS in 2021-30, would be topped up with 50 million allowances and 150 million allowances from the new system covering emissions from road transport and buildings. In addition, allowances which would otherwise be allocated for free to industry sectors covered by theCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanismwill now be auctioned and added to the Innovation Fund.\nThe Modernisation Fund, endowed with 2% of the total number of allowances for 2021-30 under the existing EU ETS, would be increased through the auctioning of an additional 2.5% of allowances. The top up would benefit Member States with GDP per capita below 65% of the EU average.\nThe Commission also proposes to set up a new Social Climate Fund to address social impacts of emissions trading in road transport and buildings sectors on vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users. Resources from this Fund should correspond to approximately 25% of the expected auction revenues from the new system in 2026-2032. It should provide funding to Member States to support policies and measures that seek to alleviate and mitigate social impacts of extending emissions trading. This includes temporary income support and measures and investments intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonising the heating and cooling of buildings - including the integration of energy from renewable sources - and granting improved access to zero- and low-emission mobility and transport.\n8. Will there still be protection against carbon leakage through the granting of free allowances?\nFree allowances will remain an important tool to protect energy-intensive industry against the risk of carbon leakage until at least 2030. However, with the reduction of the overall emissions cap, the number of free allowances will also be reduced. The Commission proposes that these reductions occur only in the second half of the decade.\nThe proposal does not change the basic rules for calculating the free allocation received by installations under the EU ETS. Free allocation will continue to be based on benchmarks representing the level of performance of the best installations. With its review of the carbon leakage framework, the Commission aims to allocate free allowances in a more targeted way and to incentives the uptake of low-carbon technologies. The maximum annual reduction rate of the benchmark values will increase from 2026 onwards, shifting more free allocation to sectors that are harder to decarbonise.\nThe scope of the ETS is broadened so that installations using low-carbon or zero-carbon technologies may in the future benefit from continued free allocation. Moreover, free allocation will be made conditional on decarbonisation efforts: installations not implementing cost-efficient measures as recommended in energy audits will have their free allowances reduced by up to 25%.\nFinally, the Commission has put forward aproposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism(CBAM), which addresses the risk of carbon leakage for a targeted number of sectors, by pricing the carbon content of products imported to the EU. If importers can prove, based on verified information from third-country producers, that a carbon price has already been paid during the production of the imported goods, the corresponding amount can be deducted. It is an environmental policy measure that ensures that the EU's climate ambition is not undermined because of less ambitious climate policies adopted in other parts of the world. The CBAM is an alternative to free allocation, and as such the two measures should not overlap. To ensure a smooth transition from one system to the other, free allocation under the EU ETS will be gradually phased out as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is phased in for these sectors.\n9. How will the revision ensure stability in the carbon market?\nThe EU ETS is a market-based mechanism, which means that the carbon price is determined by supply and demand of allowances. The cap on emissions ensures that the environmental objectives are reached, and tradability of allowances ensures that these reductions are achieved in a cost-efficient way.\nIn response to a considerable surplus of allowances on the EU's carbon market, with corresponding effects on the price signal, the Market Stability Reserve started operating from 2019. As part of the first review of the Market Stability Reserve this year, the Commission is now proposing a small number of changes to the rules for the operation of the reserve. The Market Stability Reserve is a fully rules-based mechanism, and does not allow the Commission to intervene in the market at its discretion. Instead, it automatically places allowances in the reserve or releases them in case pre-defined thresholds are crossed. The legislative proposal contains an amendment enabling a smoother placing of allowances in the reserve the closer the surplus on the market is to the relevant threshold.\nThe Commission also proposes that the Market Stability Reserve operates in the new emissions trading system for road transport and heating fuels, with specific rules. Additional measures are also proposed to mitigate a potential risk of excessive price increases in the new system through a release of allowances from the reserve under certain conditions.\nFor more information\nIP - Legislative Proposals to transform the Economy and Society to meet our Climate Targets\nDelivering the European Green Deal – dedicated webpage(including legislative proposals)\nDelivering the European Green Deal – videos and photos\nMore information on Climate Action proposals\n*: updated on 16/7/2021 - 15.20",

        "date": "Nov 30, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Thank you again, Madame President, for being with us this morning.\nAnd thank you, Diego, for your insightful presentation.\nBefore we dive into the today's discussion, I would like to share some observations.\nFirst of all, let me inform you that I have asked my five colleagues, senior officials of the Commission whom you know well, to join this discussion.\nWe also have gathered today the representatives of the key strategic energy-intensive sectors, including metals, fertilisers, ceramic, cement, refineries, chemicals, glass, lime, waste, pulp and paper, as well as producers of clean energy and alternative energy carriers, off-takers and financial institutions.\nLet me start by saying thatenergy-intensive industries are a pillar of the EU's economy. You play a vital role, employing millions of people and generating significant added economic value.\nAnd I know how hard you have been hit by recent challenges, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and then Russia's war against Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.\nTo mitigate the negative impacts these challenges have had on European businesses, the Commission put in place a number of measures, including:\nThe energy situation has now somewhat stabilised; however today'sgas prices are still twice as high compared to pre-crisis levels. So I know the impact they have on your businesses is still very significant.And, while there is no imminent risk to our security of supply, we have to accept that energy prices are likely to remain above historic levels for the foreseeable future.There is no silver bullet to lower them. Rather, we need to double down on our overall aims.\nThat meansaccelerating the green transition: we mustscale up renewables roll out, improve energy efficiency, invest in energy storage solutions and in hydrogen, and enhance our domestic manufacturing capacity of clean technologies.\nThe European Green Deal plays a vital role in this. It is not only our plan to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. It is alsoEurope's growth strategy. It fosters innovation and competitiveness, while helping ensure we leave a planet liveable for future generations.\nThe Green Deal is also strengthening our open strategic autonomy, enabling Europe to remain aglobal leader when it comes to green tech and clean tech.\nFor example, we are acting toreform Europe's electricity, gas and hydrogen markets to boost investment in cheaper, renewable and decarbonised sources of energy.\nBut, I am aware that the geopolitical landscape has changed, and the EU today faces challenges, such as unfair competition on global markets.\nThis is why we are taking action now toprotectthecompetitiveness of our economy and of our industry. We want you to stay in Europe, and thrive in Europe.\nWith the Net Zero Industrial Act we are positioning Europe as a hub for clean technology and industrial innovation.\nWe have adopted tools tomake sure your companies can compete on an equal footingwith those established outside of the EU, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, orCBAM.\nWe have also mobilised financial support for energy industries, in particular through theInnovation Fund, although I am aware that the financing needs are much bigger.\nAnd I recognise that we will need to do even more, and advance even faster, to overcome the challenges facing us.\nBut we will only be able to achieve that if we all work together. So I want to be clear that we are fully committed to strengthening our engagement with you on this joint endeavour, and listening to what you have to say.\nThat is why we are here today, to discuss how the actions we have already taken can help you in the future. Andwhat more we can do to create the right environment for the sectors you represent to thrive in the EU, and turn the corner of competitiveness, innovation and decarbonisation.\nWe want to hear your views about the prospects of decarbonisation for energy intensive industries andlisten to any ideas you may have for specific measures, which could accelerate this process and enhance the industry's competitiveness.\nI would alsoencourage you to share positive experiences, as well as best practices that you applied in your businesses– cooperation to boost innovativeness, clean solutions that you applied, funding possibilities that you explored.",

        "title": "Address to the 2023 EU Tax Symposium",
        "date": "Oct 25, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "[Introduction]\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nDistinguished guests,\nHonourable Members,\nIt is a great pleasure to speak at this second edition of the Tax Symposium. I am very happy to see such a large attendance here in this hemicycle and online. This shows there is a strong and growing interest in EU tax policy.\nOur citizens see taxation as one of the areas where the EU dimension needs to be further developed and strengthened to tackle the challenges of our time. This emerged clearly from the Conference on the Future of Europe. And it is something to which both the Commission and the European Parliament attach the highest political importance. Which is why the choice of hosting this Symposium together, here, in the house of European democracy, is no coincidence.\nBefore I turn to what I see as the priorities for the future of taxation, let me recall where we have come from.\n[Achievements]\nWe are entering the final stretch of a mandate that has been nothing short of extraordinary, given the succession of crises we have faced. And equally unprecedented was our response. With our common approach on vaccines. With common borrowing to relaunch our economies in an unprecedented show of solidarity under NextGenerationEU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). With our green strategy, supported by innovative measures like the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). With common initiatives to address the energy crisis. With our unity in supporting Ukraine.\nTaxation has been a centrepiece of our response. We adopted VAT waivers for vaccines. We committed to find new own resources to finance the RRF and have already put on the table the Emissions Trading System, CBAM and a corporate profit-based statistical contribution, pending the adoption of BEFIT, our proposed new framework for business taxation. We provided guidance to Member States on energy taxation measures. And we took other measures beyond taxation, like the solidarity contribution on the windfall profits of oil companies.\nEven as we have tackled these crises, we have driven forward an ambitious agenda for tax reform – in the EU and beyond.\nThe international tax agreement was the landmark achievement of the past few years. This agreement represents an opportunity to put an end to the race to the bottom in corporate taxation. This was unthinkable just a few years ago. And it wouldn't have been possible without the EU's tireless efforts.\nEurope is leading the way in making this agreement a reality. The 15% global minimum tax rate will generate some USD 220 billion more in global tax revenues per year, according to the OECD. Introduced in the EU with the Pillar 2 directive, it will allow Member States to raise much-needed resources, at a time when public budgets are strained and the need to invest in the digital, green and social transition more pressing than ever.\nOver the course of this mandate, we have also brought our fight against aggressive tax planning, tax evasion and avoidance to a new level.\nWe strengthened the framework for the automatic exchange of information between tax administrations, covering new areas like crypto-assets. We achieved the much-awaited agreement on the VAT rates directive. And we proposed new rules to make our VAT systems fit for the digital age and reduce VAT fraud. We provided input to try to make the Code of Conduct Group and the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions stronger and more effective. Within the framework of their recovery and resilience plans, Member States have committed to close part of the loopholes in their national legislation which create opportunities for tax evasion and fraud. We have also tabled legislative initiatives aimed at tackling the inconsistencies that undermine trust between Member States and creating a sound tax environment for EU citizens and businesses. To name but two of them:\nFASTER, which aims to make withholding tax procedures more efficient and secure.\nUNSHELL, a key initiative to address the misuse of shell entities for improper tax purposes.\nThe global and European efforts against tax evasion and tax avoidance are bearing fruit. The VAT gap has halved. At the beginning of this mandate, Member States were losing more than EUR 120 billion in uncollected VAT – every year. This loss now stands at an estimated EUR 60 billion.\nAnd tax evasion by private individuals has shrunk substantially over the past decade, according to the EU Tax Observatory's Global Report.\nThese results are a testament to our commitment to build a fairer economic system, with taxation as an essential part of that effort.\nWe can be proud of these achievements. But our work is far from over.\n[Remaining work]\nA number of important proposals I have mentioned still need to be adopted, including FASTER, UNSHELL and VAT in the Digital Age.\nIn September, we also put forward a package of measures that will massively simplify our tax framework for bigger and smaller companies alike, including a new framework for business income taxation (BEFIT) which builds on Pillar 2 of the global tax agreement.\nWe must use every remaining opportunity until the end of the mandate to make progress on, and finalise where possible, the files that are still pending.\nChief among these is Pillar 1 of the global tax agreement, the implementation of which requires a Multilateral Convention to be signed. We are working together with our partners to ensure that this can happen as soon as possible.\n[Future reflections]\nMore broadly, as we reflect on the future of tax policy, I see three areas where changes are needed:\nFirst, we must put in place a more effective tax mix – one that is more conducive to sustainable growth and reduces inequalities. Last year's Eurobarometer survey found that 80% of European citizens believe income inequality is too high. And two thirds believe taxation has a role to play in redressing this. So this is an area where our citizens expect us to deliver.\nRebalancing the different tax burdens between labour and capital could be part of the solution. Earlier this year the Commission registered a European Citizens' Initiative on wealth taxation. Several European political families have made it a priority also in view of the next elections for the European Parliament. This is an area which raises several difficult questions, but we should not shy away from the debate.\nIndirect and green taxation can also play a stronger role in the tax mix, while taking care to avoid possible regressive impacts. We should continue to work on the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive. And we must address distortions to competition between EU and non-EU businesses.\nThe second main challenge concerns digitalisation and the changing nature of work. The way business is conducted has radically changed. Pillar 1 is imperative to ensure that very large corporates contribute their fair share to the societies in which they operate and prosper. This is not merely a matter of fiscal policy; it is a question of equity and social responsibility.\nBut other structural phenomena question and challenge our tax systems. Think of the rise of digital nomadism across borders, and what this means for personal income taxation. Tax policy must remain ahead of the curve. We must avoid the emergence of new loopholes and opportunities for evasion, of course. But we should also prevent national taxation systems from hampering freedom of movement and the integration of the European labour market.\nThird, we must innovate not just our policies, but also our decision-making methods. It is high time to recognise that unanimity in the field of taxation is too often holding us back. And it comes at the cost of deadlocks and lowest common denominator solutions. We are seeing it now with our UNSHELL proposal, which despite the strong support from this House, is still moving very slowly in the Council. We need UNSHELL to become unstuck. I believe that in certain cases, moving from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the Council and co-decision – which the European Parliament has strongly pleaded for – must be a priority for the future.\n[Conclusion]\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nOur journey is not over, our work is not done.\nOur economies and societies face enormous challenges: Making a success of the green and digital transition. Reducing inequalities. Strengthening our competitiveness. Reconciling debt sustainability with massive investment needs. Tax policy has a role to play in every one of these.\nThese challenges might seem daunting, but if there is one thing we have learned during this mandate, it is that it always seems impossible until it's done. Where there is a political will, there is a way. That is why I am optimistic that the EU can rise to the challenge – on tax matters and beyond.\nThe campaign for the upcoming European elections is an opportunity to take forward this reflection. To forge a new common path. It should not be wasted.\nThank you.",

        "text": "Le mécanisme d'ajustement carbone aux frontières (CBAM) commence à s'appliquer dans sa phase transitoire\nCe dimanche 1er octobre, le mécanisme d'ajustement carbone aux frontières (CBAM) entrera en application dans sa phase transitoire. Le CBAM est l'outil phare de l'UE pour lutter contre les fuites de carbone, et l'un des piliers centraux de l'ambitieux programme « Fit for 55 » de l'UE. Il permettra d'égaliser le prix du carbone entre les produits nationaux et les importations. Ainsi, les politiques climatiques de l'UE ne seront pas compromises par la délocalisation de la production vers des pays où les normes écologiques sont moins ambitieuses ou par le remplacement de produits européens par des importations à plus forte intensité de carbone. Le CBAM est une mesure compatible avec les règles de l'OMC qui encourage l'industrie mondiale à adopter des technologies plus écologiques et plus durables.\nLa phase de transition servira de période d'apprentissage pour toutes les parties prenantes (importateurs, producteurs et autorités). Elle permettra à la Commission européenne de recueillir des informations utiles sur les émissions incorporées, et d'affiner la méthodologie pour la période définitive, qui débutera en 2026. À partir de cette date, les importateurs devront acheter et restituer le nombre de \"certificats CBAM\" correspondant aux GES incorporés dans les produits CBAM importés.\nLa Commission met également progressivement à disposition desoutils détailléspour aider les entreprises à mettre en place le mécanisme de transition.\nUn communiqué de presse estdisponible en ligne.\n(Pour plus d'informations : Daniel Ferrie – Tél.: +32 2 298 65 00; Francesca Dalboni – Tél.: +32 2 298 81 70)\nLutte contre la violence à l'égard des femmes : la convention d'Istanbul entre en vigueur pour l'UE\nLe 1 octobre, la convention d'Istanbul entrera en vigueur pour l'UE.La convention d'Istanbul est un cadre juridique complet visant à protéger les femmes contre toutes les formes de violence.Il vise à prévenir, à poursuivre et à éliminer la violence à l'égard des femmes et la violence domestique, ainsi qu'à mettre en œuvre des politiques globales et coordonnées.\nL'UE dans son ensemble accepte d'être liée par la convention et ses États membres devront mettre en œuvre des mesures. La vice-présidente chargée des valeurs et de la transparence, VeraJourová, a déclaré :« La violence à l'égard des femmes meurtrit l'ensemble de nos sociétés démocratiques. Une femme sur trois a subi des violences physiques ou sexuelles depuis l'âge de 15 ans. Trop d'entre elles ne le signalent pas. Trop de délinquants restent impunis. Nous devons agir et la convention d'Istanbul est notre réponse juridique pour renforcer les droits des femmes. Nous continuerons d'encourager les États membres à prendre les mesures nécessaires pour prévenir la violence à l'égard des femmes et garantir une protection et un soutien efficaces à toutes les victimes ».\nHelenaDalli, commissaire chargée de l'égalité, a déclaré :« L'entrée en vigueur de la convention d'Istanbul constitue une étape importante pour l'UE. Ce cadre de référence reconnaît que la violence à l'égard des femmes constitue une violation de leurs droits fondamentaux. Pour que nous puissions tous et toutes vivre dans une Union européenne juste et équitable, les femmes et les filles doivent pouvoir vivre à l'abri de l'insécurité, de la peur et de la violence quotidiennes. L'entrée en vigueur historique d'aujourd'hui constitue un bon pas dans cette direction.»\n(Pour plus d'informations : Christian Wigand - Tél.: +32 2 296 22 53 ; Jördis Ferroli – Tél.: +32 2 299 27 29, Marajke Slomka - Tél. : +32 2 298 26 13)\nEurope's Beating Cancer Plan: First prototype of the Cancer Image Europe platform goes live\nToday, theEuropean Cancer Imaging Initiativehas reached a first major milestone: as of today, theCancer Image Europe platformlinks up 36 datasets of images of 9 cancer types(breast, colon, lung, prostate, rectum, liver, glioma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma), for a total ofover 200,000 image seriesof about20,000 individuals. A first version of the rules that will apply for data providers and users, as well as the operational procedures for the platform have also been published.\nThe Initiative aims to deliver aEuropean federated infrastructure of cancer images data to support healthcare providers, research institutes and innovators in making the best use of innovative data-driven solutions for diagnostics, cancer treatment and care,for the benefit of cancer patients.\nThierryBreton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said: “With the launch of the Cancer Image Europe platform, we are harnessing the power of data in our fight against cancer. We are paving the way towards a cross-border, interoperable and secure infrastructure for cancer imaging data in Europe, in line with EU values and rules. This will boost the development of new AI-driven technologies for better cancer care.”\nStellaKyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:“Digital technologies will revolutionise healthcare, especially when it comes to cancer detection, treatment and care. As part of Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, the European Cancer Imaging Initiative will be key in making early detection through screening more precise, timely and accessible and help us develop of the next generation of cancer diagnostics and treatments.”\nIn line with theEuropean Strategy for Dataand theEuropean Health Data Space, the European Cancer Imaging Initiative launched in December 2022 is one of the flagships ofEurope's Beating Cancer Plan. The Cancer Image Europe platform that is under the Initiative is supported by theDigital Europe Programmewith€18 million. TheEuropean Digital Innovation Hubsunder the Digital Europe Programme will support the rollout of the technologies that are relevant to this.\nThe first version of this digital infrastructure, delivered by theEuropean Federation for Cancer Images (EUCAIM) project, features a public catalogue of cancer imaging datasets from the repositories of EU-funded projects related to Artificial Intelligence for Health Imaging, as well as a search tool to understand the information available at the data providers' sites across EU.\nMore information is availablehere.\n(For more information: Johannes Bahrke – Tel.: +32 2 295 86 15; Stefan De Keersmaecker – Tel.: +32 2 298 46 80; Marietta Grammenou – Tel.: +32 2 298 35 83; Célia Dejond – Tel.: +32 2 298 81 99)\nNuit européenne deschercheurs :le plus grand événement scientifique d'Europe aura lieu dans 27 pays\nAujourd'hui, laNuit européenne des chercheurs, le plus grand événement européen de promotion du monde scientifique, se déroule dans 27 pays, dont plusieurs États membres de l'UE et pays associés à Horizon Europe. Les enfants, les jeunes et les familles auront la chance de découvrir le travail des chercheurs à travers des activités divertissantes telles que des présentations scientifiques, des expériences pratiques, des jeux et des concours. L'événement, qui attire plus d'un million et demi de visiteurs chaque année, met en valeur la diversité de la recherche et de l'innovation européennes, ainsi que leur impact sur la vie quotidienne des citoyens, et rapproche les scientifiques du grand public afin de stimuler l'intérêt pour les carrières de recherche, en particulier parmi les jeunes.\nIlianaIvanova, commissaire chargée de l'innovation, la recherche, la culture, l'éducation et la jeunesse, a déclaré :«Cette année encore, le monde scientifique se réunit pour célébrer la Nuit européenne des chercheurs, allumant l'étincelle de la curiosité dans les yeux des visiteurs et de la prochaine génération de scientifiques.Je vous invite tous à faire partie de cette expérience unique pour découvrir les merveilles de la science et apprendre des chercheurs les plus compétents d'Europe.»\nPar ailleurs, dans le cadre de l'Année européenne des compétences, les projets de la Nuit européenne des chercheurs organisent également tout au long de l'année des activités dans le cadre de l'initiativeChercheurs dans les écoles, qui favorise l'interaction entre les chercheurs et les élèves des écoles primaires et secondaires. L'initiative touchera plus de 2 400 écoles et impliquera plus de 224 000 élèves d'ici fin 2024.\nLa Nuit européenne des chercheurs et Chercheurs dans les écoles sont des initiatives financées par lesactions Marie Skłodowska-Curiede la Commission.

They cover key reforms in the areas of the green and digital transition, such as the adoption of the decarbonisation law and the entry into force of the law for the governance of cloud services deployed in the public sector. Romania has also put forward reforms to improve its public policy delivery, promote tourism and culture, develop human resources in the health sector, improve tax collection and the sustainability of pensions, modernise the education system's infrastructure, as well as to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption.\nPayments under the RRF are performance-based and contingent on Romania implementing the investments and reforms outlined in its recovery and resilience plan.\nOn 16 December 2022, Romania submitted to the Commission a second request for payment of €2.8 billion under the RRF, covering 51 milestones and targets. On 27 June 2023, the Commissionadopteda partially positive preliminary assessment of Romania's request for payment, having found that two milestones related to energy investments had not been satisfactorily fulfilled. The Commission acknowledged the first steps already taken by Romania to fulfil these outstanding milestones, though important work remains to be done. The steps to be taken under the ‘payment suspension' procedure to give Member States additional time to fulfil outstanding milestones, are explained in thisQ&A document.\nThe opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee on Romania's payment request has paved the way for the Commission to adopt a decision on the disbursement of the funds linked to the 49 milestones and targets that have been assessed as satisfactorily fulfilled.\nTheoverall recovery and resilience plan of Romaniawill be financed bymore than €29 billionin grants and loans.The amounts of payments made to Member States are published on theRecovery and Resilience Scoreboard. Romania already received a total pre-financing payment of €3.7 billion in December 2021 and January 2022 and €2.6 billion in October 2022, following the fulfilment of the 21 milestones and targets included in the first payment request.\nMore information on the RRF payment claim process can be found in thisQ&A document.

Once the Agreement is ratified by Moldova, it will provisionally apply until the full entry into force on 1 January 2024.\nThis major step of Moldova joining the foundation of the EU's disaster risk management system was marked with a visit by the Commissioner for Crisis Management, JanezLenarčič, to Chișinău, where he met Minister of Internal Affairs Adrian Efros. They both signed the Agreement to grant Moldova membership status in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\nCommissioner for Crisis Management, JanezLenarčič, said:“Today, I am proud to welcome Moldova to the family of European rescuers: the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. While Russia's brutal attack against Ukraine resulted in thousands of Ukrainians fleeing from the war, Moldova proved itself to be a reliable partner. I want to thank the Moldovan civil protection authorities for their hard work. By Moldova joining the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, we can significantly enhance our emergency preparedness and build a more resilient disaster risk management system in Europe. We are stronger together.”\nMoldova has benefitted from the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to cope with a large-scale displacement triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this year, the EU has also deployed 36 power generators to 30 hospitals across Moldova from its rescEU energy reserve. Additionally, the EU has also supported Moldova with EUR 48 million in humanitarian aid since the start of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\nAs a full member of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, Moldova will not only be able to receive immediate support, but can also send assistance to countries affected by man-made or natural disasters through the Mechanism, leading to a stronger and better coordinated crisis response in Europe and in the rest of the world.\nThe press release is availableonline.\n(For more information: Balazs Ujvari - Tel.: +32 2 295 45 78; Daniel Puglisi - Tel.: +32 2 296 91 40)\nHealthy seas: Commission leads common efforts to improve state of Baltic Sea\nToday, CommissionerSinkevičiusis hosting thesecond edition of the‘Our Baltic' Conferencetoaddress pressing environmental challenges in the Baltic Sea.

It will also be more environmentally-friendly, with stricter carbon dioxide (CO2) emission limits to better align with theEuropean Green Deal, and will contribute to ending dependence on Russian fossil fuels, under theREPowerEU Plan.\nBelgium notified to the Commission its plans to modify its capacity mechanism approved by  the Commission inAugust 2021(SA.54915). The modified scheme, with a budget of €4 billion, will run until October 2031.\nBelgium notified to the Commission modifications aimed at increasing the environmental-friendliness and cost-efficiency of the capacity mechanism. These modifications include: (i)tightened carbon dioxide emissionlimitsfor beneficiaries; (ii) a change in thefinancingmechanism (in the context of a broader reform of the Belgian Electricity Act); and (iii)improvements to the daily operationof the capacity mechanism based on experience gained during the first two capacity auctions held in Belgium.\nThe capacity mechanism is open to all technologies, in particular: (i) all electricity generation units, (ii) demand-response units and (iii) storage units, with the objective of ensuring their availability when the balance between supply and demand may be at risk. The capacity mechanism is also open to capacity providers active in other Member States. The beneficiaries will be selected through a competitive bidding process.\nThe Commission assessed the modifications under EU State aid rules, in particularArticle 107(3)(c)of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU'), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and theGuidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy 2022(CEEAG).\nCommissioner DidierReynders, in charge of competition policy, said:“Belgium's capacity mechanism, including the amendments approved today, contributes to ensuring security of electricity supply. At the same time, the scheme ensures that possible distortions of competition are kept to a minimum. The more environmental-friendly design of the mechanism is a positive development towards the achievement of the European Green Deal objectives.

This measure will complement the Greek public support that was approved by the Commission inJune 2021(SA.55526).\nThe Greek authorities notified the Commission of its plans to grant additional aid to Gastrade SA, the promoter and operator of the new terminal. The measure is aimed at enabling the beneficiary to complete the construction of the terminal as planned by end-2023. The aid will take the form of a direct grant.\nThe Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, in particularArticle 107(3)(c)of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which allows Member States to support the development of certain economic activities under certain conditions, and the2022 Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy(‘CEEAG'). The Commission found that the measure is necessary and appropriate to enable to beneficiary to continue with the project as planned. When approving the initial public support, the Commission had already considered that the project is needed to secure gas supply for Greece and the South-Eastern Europe region and that it will contribute to theREPowerEUstrategic objective to achieve diversification of energy supplies and end dependence on Russian fossil fuels. The Commission concluded that the positive effects of the measure outweigh any possible negative effects on competition and trade in the EU. On this basis, the Commission approved the Greek measure under EU State aid rules.\nThe non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the number SA.105781 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetitionwebsite once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 2 298 70 24; Sara Simonini- Tel.: +32 2 298 33 67)\nState aid: Commission approves amendment to 2022-2027 regional aid map for Bulgaria\nThe European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, an amendment to Bulgaria's map for granting regional aid until 31 December 2027, within the framework of the regional aid guidelines.\nOn15 December 2021, the Commission approved the 2022-2027 regional aid map for Bulgaria. On30 May 2023, the Commission adopted a Communication regarding a possiblemid-term reviewof the regional aid maps, taking into account updated statistics.\nIn this context, the amendment to Bulgaria's regional aid map approved today enables higher maximum amounts of aid to investments in regions experiencing a decrease in population. The maximum amounts of aid will increase from 50% to 60% of the eligible investment costs in the regions of Veliko Tarnovo, Ruse and Silistra. In Pernik, the maximum amounts of aid will increase from 20% to 25% until the end of 2024 and from 15% to 20% from 2025 until the end of 2027. The amended map will be in force from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2027.\nThe non-confidential version of today's decision will be made available under the case number SA.108623 in theState aid registeron the Commission'scompetitionwebsite once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.\n(For more information: Arianna Podesta – Tel.: +32 2 298 70 24; Sara Simonini- Tel.: +32 2 298 33 67)\nConcentrations : la Commission autorise l'acquisition de sept filiales de Swiss Steel par Jacquet Metals\nLa Commission européenne a approuvé, en vertu du règlement européen sur les concentrations, l'acquisition du contrôle exclusif de sept filiales contrôlées par Swiss Steel Holding AG, basée en Suisse, par Jacquet Metals S.A., basée en France.\nLa transaction concerne principalement le secteur de la distribution de produits en acier en Estonie, Hongrie, Lettonie, Lituanie, Pologne, Tchéquie et Slovaquie.\nLa Commission a conclu que l'acquisition envisagée ne soulèverait pas de problème de concurrence, compte tenu de son impact limité sur la concurrence sur les marchés où les parties sont actives.

        "title": "Opening remarks by Commissioner Hoekstra at the Clean Transition Dialogue with the construction sector",
        "date": "Apr 9, 2024",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Fantastic to have you here all around the table.\nI see a number of familiar faces and I had the opportunity to at least briefly connect with most of the others. I wanted to thank you very much for being here and having the opportunity to have this dialogue with all of us.\nWelcome and thank you very much for being here with us.\nI'm also truly delighted not only to have this conversation but to have it as part of the Clean Transition Dialogue, today on construction. This initiative was launched by our president, by President Ursulavon der Leyen, in 2023 and it is meant to support the decarbonisation of our industry.\nAnd I feel today is an opportunity to exchange views and to hear your thoughts. Please feel completely at liberty to be critical, to mention what is on your mind, but what I continue to say whenever I meet friends from businesses: please don't treat this as a one-off.\nI do feel there is more that we need to do, both from the political side, but also from the business side to make sure we connect, we reconnect, and we have this dialogue in Europe. And knowing the world of business relatively well myself, there is more that we can do together to basically facilitate this.\nThe door of the Commission and also mine is always open.\n***\nThe next thing I would like to say is a bit preaching to the choir, but it is important to acknowledge is that construction is an economic powerhouse. It employs, directly and indirectly 25 million people and it contributes to 10% of the EU's gross domestic product and that already is a very important reason to strengthen our dialogue.\nIf you then further go into the numbers, you will see that the built environment is omnipresent in the lives of all of us because we spend, and I found that an intimidating number, 90% of our time in buildings.\nI would tend to think it is a good thing, but you might want to wish some people to be outside slightly more often than the remaining 10%.\n***\nThe industry has an enormous potential for contributing to Europe's green transition towards net zero in 2050. And as I'm sure you are aware, that is something we diligently work towards.\nHaving said that, currently, there is a substantial gap that we need to bridge between our 2030 climate targets and our objective to reach climate neutrality, which is only 20 years later.\nThe construction sector is absolutely critical and a key partner in this transition.\nWe are very grateful for the efforts that have been made and for the shared goals that we have.\nBecause we see climate action not only as necessary, but also as an opportunity, as an investment that will create a ripple effect for business opportunities.\nNew partnerships, standards, certifications, and talent will help create a strong business case for what we feel should be a resilient, adaptive, and effective construction sector.\nOur aim is and should continue to be to help you in achieving this.\n***\nFor that, it is also fair to acknowledge that the industry is not entirely, and that is an understatement, without environmental challenges.\nThe sector represents the biggest source of Europe's waste. It is also very resource intensive.\nAnd if current practices continue as usual, the renovation of buildings alone will have consumed almost 1.000 million tons of virgin materials from now until 2050.\nBuildings are responsible for roughly 40% of Europe's energy consumption.\nAnd therefore, we are not yet on track to meet the 55% emission reduction target by 2030.\nIn order to get there, we should reduce buildings' greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 60%.\n***\nThere is work to do, and I'm sure we are all on the same page there. That is why we also have the Fit for 55 package. Because in our view, it helps define a clear path for reducing emissions of buildings during their life cycle.\nThe revised ETS Directive is a key element in this framework.\nTogether with CBAM, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, it will lead to a strong reduction of emissions for key construction products, such as steel and cement.\nWith the extension to new sectors, around 75% of EU emissions in 2027 will be subject to carbon pricing. This makes ETS in general a truly crucial element to achieve our 2030 target.\nNew buildings will also have to be much more energy efficient and halt their dependency on fossil fuels.\nCurrently, two-thirds of the energy used for heating and cooling of buildings still comes from fossil fuels. So, we do have a challenge there.\nTherefore, and again that is then from 2030 onwards, renewable sources will have to be fully integrated into new building's energy requirements as we stipulated under the Zero-emission Buildings Directive.\nA lot is going on, but having said that, these initiatives will not be enough to reach net zero.\n***\nWe will also have to focus on construction strategies for carbon removal.\nPromoting the use of sustainably sourced bio-based materials and employing advanced construction techniques is therefore crucial. It will help us create energy-efficient buildings that serve as carbon sinks throughout their lifecycle.\nAnd throughout the EU Carbon Removal Certification Framework, building owners will also be able provide reliable and transparent evidence of their buildings' carbon storage capacity.\nThat is absolutely key; that we make sure that they are part of the alliance as well and that the data are reliable. Because that is one of the key challenges for going forward.\nThis initiative holds the promise of promoting the adoption of climate-friendly materials, of circularity in construction practices.\nAnd in our view, it should also provide economic opportunities. To society at large, but certainly also to your companies for monetising carbon storage in buildings through private and public support.\nThe New European Bauhaus offers an opportunity to empower the construction sector.\nIt encourages the application of advanced building techniques.\n***\nAnd yet at the same time I think it is fair to be realistic: we must not only make buildings climate neutral, there is also this huge endeavour that we have embarked on and that is making stuff more climate resilient.\nIn Europe, the reality simply is such that extreme weather circumstances have already increased, the impact is accelerated, and it will get worse before it gets better. We will see more adverse effects in the years going forward.\n2023 has been the hottest year on record, but it will not stop at that. Next to the task of making sure we do more in terms of mitigation, we need to do a lot more in terms of adaptation.\nMany of you will have seen the European Climate Risk Assessment which was published recently by the European Environment Agency. That provides the latest analysis. And frankly speaking if you go through the numbers, if you go through the probabilities, it is intimidating material.\nWe simply will see more catastrophes going forward and we need to make sure we get our people out of harm's way. And there as well the construction sector has in our view a pivotal role to play.\nJust to make it even worse, let me give you one more number. A conservative estimate is that the worsening climate impacts could reduce the GDP of Europe by the end of this century by 7%.  That sounds small. As a former finance minister, I know it is absolutely huge. Just to give you an idea: the COVID impact of the average European country in 2020 was roughly that number. It is absolutely huge what we would then lack in terms of resources, so more needs to be done.\nAdaptation to climate change for the built environment therefore requires what we feel should truly be a systemic approach.\nAnd therefore, the Commission in 2021 already published guidelines on climate-proofing infrastructures.\nAnd in 2023, we published guidance with best practice examples on how to adapt buildings to future climate conditions and step-by-step explanations.\n***\nTalking about future steps, we still need to do more to integrate the future climate into all standards that guide the planning, that guide the design and that guide the materials used in infrastructures and buildings.\nBecause after all, the building environment ensures that our society basically functions.\nIt also provides us with the space where we live.\nAnd this is where I feel adaptation and resilience policies actually join forces with the New European Bauhaus.\nWe both want to ensure that we can thrive in a safe home, and that we do so in harmony with the environment.\n***\nSo, we are almost at the moment we have been waiting for. The moment where we start the discussions on the topics of decarbonisation, of circularity. Handing over to the keynote speakers. Of course, also discussing competitiveness, access to EU and national funding.\nI'm very eager to listen to the speakers we have, leading us and guiding us through the conversation, but also to each and everyone around the table. So please speak up and make this an interactive dialogue. Once again, thank you very much for being here with us.",

        "title": "EU budget: Commission puts forward an adjusted package for the next generation of own resources",
        "date": "Jun 20, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "As committed during the negotiations on the long-term EU budget 2021-2027, the European Commission has today completed its proposal for a next generation of own resources. Today's package includes a new temporary statistical own resource based on company profits. Following the political agreement on the Fit For 55 package, which seeks to ensure EU policies contribute to the climate neutrality of our continent, the Commission  also proposes to adjust the own resources proposals based on the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) compared to the original proposals from December 2021.\nToday's proposal completes and updates the package for the next generation of own resources to the budgetput forward back in December 2021. Three sources of revenue were proposed back then: one based on revenues from emissions trading (ETS), one drawing on the resources generated by the proposed EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, and one based on the share of residual profits from multinationals that will be re-allocated to EU Member States under the recent OECD/G20 agreement on a re-allocation of taxing rights (“Pillar One”). This is completed today by a statistical own resource linked to the corporate sector. Once in force, this basket of new own resources will ensure an adequate long-term financing of the budget including the repayment of NextGenerationEU.\nEuropean CommissionPresident von der Leyensaid:\"Today's proposal completes our proposal for stable new own resources to finance the massive NextGenerationEU investments in EU recovery and resilience with four new own resources for the EU budget. Member States now have all the elements to come to a quick agreement and secure the funding for the EU budget.\"\nNew temporary statistical based own resource on company profits\nThe European Parliament, the Council and the Commission jointly agreed in 2020 that an own resource linked to the corporate sector should be proposed. The new statistical own resource based on company profits will be temporary, to be replaced by a possible contribution from Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT), once proposed and unanimously agreed by all Member States.\nIn the meantime, the own resource put forward today will be calculated as 0.5% of the notional EU company profit base, an indicator calculated by Eurostat on the basis of the national accounts statistics.\nIt is not a tax on companies, nor does it increase companies' compliance costs. It will be a national contribution paid by Member States based on the gross operating surplus for the sectors of financial and non-financial corporations, which would help to balance the basket of own resources and further diversify the revenue sources of the EU budget.\nThe statistical own resource on company profits would provide revenues as of 2024 of about €16 billion (2018 prices) per year.\nAdjustment of the ETS own resource\nFollowing the increase in the carbon price to about € 80 per tonne of CO2 in 2022 (from €55 in 2021), Member States revenues from the Emissions Trading System (ETS) have doubled in the course of two years to almost €30 billion in 2022. Prices are expected to remain well above €55 per tonne of CO2 in the years to come. As compared to its original proposal of December 2021, the Commission proposes to increase the call rate for the ETS-based own resource to 30% from all revenues generated by EU emissions trading, up from 25% originally proposed. This is expected to generate EU budget revenue of about €7 billion (in 2018 prices) annually from 2024 onwards. This is expected to increase to about €19 billion per year from 2028, when revenues from the new ETS will also enter into the EU budget. At the same time, annual revenues from ETS allocated to Member States could go above €46 billion, thus exceeding by far what was expected when the Fit for 55 proposal was tabled.\nAdjustment of the CBAM\nIn light of the Fit for 55 package, the Commission is also proposing a technical adjustment to the control framework of theCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), to align its original proposal for an own resource with the adopted text. This source of revenue is expected to generate about €1.5 billion per year as of 2028 for the EU budget.\nNext steps\nToday's proposal will feed into the negotiations with the Member States in the Council on a next generation of own resources of the budget.\nThe legislative discussions on the first proposal of December 2021 have made limited progress. While a second proposal for new own resources was originally due by 2024, the Commission decided to put it forward earlier, so that Member States have all the elements to engage in the negotiation in the framework of the agreed roadmap. The Commission calls on the Council to accelerate these negotiations.\nBackground\nThe EU budget is currently being financed via four own resources. Introducing new sources of revenue has been a long-standing ambition for EU-policy makers, as it would create the following benefits:\nFor More Information\nQ&A\nFactsheet\nLegal acts\nRevenue | European Commission (europa.eu)\nThe next generation of EU own resources (europa.eu)\nOwn resources (Europa.eu)",

        "title": "Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: Questions and Answers",
        "date": "Jul 14, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Why is the Commission proposing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism?\nThe EU is at the forefront of international efforts to fight climate change. The European Green Deal sets out a clear path towards realising the EU's ambitious target of a 55% reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to become a climate-neutral continent by 2050.\nThe July 2021 package in support of the EU's climate targets is an integral part of our strategy to achieve this, and will further seal the EU's reputation as a global climate leader. As part of these efforts, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a climate measure that should prevent the risk of carbon leakage and support the EU's increased ambition on climate mitigation, while ensuring WTO compatibility.\nClimate change is a global problem that needs global solutions. As we raise our own climate ambition and less stringent environmental and climate policies prevail in non-EU countries, there is a strong risk of so-called ‘carbon leakage' – i.e. companies based in the EU could move carbon-intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or EU products could be replaced by more carbon-intensive imports. Such carbon leakage can shift emissions outside of Europe and therefore seriously undermine EU and global climate efforts. The CBAM will equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports and ensure that the EU's climate objectives are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious policies.\nWhat is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism?\nDesigned in compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and other international obligations of the EU, the CBAM system will work as follows: EU importers  will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid, had the goods been produced under the EU's carbon pricing rules. Conversely, once a non-EU producer can show that they have already paid a price for the carbon used in the production of the imported goods in a third country, the corresponding cost can be fully deducted for the EU importer. The CBAM will help reduce the risk of carbon leakage by encouraging producers in non-EU countries to green their production processes.\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms are already in place in some regions around the world, such as California, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity. A number of countries such as Canada and Japan are planning similar initiatives. In addition, the IMF and the OECD have recently carried out work to study how such measures could support international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In thecommuniqué following their meeting of 9-10 July 2021, G20 Finance Ministers also mentioned the need for closer international coordination on the use of carbon pricing mechanisms.\nTo provide businesses and other countries with legal certainty and stability, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will be phased in gradually and will initially apply only to a selected number of goods at high risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity generation. A reporting system will apply as from 2023 for those products with the objective of facilitating a smooth roll out and to facilitate dialogue with third countries, and importers will start paying a financial adjustment in 2026.\nFinally, as a potential EU own resource, revenues from CBAM will contribute to the EU's budget, as laid out in the December 2020 Interinstitutional Agreement on budget and own resources.\nIsn't carbon leakage already addressed by the Emissions Trading System?\nThe EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the world's first international emissions trading scheme and the EU's flagship policy to combat climate change. It sets a cap on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be released from industrial installations in certain sectors. Allowances must be bought on the ETS trading market, though a certain number of free allowances is distributed to prevent carbon leakage. That system has been effective in addressing the risk of leakage but it also dampens the incentive to invest in greener production at home and abroad. The CBAM will progressively become an alternative to this. Under the Commission's new proposal for a revised ETS, however, the number of free allowances for all sectors will decline over time so that the ETS can have maximum impact in fulfilling our ambitious climate goals. Furthermore, for the CBAM sectors, the free allowances will gradually be phased out as from 2026.\nTo complement the ETS, the CBAM will be based on a system of certificates to cover the embedded emissions in products being subsequently imported into the EU. The CBAM departs from the ETS in some limited areas, however, in particular since it is not a ‘cap and trade' system. Instead, the CBAM certificates mirrors the ETS price.\nTo ensure a level playing field between EU and non-EU businesses, and once the full CBAM regime becomes operational in 2026, the system will adjust to reflect the revised EU ETS, in particular when it comes to the reduction of available free allowances in the sectors covered by the CBAM. This means that the CBAM will only begin to apply to the products covered gradually and in direct proportion to the reduction of free allowances allocated under the ETS for those sectors. Put simply, until they are completely phased out in 2035, the CBAM will apply only to the proportion of emissions that does not benefit from free allowances under the EU ETS, thus ensuring that importers are treated in an even-handed way compared to EU producers.\nHow will the CBAM work in practice?\nThe CBAM will mirror the ETS in the sense that the system is based on the purchase of certificates by importers. The price of the certificates will be calculated depending on the weekly average auction price of EU ETS allowances expressed in € / tonne of CO2 emitted. Importers of the goods will have to, either individually or through a representative, register with national authorities where they can also buy CBAM certificates.\nNational authorities will authorise registration of declarants in the CBAM system, as well as reviewing and verifying declarations. They will also be responsible for selling CBAM certificates to importers. In order to import goods covered under the CBAM into the EU, they must declare by 31 May each year the quantity of goods and the embedded emissions in those goods imported into the EU in the preceding year. At the same time, they must surrender the CBAM certificates they have purchased in advance from the authorities.\nBy ensuring importers pay the same carbon price as domestic producers under the EU ETS, CBAM will ensure equal treatment for products made in the EU and imports from elsewhere and avoid carbon leakage.\nWhat will happen in the transitional phase?\nUnder the Commission's proposal, importers will have to report emissions embedded in their goods without paying a financial adjustment in a transitional phase starting in 2023 and finishing at the end of 2025, giving time for the final system to be put in place.\nThis transitional phase, combined with the gradual phasing in of CBAM over time, will allow for a careful, predictable and proportionate transition for EU and non-EU businesses as well as authorities. Once the definitive system becomes fully operational in 2026, EU importers will have to declare annually the quantity of goods and the amount of embedded emissions in the total goods they imported into the EU in the preceding year, and surrender the corresponding amount of CBAM certificates.\nWhich sectors will the new mechanism cover and why were they chosen?\nThe CBAM will initially apply to imports of the following goods:\nThese sectors have a high risk of carbon leakage and high carbon emissions. The administrative feasibility of covering the sectors in the CBAM from the start was also taken into account.\nThe CBAM will apply to direct emissions of greenhouse gases emitted during the production process of the products covered. By the end of the transition period, the Commission will evaluate how the CBAM is working and whether to extend its scope to more products and services - including down the value chain, and whether to cover so-called ‘indirect' emissions (i.e. carbon emissions from the electricity used to produce the good).\nHow can EU importers ensure that they get the information they need from their non-EU exporters to be able to use the new system correctly?\nThe information on embedded emissions for goods subject to CBAM should be communicated to importers registered in the EU by their non-EU producers. In cases where this information is not available as the goods are being imported, EU importers will be able to use default values (even once the definitive system has kicked in) on CO2 emissions for each product to determine the number of certificates they need to purchase. Importers will nevertheless be able to demonstrate actual emissions during a reconciliation procedure, and surrender the appropriate number of CBAM certificates accordingly.\nWho will fall under the scope of the CBAM?\nIn principle, imports of goods from all non-EU countries will be covered by the CBAM. That said, certain third countries who participate in the ETS or have an emission trading system linked to the Union's will be excluded from the mechanism. This is the case for members of the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nCBAM will be applied to electricity generated in and imported from countries that wish to integrate their electricity markets with the EU until such a point that those electricity markets are fully integrated. At that point, and under strict conditions linked to their implementation of certain obligations and commitments, these countries could be exempted from the mechanism. If that is the case, the EU will revisit any exemptions granted in 2030, at which point those partners should have put in place the decarbonisation measures they have committed to, and an emissions trading system equivalent to the EU's.\nWho have you consulted on the proposed CBAM and how will you engage with third countries?\nIn preparing this proposal, the Commission consulted stakeholders widely, both through an open public consultation and more targeted consultations. In addition, the Commission engaged in extensive bilateral consultations with public authorities in EU and non-EU countries, business associations, individual companies and NGOs. Targeted consultations were also undertaken with senior managers and associations from the basic materials sectors, manufacturers, NGOs and policymakers.\nDialogue with third countries will continue in multilateral fora and bilateral relations. As CBAM aims to encourage cleaner production processes, the EU also stands ready to work with low and middle income countries towards the decarbonisation of their manufacturing industries. The Union will also support less developed countries with the necessary technical assistance.\nTo provide businesses and other countries with legal certainty and stability, the CBAM will be phased in gradually and will initially apply only to a selected number of goods at high risk of carbon leakage.\nFor More Information\nCommunication: fit for 55 delivering EU's 2030 climate targets\nWebsite Delivering the European Green Deal(including legislative proposals)\nWebsite with Audio-visual material on the proposals\nPress release: European Green Deal: Commission proposes transformation of EU economy and society to meet climate ambitions\nQ&A on the Revision of the Energy Taxation Directive\nQ&A on EU Emissions Trading System\nQ&A on The Effort sharing and Land-use, Forestry and Agriculture Regulations\nQ&A on Making our Energy Systems fit for our Climate Targets\nQ&A on Sustainable Transport Infrastructure and Fuels\nArchitecture of the package Factsheet\nSocially fair transition Factsheet\nNature and Forests Factsheet\nTransport Factsheet\nEnergy Factsheet\nBuildings Factsheet\nIndustry Factsheet\nHydrogen Factsheet\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Factsheet\nMaking Energy Taxation Greener Factsheet\nBrochure on Delivering the European Green Deal",

        "title": "Opening Remarks EVP Timmermans on Fit for 55 at the Environment Council",
        "date": "Jun 28, 2022",
        "location": "Luxembourg",
        "text": "Dear ministers,\nI cannot overemphasize the importance of our gathering today. It's a year ago that the Climate Law was adopted. We knew at the time that the Climate Law is just a framework. If we want to abide by the Climate Law, we have to have a plan that will get us to at least 55% reduction by 2030. Fit for 55 is exactly that.\nNow, when the Climate Law was adopted, we were in a different world. Our world has changed on the 24th of February of this year.If anybody needed to be reminded of what we're faced with, you just have to look at what happened yesterday in Kremenchuk, where another proof of the depravity of the Putin regime was given when he attacked a shopping mall, killing innocent people once again. This is the challenge we are faced with. And this challenge goes beyond the wish of Putin to occupy a democratic European country that is his neighbour.\nHe also has a wish to destroy our way of life, our values, our society, because he has an alternative vision.I think it is crucial that we understand that for the strength of our society, for the strength of our values, the strength of how Europeans want to live, we need to address the climate crisis with as much force and unity as we address the Russian aggression. This issue cannot divide us. Because division in Europe is what Putin is looking for. He's looking for the weaknesses. He's looking for the divisions and if you can find them here, you will certainly use them.\nSo, the one lesson we've learned from the last couple of months, is thatthe first thing we need to do is to rid ourselves of the dependency on Russian fossil fuels. To do that we need to do it in a consistent and future proof way. Fit for 55 gets into that direction. We will later also discuss REPowerEU that will help us achieve that goal. So that is why I believe today's meeting is crucial.\nOur task is also clear. We have it in our hands to agree on the last missing pieces. You know this has always been a tripod: CBAM: adopted, common position. The energy files: adopted yesterday, and congratulations to the French presidency for achieving that yesterday, it is a historic decision. And this is the third leg of the tripod, and a tripod cannot stand on two legs. So if we fail today, we not only you know push into the long grass, everything that needs to be done for Fit for 55. we also really undermine what was decided yesterday. They cannot be disassociated these two decisions, and also CBAM. A tripod needs three legs and the third leg needs to be hopefully decided today.\nNow, the Slovenian presidency has done a tremendous amount of work and the French presidency has done amazing, amazing work in the last months. They worked so hard to find compromises, the minister has just explained them to us.And I believe that although nobody around this table will be entirely happy with every element of what the French presidency has proposed, it seems to me to be a balanced compromise that could to a large extent be embraced. And also, I think what the minister has just exposed is a clear and honest reflection of the discussions. I think everybody will recognize that what she has presented reflects the discussions around the table that have been going on for months now.\nObviously, many of the proposals today will be looked at in detail but I want to give you the reassurance of the Commission thatthe compromise text will, as a package, deliver what we need to deliver legally which is at least 55% reduction by 2030. So, we need to use today and to find the balance everybody can live with. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm absolutely convinced that we can do it.\nIf we don't deliver today,ambition not delivered is nothing at all. It doesn't bring the change on the ground that we need and want to happen. And again, I stress some of you will be unhappy with parts of the package, but I urge you to look at it in its entirety. It's balanced, it's consistent and it is fair. We need to have a transition that is aligned with the climate law and leaves no one behind. It protects them and also that gives us the strength to prove to Putin that whatever he tries, he will not divide us. He will not weaken us and we will prevail and our values and our way of life will prevail.\nThank you.",

        "date": "Dec 20, 2021",
        "location": "no location found",
        "text": "Opening remarks\nThank you very much Andrej.\nThe operational word here is brief, and I will be very brief. Now that we have put the final elements of the Fit for 55 package on the table last week, it can be discussed in its full context.\nFirst of all, I want to thank you Andrej and your team, for getting us up to speed in the last 6 months. The Slovenian Presidency has done an excellent job in getting all the formations of the Council into the right direction with this Fit for 55 package. You have set the scene for the French presidency now to pick it up and take it further. Because the task we are faced with is quite daunting.\nAll the proposals that have been on the table have been analysed in quite some detail. We've also looked at the interlinkages, and a number of open questions have been clarified.\nNow, we have to shift gears. I won't stop saying that in the climate crisis we have no time to lose. In the coming months, it will be essential that you carve out your respective positions.\nThe French presidency, with the progress reports, will have an excellent basis to take the work forward, and we can also start the negotiations from day one.\nThe Commission will of course support this process as much as we can. We are ready to intensify the discussions and to help the Council to form its full negotiation position on all files of the package within the first half of next year.\nWe know that devising a position on this comprehensive package of interlinked but also different proposals is not an easy task. I know this full well because we had the same challenge within the Commission before we could put the proposal on the table.\nOf course, the time will never be ‘just right'; there is always one more detail to discuss. It ultimately comes down to the question whether the essential political questions can be solved, and on the right distribution of ambition and efforts across the different proposals, sectors, and between Member States to deliver on our agreed target.\nBecause that's the basis. The basis is the Climate Law that compels us to reach at least 55% reduction of emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. All the discussions of the proposals should not lose track of the fact that this is a legal obligation on all of us.\nI also know that the European Parliament intends to move quite fast on all of this. So, I think we should be in a good position to start the inter-institutional negotiations right at the beginning of the second semester next year.\nFinal word I wanted to say, and this might be self-evident, but I have to repeat it every time. This transition will be just or there will just be no transition. We have to make sure that solidarity is operationalised between Member States, within Member States, between sectors, within sectors. I think this is probably the biggest challenge we will be facing, certainly in this time, with high energy prices and other challenges that all of our societies face.\nThank you.\nClosing remarks\nWe've been taking careful note of what was said. First of all, let me say that the reason why the European Union is seen as world leader in this area is because we have set our goals into law for 2030 and 2050, which is a compelling thing.\nSecondly, that we have translated that commitment into concrete measures and come up with a comprehensive package that has taxations as a method, that has regulation as a method, and that lets the market do a lot of the work. On this last point, I want to insist that this is something that has proven to be extremely effective in industry.\nThe emissions trading system, I would argue, is one of the best instruments we have to influence behaviour. It's an instrument industry is now familiar with and it's an instrument that can be used in industry and expanded in industry, like maritime and aviation, over the years. Yes, we have to be careful that when we introduce CBAM that we gradually reduce free allocations, but to have permanently both CBAM and free allocations without limitation does not make any sense, because free allocations are sort of the pre-CBAM measure to avoid carbon leakage.\nSo, it's going to be gradual, but we have to face the fact that these things are going to be phased-in, and phased-out if we need. On CBAM, CBAM is already working. It's already working because it is influencing behaviour of our international partners. Because all industrialized nations that will put a price on carbon will have to take measures to avoid carbon leakage, and CBAM is that measure for the European Union and it is being followed by many others.\nI have really taken good note of the fact that there are divergent views in this Council on the new ETS for buildings and road transport. I believe it is an essential element of the package. Because if you look at where emissions are still going up it's in transport, and we need to do something there. If you look at the energy performance of buildings, the reduction of the energy use is only half of what we need to have to achieve our goals. So we need to do something there.\nAfter having studied all possibilities, the Commission came up with this as a method that has worked elsewhere, and that will allow us with the revenues to compensate our citizens at risk of energy poverty, or to help them make this transition possible. But once again, the Commission is open for alternatives that could get us there, but keep in mind that these alternatives still will have to get us to the 2030 target and the 2050 target. We will gladly discuss that with you. But, I would caution against dismissing the market instruments here, because they do actually work quite well as we see in industry.\nNow, whatever instruments we use, we have to be very much aware that this is such a fundamental transition in our society. This is tectonic. This is revolutionary. This is not just 1-2-3 steps in a different direction. If we indeed want our citizens to be part of that, we have to prove to them from the start, not afterwards, that this is going to be just and that we will act to prevent people ending in energy poverty. That we will act to prevent huge gaps emerging within society.\nThat's why, and let me end on that. That's why I want to insist on the fact that with all the elements that we bring to the table, whether it's the Effort Sharing Regulation, whether it's all the other elements that we mentioned, whether it's CO2 on cars, etc., the onus will be on us to prove that this is a just transition and that we leave no one behind. I think that's the only way forward, and that relates to the relationship within the EU between Member States, but it also relates to the relationship within Member States between our citizens, also within industries, within regions.\nJust transition as a case in point. Coal is on its way out. But the way we help coal mining regions transit into the opportunities of a new economy, will have an enormous effect on how society at large perceives our ability to mobilise a just transition. So this is the spirit with which, I hope, we can work on this package in the year to come.\nI'm absolutely confident that on many issues we can advance. Even in these very difficult times, with high energy prices, we do understand the best answer to high energy prices is to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. So the faster we make the transition to renewables, the faster we are not dependent on external fossil fuels providers, and the faster we are not victims of a fossil fuel market.\nSo let's convince all our citizens that we're acting in their interest when we speed up our transition to a sustainable society. To a society that can rely more and more on renewable energy that has the potential to replace many of our necessities of fossil fuels.\nThank you very much.",

        "title": "The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism starts applying in its transitional phase as of 1 October: Commission consults on reporting obligations",
        "date": "Jun 13, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The European Commission published todaya first call for feedbackon the rules governing the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) during its transitional phase, which starts on 1 October of this year and runs until the end of 2025. The draft Implementing Regulation published today details the reporting obligations and information sought from EU importers of CBAM goods, as well as the provisional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of CBAM goods.\nIn the CBAM's transitional phase, traders will only have to report on the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism without paying any financial adjustment. This will give time for businesses to prepare and will provide the necessary information to fine-tune the definitive methodology by 2026.\nThe draft Implementing Regulation provides for some flexibility when it comes to the values used to calculate embedded emissions on imports. During the first year of implementation, companies will have the choice of reporting in three ways: (a) full reporting according to the new methodology (EU method); (b) reporting based on equivalent third country national systems; and (c) reporting based on reference values. As of 1 January 2025, only the EU method will be accepted.\nThis gradual approach will give producers time to adapt in a predictable manner. The Commission is also developing dedicated IT tools to help importers perform and report these calculations, as well as in-depth guidance, training materials and tutorials to support businesses when the transitional mechanism begins. While importers will be asked to collect fourth quarter data as of 1 October 2023, their first report will only have to be submitted by the end of January 2024.\nIn a fully transparent process, the Commission informally consulted anExpert Groupwith the full involvement of third countries, stakeholders and industry while preparing the reporting obligations.\nThe public consultation can be foundonlineand feedback is welcome from business, academia, civil society and the general public until 11 July. Stakeholders are asked to focus their feedback on the specific implementing rules contained in the draft legislation, rather than on the CBAM Regulation itself.\nNext steps\nThe Implementing Regulation will be formally adopted by the Commission later this summer after a vote in the CBAM Committee, composed of representatives from EU Member States.\nBackground\nAs one of the key policies in the EU's ambitious fight against climate change agenda,  CBAM is an essential pillar of theFit for 55 Packageand is the EU's landmark tool to fight carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs when companies based in the EU move carbon-intensive production abroad to take advantage of lax standards, or when EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.\nAs an environmental policy measure, CBAM complements and reinforces the existing carbon pricing mechanism in the EU established in 2005 with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) Directive, by reflecting its effects on imports. More specifically, CBAM targets energy-intensive companies exporting specific goods to the EU. This green measure does not apply to countries but to companies which it encourages to decarbonise. CBAM represents an opportunity for third country producers to develop climate policies and methodologies, as it is designed to take all decarbonisation efforts into account. Because the same carbon price is being applied to both EU and non-EU producers, the CBAM does not discriminate among products or countries and fully supports third-country producers' path towards decarbonisation.\nThe purpose of the transitional period is to collect data that will help fine-tune the shape of CBAM in view of its definitive phase from 2026. To this end, the Commission will prepare a report to the European Parliament and to the Council and will, if appropriate, make a proposal to modify the regulation by mid-2025. In any case, a new methodology for the definitive phase will be developed in 2025 in another Implementing Regulation that will also be published for feedback.\nThe present consultation is the first opportunity to ‘have your say'on the transitional implementation of CBAM. During the transitional period, the Commission will also publish calls for feedback on the 13 other pieces of secondary legislation (implementing and delegated acts) to be put in place before CBAM becomes operational in its definitive phase on 1 January 2026.\nMore information on CBAM can be foundhere.",

        "date": "Nov 10, 2021",
        "location": "no location found",
        "text": "It is a pleasure to talk about this issue. It's not the first time I talk about the issue because it's one of the most debated issues in the international scene over the last year and a half - two years. If we are going to do what we promised, or what we're legally obliged to do, the European Union which is to reach climate neutrality in 2050, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, we need to really change many of our policies. But at the end, the core of any policy to decarbonise your economy is to put a price on carbon.\nSo one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to bring down emissions in Europe is our Emissions Trading System. The principle is very simple as you know, we put a price on CO2 emissions, we create a strong price signal for green investments, and we spur the markets to develop cost-efficient solutions. At the same time, the revenues generated by the system can be used to address social impacts, or to finance innovation.\nWe know that carbon pricing works. The system currently covers 45% of all EU emissions and applies to around 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as to over 500 airlines. Since its introduction in 2005, emissions from the ETS sectors have been cut by around 43%. Some of us will remember that when we voted the ETS system back then there was a lot of resistance. In initial years there was a lot of scepticism, even a lot of criticism; it didn't work, the price was too low. But I don't think that applies any longer.\nI think it's making school, because besides the European system, Canada, China also, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, and parts of the United States are either operating or developing their own systems. Under the Green Deal we want to revise and strengthen the system, we will also want to extend it to new sectors because ETS has proven itself to be effective as a tool for reducing emissions and in some non-ETS sectors we've not had the same level of success so far. Just to mention transport where emissions are still going up instead of down.\nWe will apply a new Emissions Trading System domestically for road transport and building fuels, as we need to make emissions cuts in those areas. Let me be very clear, especially in the presence of members of the European Parliament also, we believe this system could work. The goal is to reduce emissions and to create more energy efficient buildings. If there are alternatives that will lead to the same result, we will certainly study them, we are not tying our fate to an ETS system, but in all our analyses the ETS system gives us the best result and gives us the best opportunity to compensate our citizens for potentially higher energy prices. Potentially I say because the onus will be on the producers of the energy first and foremost. And to avoid the trap of energy poverty.\nI believe, especially with the creation of the Climate Social Fund. We made a proposal, I know that in the European Parliament there are differing views on whether it's enough or not, whether it should be bigger or different. That's all up for debate. But the principle I think stands that if you create an energy transition, you have to make sure this is a just transition that you leave no one behind, and that we understand that certain groups in society will be more vulnerable than others. We need to address that vulnerability and make sure it doesn't happen.\nWe also made on the 14th of July, a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. Of course, we want global action, but we believe that in the International Maritime Organization not enough was achieved over the last periods and we need to achieve more and do a lot better. I hope, and I see the momentum here at COP, I hope that the IMO and other international organizations also in aviation understand the time is now to change their attitude and to work towards putting a fair price on carbon to decarbonize their industry.\nBy taking responsibility for half of the emissions from extra-EU voyages, the EU would take responsibility for its fair share of shipping emissions. I would encourage third countries to decide an appropriate action to address their share of emissions. That's the other 50%. Or to support the development of appropriate global pricing schemes.\nI believe putting a price on carbon and having a thorough discussion with the maritime sector. Some of the dirtiest stuff available on Earth is burnt by ships, to keep them going. Whereas there are alternatives, you can with renewables, you can. The first projects are very promising, that you can use for instance ammonia, green ammonia, to power shipping, these are the things we need to work for. And by putting a price on carbon you make the business case for alternative fuels more interesting.\nSo, one of the key priorities we have identified in our sustainable and smart mobility strategy, is to advance discussions on mid-and long term measures to ensure the swift implementation of the International Maritime Organisation's initial greenhouse gas strategy.\nNow, on aviation I want to say a few things. We need a stronger contribution from the aviation sector to reach our climate targets. Aviation emissions in Europe increased an average of 5% year on year between 2013 and 2018. That's 5% every year. While there has been a recent reduction in air traffic, but that's completely COVID related and not because of different policies. Because now emissions are projected to grow again. So we have a serious challenge. That's why we propose to revise the ETS aviation rules to create an effective pricing to ensure that the sector contributes its fair share\nFlights within the European Economic Area, as well as flights to Switzerland and the UK, will continue to be covered by the EU ETS. The total number of aviation allowances in the ETS will be capped at current levels, and be reduced annually by 4.2%. Well there's many other things we need to do, but I want to move quickly to CBAM because that was also something that Pascal announced.\nNow if you put a price on carbon, and that's what everybody who is going to decarbonise is going to do, you run the risk of carbon leakage. It's as simple as one and one is two. So all nations moving in that direction will be faced with the potential of carbon leakage. This is something we need to prevent, and the only reason for CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage.\nWe want it to be in conformity with WTO rules. We want it to address this issue directly. We will use a trial period of two years where we see what the effect is in five sectors: cement, fertilizer, steel, aluminium and electricity. And we will see what happens globally. Now, if a Turkish minister recently said, one of the reasons why Turkey decided to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement is because we don't want CBAM to affect our trade with the EU, then CBM is already working even before it's been introduced. If I talk to partners who initially said we don't like CBAM, and I ask the question, but what about your carbon leakage risk? They all acknowledge your have it and they will need to find ways of addressing it.\nMy point is this, and I said it also when I travelled to India and Indonesia, if we all move in the direction of decarbonising our economy, of moving towards net zero, then we will all need to take comparable measures. Then the risk that CBAM will be applied in trade is lower, unless this risk can be manifestly demonstrated. And if we do that, then I think we can introduce a system that is in conformity with WTO rules.\nI have to say the last couple of days and speaking to many, many countries here, that logic now is widely understood. It's not always liked but it's understood. I think it's undeniable that the issue of carbon leakage will have to be addressed for decarbonising efforts to actually be successful. So, this is what I had to say on CBAM.\nI hope we can continue our dialogue, and I'm actually quite confident that we will increasingly create a space across the planet where countries take comparable measures to decarbonise our economy, which would make the introduction of CBAM not necessary, or only in a very limited way.\nThank you very much Pascal.",

        "title": "The next generation of EU own resources: Questions and Answers",
        "date": "Dec 22, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "OVERVIEW\nHow does the own resources system work today?\nThere are currently four own resources for the EU budget:\nThese four own resources account for more than 90% of revenues. Other sources of revenues include taxes and other deductions from EU staff salaries, bank interest, contributions from non-EU countries to certain programmes, interest on late payments and fines.\nWhy is the Commission proposing new own resources?\nFollowing the unprecedented economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU agreed on NextGenerationEU, the largest stimulus package ever financed through the EU budget. NextGenerationEU currently deploys more than €800 billion (in current prices, €750 billion in constant 2018 prices), raised on capital markets, to fund specific recovery and resilience actions in a limited period of time, in order to boost economic growth and invest in a greener and more digital future.\nOn 16 December 2020 the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed to accompany NextGenerationEU with a roadmap to introduce new own resources. The three institutions agreed that 'the expenditure from the Union budget related to the repayment of the European Union Recovery Instrument should not lead to an undue reduction in programme expenditure or investment instruments under the Multiannual Financial Framework' and that 'the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the repayment.'\nWhat is the composition of the Own Resources package?\nThe European Commission proposes an amendment of the Own Resources Decision to introduce three new categories of own resources based on:\nHow much revenue will the package deliver?\nAccording to the Commission's proposal, the new own resources will be introduced gradually as of 1 January 2023. Once they have reached their cruising speed, on average over the period 2026-2030, revenues for the EU budget are estimated to reach up to €17 billion per year (in constant 2018 prices). These revenues will be used for both the repayment of NextGenerationEU and the financing of the Social Climate Fund. These estimates are subject to uncertainties, in particular due to the market price for carbon allowances over time and the need to work on the finalisation and subsequent implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Pillar One.\nHow will the new own resources contribute to the repayment of NextGenerationEU?\nThe repayment of the borrowing for NextGenerationEU will be spread over more than three decades, to be concluded by 2058. Sufficient revenue is needed to cover the Union's repayment needs for the non-repayable part of the borrowing, in line with the funding structure and repayment profile of NextGenerationEU. An amount of €15-16 billion in current prices corresponds to a linear repayment profile from the Union budget for non-repayable support based on the Commission's issuance planning for NextGenerationEU, including the maturity structure.\nThe three institutions have agreed that new own resources should raise an amount that is sufficient to cover the expected expenditure for the repayment of the principal and the interest of the funds borrowed under NextGenerationEU. However, repayments will ultimately be financed through the general budget as there is no ‘earmarking' of own resources in line with the universality principle of the EU budget.\nNew own resources could enable repayment of NextGenerationEU borrowing already under the current multiannual financial framework. To that end, the Commission is putting forward a proposal for a targeted revision of the current multiannual financial framework, which would enable accommodating repayment of NextGenerationEU borrowing upon the introduction of new own resources.\nIs the Commission proposing EU taxes with this package?\nThe Commission does not propose EU taxes with the amendment of the Own Resources Decision. The Emissions Trading System and the carbon border adjustment mechanism are market-based instruments; their ancillary effect is the creation of new revenue for Member States. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement tackles tax avoidance and aims at ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activity and value creation occur. A future EU Directive on the reallocation of taxing rights will support implementing the international agreement in line with requirements of the EU Single market. These instruments have their own merits. The purpose of the revision of the Own Resource Decision is to allocate a share of the revenues generated by these instruments to the EU budget.\nHow will the EU collect the own resources?\nThe modalities for the making available and for the control and supervision of the own resources are defined in separate legal acts. The Commission will make the relevant proposals in the first half of 2022.\nHow do the proposals today relate to the Fit for 55 package?\nThe proposed own resources are consistent with and complementary to the Fit for 55 package. The latter is a set of several legislative proposals aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.\nEmissions trading and the carbon border adjustment mechanism aim at achieving environmental objectives. It is appropriate that a share of their revenues is allocated to the EU budget, because they are pan-European mechanisms based on European objectives and principles.\nFurthermore, the EU budget – including NextGenerationEU – strongly contributes to financing the transition to a climate-neutral economy. In particular, a new Social Climate Fund will provide dedicated funding to investments in renovation, new heating and cooling systems, and cleaner mobility. The Social Climate Fund will be financed by the EU budget with a financial envelope of €72.2 billion in current prices (corresponding to €58.4 billion in 2018 prices) over the period 2025-2032. The total financial envelope of the Fund would in principle correspond to an amount equivalent to around 25% of the expected revenue from the new emissions trading system for buildings and road transport.\nWhat does the Commission's proposal mean for Member States?\nThe Commission proposal achieves a good balance between the different needs and priorities of Member States:\nThe package preserves the fiscal sovereignty of Member States. The Commission does not propose new taxes. On the contrary, only a share of the revenues generated by these EU instruments are channelled to the EU budget.\nAt the same time, the package addresses fairness with the solidarity adjustment mechanism. Furthermore, the new own resources contribute to financing the Social Climate Fund which will address the social impacts of the transition to a low carbon economy. New sources of revenues are therefore indispensable for the adoption of the overall ‘Fit for 55' package.\nLast, new own resource are indispensable in the long term to maintain a sizable EU budget which will remain capable of financing, in addition to existing traditional policies, priorities such as research and investment, space and migration.\nEmissions Trading System own resource\nHow will the proposed emissions trading own resource work?\nThe Emissions Trading System is a pan-European instrument, which generates revenues for Member States. Today, this mechanism applies to the power generation and industrial sectors, as well as aviation within Europe. With the Fit for 55 package, it will be progressively extended to the maritime sector, while gradually by 2026 all aviation allowances will be auctioned. Moreover, the revision of the Emissions Trading Directive foresees a new Emissions Trading System covering road transport and buildings.\nThe Commission proposes that a limited share of the total revenues from most of the auctioning of emission allowances and allowances not auctioned for which Member State have some discretionary flexibilities becomes part of the EU budget.\nThe Commission also proposes a temporary solidarity adjustment mechanism to avoid an excessively regressive impact on contributions from the emissions trading for some Member States. This mechanism will notably limit the contribution from low-income and carbon-intensive Member States – and make sure that higher-income Member States with a low carbon intensity pay a fair contribution.\nWhy should revenues from emissions trading become own resources?\nThe Emissions Trading System is a pan-European climate instrument, also generating revenues. Installations and aircrafts already covered by the system are subject to the same rules across the EU. There is a single carbon price across the EU for the sectors covered. Similarly, the new Emissions Trading System for building and road transport will apply across the EU. It is therefore appropriate that a limited share of the revenues from the Emissions Trading System is transferred to the EU budget.\nHow will the solidarity adjustment mechanism for the ETS own resource work?\nWith the new solidarity mechanism applied to the ETS based own resource, the contribution share of lower income Member State should be limited to one and a half time their share in EU Gross National Income (GNI). Similarly, to ensure that all Member States pay a fair share, the share of the ETS own resource should not be disproportionate to the relative prosperity of Member States.\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanismown resource\nHow will the carbon border adjustment mechanism own resource work?\nWith the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 and the ambition to cut more rapidly European emissions by 2030, the EU needs to implement higher reduction targets in the coming decades. To ensure that the EU's effort is not frustrated by carbon leakage, a carbon border adjustment mechanism will be put in place in a way that is compatible with the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It will apply to iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity in a first phase.\nThe carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will ensure that products imported from outside the EU incur costs for their CO2 emissions aligned with EU products that are currently subject to the EU Emissions Trading System. Importers will need to acquire a sufficient amount of certificates to cover the embedded emissions of their imported goods. This means imported goods should be priced, as if they had been produced in the EU. In case those goods have paid a carbon price at the origin, this will be deducted to avoid double cost. Such a mechanism promotes cleaner industries in non-EU countries, encourages third countries to introduce carbon pricing measures and ensures fairness for EU companies.\n75% of the revenues stemming from the sale of these certificates will be transferred to the EU budget. Member States will consequently be able to retain 25% of the revenues generated by the sale of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism certificates. The CBAM will start to generate revenues after a transitional period (2023-2025).\nWhy should revenues from the carbon border adjustment mechanism become an own resource?\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism addresses the risk of carbon leakage and supports the EU's increased ambition on climate mitigation. It is compatible with WTO.\nDue to the pan European nature of this instrument, it is appropriate that the relevant revenues accrue to the EU budget as an own resource.\nOwn resource based on the reallocated profits of very large multinational companies\nHow will the own resource based on OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Pillar One work?\nPillar One of the OECD/G20 agreement envisages a reallocation of profits of multinational companies, from a number of sectors, with a consolidated global turnover of at least €20 billion and pre-tax profit margin above 10% based on the concept of end market jurisdictions where goods or services are used or consumed. Member States will provide a contribution proportional to the taxable reallocated profits.\nAlthough all the details of the implementation of Pillar One of the international corporate taxation reform are not settled yet, the own-resources-proposal of 22 December 2021 demonstrates the Commission's commitment to ensure that this OECD/G20 agreement is swiftly and successfully implemented. Its use as a basis for an EU own resource can further contribute to the repayment of NextGenerationEU.\nThe Commission has committed to propose a Directive in 2022 implementing this agreement in line with the requirements of the single market. The own resource will enter into force once this Directive should be transposed into national law subject to the ratification and effective application of the tax reform by international partners.\nRevision of the MFF\nWhy is the Commission proposing to amend the MFF regulation 2021-27?\nThe Commission is proposing a targeted revision of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 of 17 December 2020 establishing the 2021-2027 MFF for the following purposes:\nWhy does the Commission propose to increase the MFF ceilings for the Social Climate Fund?\nThe Commission proposed on 14 July a new financing instrument for the period 2025-2032: the Social Climate Fund, with an overall financial envelope of €72.2 billion in current prices, of which €23.7 billion (in current prices) for 2025-2027.\nA corresponding increase of the relevant 2021-2027 MFF expenditure ceilings (which are expressed in 2018 prices) for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027 is necessary to finance the related expenditure for the new Fund. It is thus proposed to increase the ceilings by €20.9 billion (2018 prices), which corresponds to the envelope of €23.7 billion in current prices proposed in July 2021.\nIn line with the Fund's objectives to alleviate the effects of the new emissions trading for buildings and road transport on vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users, the Fund is frontloaded to 2025, to enable Member States to anticipate the effects of the extension.\nFor the period 2025-2032, the Fund will be financed by general revenue under the Union budget, which will include as of 2026 the revenues from the emissions trading for buildings and road transport as foreseen in the amendment to the Own Resources Decision.\nFor More Information\nPress release\nFactsheets\nLegal acts\nRevenue | European Commission (europa.eu)",

        "date": "May 18, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "See also IP/21/2430\nWhy has the European Commission adopted a Communication on Business Taxation for the 21st century?\nThe EU needs a robust, efficient and fair business tax framework that supports the post-COVID-19 recovery, removes obstacles to cross-border investment in the Single Market and creates an environment conducive to fair and sustainable growth.\nToday's Communication sets out both a long-term vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and EU tax system, as well as a tax agenda for the next two years, with targeted measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. This agenda complements the ongoing work on international corporate tax reform, and provides solutions to the most pressing problems for the EU in business taxation, while also supporting the green and digital transitions.\nWhat are the main problems this Communication addresses?\nIt is already clear that our economies and societies  are being shaped by ongoing major trends:\nWhat will the Commission propose to tackle these issues?\nIn the long-term, today's Communication  presents a plan for a new framework for business taxation in the EU, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax obstacles and foster a more business-friendly environment in the Single Market. The “Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” (or BEFIT)will provide a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU, based on apportionment and a common tax base. BEFIT is an important Single Market initiative. It aims to cut red tape, reduce compliance costs, reduce tax avoidance opportunities and support jobs, growth and investment in the Single Market. This new proposal will replace the pending proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which will be withdrawn.\nFor the short term, the Communication also sets out a series of targeted initiatives to address current problems in business taxation and create a more stable, supportive and fair corporate tax framework for the future. The Commission will propose to:\nHow does this EU business tax agenda fit with the G20/OECD discussions on international tax reform?\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on a global consensus-based solution to reform the international corporate tax framework. The discussion focuses on two broad work streams: Pillar 1 (partial re-allocation of taxing rights) and Pillar 2 (minimum effective taxation of multinationals' profits).\nPillar 1 aims to adapt the international rules on the taxation of corporate profits, to reflect the changing nature of business models, including the ability of companies to do business without a physical presence. Pillar 2 focuses on remaining challenges linked to base erosion and profit shifting, and will set a floor to excessive tax competition. It aims to ensure that multinational businesses are subject to a minimum effective level of tax on all of their profits each year, regardless of where they are based. Once there is a consensus-based global agreement on both Pillars, the Commission will move swiftly to propose measures for their implementation in the EU, in line with the EU's tax agenda and the needs of the Single Market.\nThe international tax reform at OECD-level is complementary to the EU's tax agenda, which offers solutions that Europe needs in order to support its Single Market and accelerate the post-COVID-19 recovery.\nHow does the Communication on Business Taxation for the 21st century fit into the wider EU tax policy agenda?\nToday's Communication is part of a comprehensive and ambitious EU tax agenda for the coming years. Next to the much-needed reform of business taxation, a balanced tax mix for the 21stcentury requires less reliance on labour taxes, a more targeted and efficient use of VAT and an increased use of behavioural taxes. In the context of the European Green Deal, the Commission will make proposals, such as the review of the Energy Taxation Directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), to ensure that taxation and other pricing instruments support the EU's objective of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 and becoming climate neutral by 2050. A review of tobacco taxation will also help contribute to another important priority, public health. This multi-faceted approach to reforming taxation in the EU aims to make taxation fairer, greener and fitter for the modern economy, and contribute to Europe's long-term, sustainable growth.\nDoes the Communication cover digital taxation?\nNo. However, as mentioned above, if there is a consensus-based global agreement in the OECD on taxation, the Commission will move swiftly to propose measures for its implementation in the EU, in line with the EU's tax agenda and the needs of the Single Market. In addition, the Commission has been mandated by the European Council to deliver a digital levy, which should also serve as an EU own resource. The Commission is currently analysing different options and working on a design that does not undermine or impede the G20/OECD discussions.\nWhat is the timing for the upcoming proposals?\nText of the Communication\nPress release\nFactsheet\nPackage for Fair and Simple Taxation",

        "date": "Feb 27, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Following the adoption by College of Commissioners of the newClean Industrial Deal, President Ursulavon der Leyenwas in Antwerp to present the details of the plan to EU business leaders gathered at theEuropean Industry Summit.\nThe President made the case for Europe's industrial potential, highlighting its current strengths: one quarter of global clean tech patents, top-quality infrastructure, vibrant sectors such as hydrogen and electrolysers, and all while greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector continue to decrease.\nPresidentvon der Leyenwent on to lay out the details of the Clean Industrial Deal and other the accompanying initiatives adopted by the Commission on the same day.\nFirst, she said, thanks to Deal there will bemore investment on innovation:“Europe is a frontrunner for example in the global race for clean tech. Here in Europe, we have 30% of all innovative companies in electrolyser technologies worldwide; we have 20% for carbon capture and storage; and even 40% for wind and heat pump technology. But I know that too often, these companies struggle to grow, and to bring their solutions to industrial scale,”she said.\nBuilding on the success of theInnovation Fund, the Commission aims to mobiliseup to €100 billion to establish a Decarbonisation Bankwith a market-based system that rewards the most innovative and competitive companies. The President also said that the financing would come from theEU Emission Trading Systemin a direct reply to calls from businesses:“You said: This money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. That is exactly what we are doing now.”\nPresidentvon der Leyenalso talked about the important role thatcircularitycan play in growing the European economy and how the Clean Industrial Deal will promote it. She pointed out that 50% of the EU's steel, iron, zinc, and platinum come from scrap but much more could be used.\nFor example, she said thatend-of-life batteries could provide 15% of the lithium needed in Europe, enough to produce two million batteries for electric vehicles.\nThat is why the Clean Industrial Deal announces that the Commission will put forward aCircular Economy Act.“We have to keep critical raw materials waste in Europe and give it new life. This is not only good for the planet, it also supports our open strategic autonomy,”the President said.\nAnother pillar of the Commission's plan for industry is the ambitioussimplification packageadopted yesterday together with the Deal. The Commission has proposed tocut reporting obligations for most companieson corporate sustainability and mandatory taxonomy. Similarly, many SMEs will receive a simplify treatment in the application of due diligence rules and CBAM.\nThe President explained:“Around 80% of the companies will be excluded from the scope of the CSRD and the CSDDD. Around 90% of companies will be exempted from mandatory taxonomy. And our CBAM proposal will exempt 90% of importers. Together, these 90% of companies that we are exempting now from CBAM are responsible for less than 1% of import volumes and its associated emissions. So, the climate impact of this change is minimal. But the positive impact on SMEs is huge.”\nYesterday the Commission also took action toreduce high energy prices, which remain structurally too high, burdening companies and households. The newAction Plan for Affordable Energywill accelerate the rollout of clean energy and electrification, complete interconnectors, bring transparency to the gas market, and overall complete theEnergy Union.\nFinally, Presidentvon der Leyentalked about the global dimension of the Clean Industrial Deal. European companies need to adapt to harsher global competition, and to help them, the EU is seizing new opportunities.\nSince December, the Commission has concluded ambitious partnerships withMercosur, Switzerland, Mexico, and it relaunched trade talks withMalaysia.\nThe Commission is also committed to its ongoing trade negotiations withIndia, and the President mentioned her upcoming visit to the world's largest democracy and the EU's determination to engage with the world:“Tonight, the College of Commissioners will travel to India to strengthen ties and expand trade with the world's largest democracy. We have many friends around the world that want to do business with us, and my function is to enable and ease this business for you with other regions of the world.”\nMore information\nOpening address by President von der Leyen on the Clean Industrial Deal at the European Industry Summit\nClean Industrial Deal:\nAction Plan on Affordable Energy:\nOmnibus package:",

        "title": "Concept Note: Strategic Dialogue on Steel",
        "date": "Feb 25, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Context\nThe European steel industry is fundamental for European economy, providing critical inputs to many sectors, including automotive, construction, and defence. Around five hundred production sites across 22 Member States contribute about EUR 80 billion in GDPand underpin over 2.5 million jobs. Steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio-economic and political importance.\nHowever, the steel industry currently faces significant challenges. Production costs have increased due to high energy prices, while at the same time prices have dropped due to increasing global non-market overcapacity and decreased demand. Consequently, EU production has shrunk, and current capacity utilisation is below profitable levels. This undermines decarbonisation, as several companies have halted investments in green steel projects.\nThe recently publishedEU Competitiveness Compassestablishes industrial competitiveness as a core priority and sets outs cross-sectoral actions for the next years. It recognises decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth when integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. TheEUClean Industrial Deal(published later this month) will set out further transversal measures to ensure the EU remains an attractive manufacturing location, including for energy-intensive industries. Building on this foundation,additional sector-specific priority actions need to be identified and delivered.\nObjective\nThe objective of the Steel Dialogue is to jointly identify priority measures to deliver a step-change in competitiveness of the European steel sector and to safeguard value-creation and high-quality jobs in the EU.\nBuilding on theClean Transition Dialogueon steel in March 2024 and follow-up input, which helped form a collective understanding of the challenges, the ambition is now to work together to craft a dedicatedSteel and Metals Action Plan, to be launched in spring of this year.\nFormat and participants\nThe Steel Dialogue will bring together key representatives of industry, notably steel manufacturers, suppliers of raw materials and off-takers, along with representatives of social partners and civil society. It will be, chaired by President von der Leyen.\nWider consultations with other stakeholders across the industry as well as other parts of the steel value chain will also be conducted and will feed into theSteel and Metals Action Plan, to be presented under the leadership of Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy Stéphane Séjourné. The Council and European Parliament will be informed and consulted on the Dialogue.\nProposed elements for discussion\nCompetitiveness and circularity\nEnsuring globally competitive input costs and security of supply is critical for the European steel industry.\nThe Dialogue is an opportunity to give feedback on the measures outlined above, in particular as to whether they are considered sufficient to address the challenges of the sector.\nClean transition, decarbonisation and electrification\nThe transition to clean steel production is an opportunity for Europe to re-gain a competitive edge in the global steel landscape in the years to come. However, many of the necessary investments are currently being put on hold or postponed due to market conditions and policy uncertainty.\nWe welcome feedback on how to best designeffective interventions to make clean steel production commercially viable.\nTrade relations and international level playing field\nThe EU is a firm believer in the need to preserve an open and rules-based trading system that is fair, transparent, and balanced. To this end, the EU is determined to defend the steel sector against unfair trade practices, unjustified tariffs and discriminatory policies that unfairly undermine its competitiveness. Over the past years, we have adopted effective trade defence measures, upgraded the trade defence toolbox, and imposed a safeguard measure on a large scope of steel products. However, in light of increasing levels of overcapacity (expected to reach 630 million tonnes in 2026), it is essential to make more efficient use ofanti-dumping or anti-subsidy dutiesto prevent that our market becomes an export destination for state-induced excess steel production.\nThe announced 25% duty on all imports of steel into the US will have a major negative effect on the ability of our producers to continue supplying the same levels of steel to the US market and will exacerbate the risk of excess production being redirected to the EU. In addition, thesafeguard measuresfor steel currently in place are set to expire by June 2026. The Commission will define a long-term solution to replace those measures in light of global non-market overcapacity.\nTo preserve an international level playing field, we will also carefully monitor the effectiveness of CBAM implementation and take action.\nWe welcome feedback on how best to work together to respond quickly and effectively to unfair and unjustified trading practices, considering the ripple effects of global overcapacities, and on what long-term measures could best replace current safeguard measures.",

        "title": "Questions and Answers: An adjusted package for the next generation of own resources",
        "date": "Jun 20, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "How does the own resources system work today?\nThere are currently four own resources for the EU budget:\nThese four own resources account for more than 90% of revenues. Other sources of revenues include taxes and other deductions from EU staff salaries, contributions from non-EU countries to certain programmes, interest on late payments and fines.\nWhy is the Commission proposing a new own resource package?\nAs part of the 2020 agreement on the long-term EU budget and NextGenerationEU, the European Parliament, EU Member States in the Council and the Commission agreed on a roadmap to introduce new own resources to the budget to support the reimbursement of the NextGeneration borrowing.\nOn that basis, the Commission committed to make two sets of proposals for new sources of revenue to the budget. The first proposal was presented in December 2021 and included proposals based on Emissions Trading System (ETS), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and the OECD Pillar One agreement. Since then, little progress has been achieved. In an attempt to speed up the negotiations, the Commission has today adjusted and complemented its proposal, ahead of the initially planned date of 2024.\nHow is the final basket of proposed own resources calibrated?\nIn view of today's adjustments to the agreement on elements of Fit for 55, the package of own resources to be negotiated in the Council will consist of:\nIn addition, the own resource, proposed in December 2021, based on the share of residual profits from multinationals that will be re-allocated to EU Member States under the OECD/G20 agreement on a re-allocation of taxing rights (“Pillar One”) is maintained.\nHow much revenue will each of these elements deliver?\nBased ona carbon price assumption of €80 per tonne, the ETS own resource will generate about €19 billion (2018 prices) per year at cruising speed, when the revenues from the new ETS enter into the EU budget. It is estimated that the CBAM own resource will generate about €1.5 billion (2018 prices) per year as of 2028. The statistical-based own resource on company profits would provide revenues of about €16 billion (2018 prices) per year as of 2024.\nUnder current assumptions, this package is expected to deliver collectively on average €36 billion (2018 prices) per year as of 2028.\nHow will the new own resources contribute to the repayment of NextGenerationEU?\nThe repayment of the borrowing for NextGenerationEU will be spread over more than three decades, to be concluded by 2058.\nRepayments will be financed through the general budget in line with the universality principle of the EU budget.\nThe EU will under any circumstances honour its obligations to repay NextGenerationEU borrowing including interest and the repayment of the principal.\nHowever, this repayment should not lead to an undue reduction in programme expenditure or investment instruments under the MFF. It is also desirable to mitigate the increases in the GNI-based own resource for the Member States. Finding an agreement on the new own resources proposed today will facilitate discussions on the future long-term budgets and focus minds on strategic priorities, rather than the level of national contributions.\nIs the Commission proposing EU taxes with this package?\nThe Commission does not propose EU taxes with this updated package. The Emissions Trading System and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism are market-based instruments. The purpose of the revision of the Own Resource Decision is to allocate a share of the revenues generated by these instruments to the EU budget. Similarly, the temporary statistical-based own resource on company profits is a statistical-based own resource. The contribution due by Member States will be proportional to statistics on gross operating surplus. Companies will not be affected.\nHow will the EU collect the own resources mentioned in the package?\nAs regards the ETS-based own resource:\nThe Commission proposes a mechanism in which the largest part of the ETS-based own resource is collected and made directly available to the EU budget on behalf of Member States by the auction platform. The revenues are therefore directly transferred to the EU budget without being channeled through Member States' accounts. The auction platform is a vehicle under ETS legislation operating under the responsibility and on behalf of Member States.\nMember States that exercise their right not to auction some of their allowances are required to contribute a proportional amount. The ETS contributions are adjusted with the solidarity adjustment mechanism, requiring minimum contributions or capping them at a maximum contribution.\nAs regards the CBAM-based own resource:\nThe Commission proposes a mechanism where CBAM revenue is collected by the competent authority of the Member State where the declarant is located. Member States retain 25% of the CBAM revenues. The remaining 75% are made available to the EU budget by Member States once per year (in February) following the Commission's call for funds.\nAs regards the temporary statistical own resource based on company profits:\nThis own resource entails applying a 0.5% call rate to the gross operating surplus for the sectors of financial and non-financial corporations recorded for each Member State under the European System of Accounts (ESA). Member States make this own resource available to the EU budget monthly following the Commission's call for funds.\nAs regards the own resource based on reallocated profits (OECD Pillar 1), similar arrangements have been proposed. This own resource consists in applying a uniform call rate of 15% to the share of residual profits of the multinational enterprises reallocated to Member States and declared to the Commission. The implementation of the OECD/G20 Pillar 1 agreement remains an essential priority. Substantive progress has been made following the October 2021 agreement and the Commission will continue to promote such efforts. However, the multilateral convention has not yet been signed and ratified, which means that it cannot yet enter into force.\nHow do the proposals today relate to the Fit for 55 package?\nIn December 2022, the EU agreed on the Fit for 55 package, aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the EU with the objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\nThe original proposal for new sources of revenue to the EU budget was closely linked to the proposal for the Fit for 55 package. It therefore needs to be aligned with the final text, also taking into account new market developments considering the increased carbon prices.\nMore concretely, the updates concern:\nStatistical based own resource on company profits\nHow will the statistical own resource based on company profits work?\nThis new statistics-based own resource would be calculated on the basis of the gross operating surplus for the sectors of financial and non-financial corporations. This is a statistical indicator of profits for companies based in the EU according to the European System of Accounts 2010, verified and published by Eurostat.\nThe own resource would then equal 0.5% of the gross operating surplus.\nWhy are you proposing a “temporary” own resource rather than a permanent one?\nThe statistical based own resource on company profits aims at ensuring a contribution from the corporate sector before an agreement on the forthcoming initiative on Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT) is reached and a respective own resource is proposed and approved.\nGiven the required unanimity, also on tax proposals, an agreement on the two pieces of legislation is expected to take some time, which is incompatible with the need to speed up the negotiations on new sources of revenue to the budget.\nWhen will the new own resources apply?\nThe Commission proposes that the contribution from the existing ETS, covering stationary installations, maritime and aviation and from the statistical based own resource on company profit applies as of 2024. The contribution from CBAM and the new ETS on building, road transport and other sectors will apply as of 1 January 2028.\nThe own resource decision will enter into force once agreed by Member States in the Council, after seeking the opinion of the European Parliament, and ratified by Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.\nWhat are the legal provisions under which the package is negotiated and agreed?\nAny own resource proposal is being negotiated in the Council according to the special legislative procedure set in Article 311 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThis means that the adoption requires a unanimous agreement by all EU Member States in the Council following a consultation of the European Parliament. In addition, EU countries have to approve the agreement at national level, in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.\nWhat was the analytical basis for today's proposal?\nBefore putting forward today's package, the Commission carried out an analysis of all available options for new sources of revenue to the budget.\nThis analysis of new own resource candidates is available in the Staff Working Document (SWD) accompanying today's proposal. The analysis assesses the potential new own resources according to three criteria - revenue potential, simplicity, and fast mobilisation of revenues.\nToday's package presents the optimal mix of revenue on the basis of this analysis, in view of the need for a speedy mobilisation of new sources of revenue to the budget.\nFor More Information\nPress release\nFactsheet\nLegal acts\nRevenue | European Commission (europa.eu)\nThe next generation of EU own resources (europa.eu)\nOwn resources (Europa.eu)",

        "location": "Strasbourg",
        "text": "Opening Remarks\nThank you, Madam President, merci beaucoup madame la ministre, Honorable Members,\nIt is a year since you have decided to adopt the Climate Law. A historic decision, but it's only the beginning of the beginning of a very difficult process. And therefore, today, I believe we're faced with some really, really difficult choices that will determine whether we stay within the legal boundaries we have set ourselves.Reduction by 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 is not just a wish; it is a legal obligation. And I think that should be the starting point of our discussion today.\nParliament was also quick to rightfully call what we're in a climate emergency. We saw what the floods did last year in Germany, in Belgium and even in the Netherlands: killing people, levels of destruction we have never seen. We had a tornado in the Czech Republic – never before. We have completely erratic weather patterns: snow in Spain when you don't expect it, droughts and floods all over the place when you don't expect it.I don't think there's any European citizen we need to convince that we're in the middle of a climate crisis. It's not a crisis that will be coming down the road. It is here already.\nWhat we need to do is make this transition happen. The war is only accentuated the importance of making this transition happen as quickly as possible.Money spent on renewables in Europe, is money that stays in Europa. Money spent on fossil fuel bought in Russia is money that disappears and Putin's pockets and is then used to wage a war against his peaceful neighbors. This reality is the reality that should dictate the urgency of the measures we need to take.\nToday, I would like to plead for two things. I would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets and also I would urge you to make sure that in doing this, we leave no one behind. Our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy.\nI have to admit with all the admiration I have for what parliament has done so far, some of your positions do worry me. First, emissions trading for fuels and road transport and buildings. This is an incredibly important extra tool to tackle emissions and buildings and transport. In transport, emissions are not just rising gradually. They're shooting up instead of going down.In buildings, we need to double our effort to reduce consumption of energy.This helps our citizens reduce their energy bills, delivering better quality homes, reducing air pollution that still kills prematurely 400,000 Europeans every year. It is urgent.\nAnd then of course, we need this instrument to fill a Social Climate Fund that could help us help vulnerable households. If you look at what's happening, this is whatwe need to help vulnerable households to switch to clean forms of heating and mobility. Now, many members now want to reduce the new ETS to commercial buildings and transport, at least for the beginning. This will take two-thirds of the emissions out of the system. Instead of delivering 45% of emissions reductions in buildings and transport, it would only deliver 10%.\nWe agreed in the first European Climate Law to put ourselves irrevocably on the path towards climate neutrality. This is what Parliament asks for every time. Parliament also says ‘the earlier the better'.We know it can't be denied: the change must urgently happen in road transport and buildings. We know that member states have not delivered the reductions in the past. And yet you plan to weaken an instrument that can deliver the emissions reductions in a socially fair manner.\nHere I would like to address the members from member states with many vulnerable households. Please, please make the right comparison. Look where you are now.You're paying astronomical amounts of money for gas and oil to Russia and other countries. That money disappears. With our proposal for emissions trading and a Social Climate Fund, you would not only keep more money, but you could use it help your vulnerable householdsand you could do so before the effects of emissions trading are felt. First the Climate Social Fund and only then the emissions trading's effects will be felt. That is socially, I believe, the right thing to do.\nIt is only fair to ask those driving on petrol to pay a carbon price; those driving electric already pay that price. It's only fair that those polluting more, pay more. The heating and mobility of the 20% poorest in society only produce 9% of emissions. The 20% richer households emit 32% of emissions.A Social Climate Fund that uses revenues from the wealthy who could change their habits in order to help the vulnerable who cannot, is a fair way of redistribution. Yet, your proposal could cut the Social Climate Fund by half. This won't be enough to ensure a fair transition. We will have to discuss this in the trilogues.\nMembers try and compensate with more ambition for heavy industry and maritime transport. But don't think that this will shield the vulnerable. This too will have consequences. Power plants could lose an extra 16% of their free emission allowances. This would increase energy prices for citizens and this time without help for vulnerable households. And obviously it would impact jobs in industry too. We don't want jobs to get lost in industry, we want more jobs in industry.\nSo the Commission reserves its position ahead of the vote and we'll stand in trilogues for a package that is complete, coherent and socially fair. I am really grateful to Parliament for moving the package towards trilogues. Let's agree that ultimately, we want to transition in line with the Climate Law, the Climate Law which is binding on all of us.\nI want to ed by telling you I was in Poland, last week, talking to people who are faced with incredible price spikes, not just for oil and gas, but also for coal. Coal is also unattainable for many people. Everybody is saying: ‘How can I get my hands on solar panels? Where's the heat pump I can install?' That country is transforming itself at lightning speed. If you see how many solar PVs you see on rooftops everywhere.So,let's assist citizens who know they need to do this by giving them the right incentives and by protecting the vulnerable against the consequences.\nThank you.\nClosing remarks\nMr. President,\nWith all the political differences we have, with all the different angles you could have on this issue, my plea before you today would be: at least let's agree on the science. At least, let's agree that what the International Climate Panel has written is extremely alarming. At least, let's agree that whatever our difficulties may be, the climate crisis is not going to go away. It is going to intensify and the longer we procrastinate, the more intensive it will be.\nThat is not ideology. Ladies and gentlemen, that is science. Then, ideology comes in and you make the choices you want to make, but I would hold before you today: denying science, that's ideology. Denying science, that is using ideology to deny our children and grandchildren a safe future, by so-called ‘protecting what you have today'.\nWho will suffer most if we procrastinate? It is the poorest people in society. It is the people who have nowhere else to go. It is the small businesses. It is the farmers. These people will suffer most the longer we take to do what is needed. Rich people can always find a different place to live, can always find a way out. Ordinary people cannot. That's why I believe we need to act. Parliament knows full well, I respect the fact that you found a compromise on the dedicated ETS system. I don't agree with that compromise as you know, and we will see what happens in the trilogue.\nMy fundamental point here is: look, try and create as much transparency as you can, about where the costs will fall.Of course, there is a cost involved in introducing a price on carbon. But if you combine that with the Social Climate Fund, that will mitigate those costs for those most vulnerable or those who are hit most by this, then I think this is justified. If you put the cost elsewhere, which is what the compromise of Parliament does, then you have to also be honest, that cost, sooner or later, will also end with the same people. And then you need to ask yourself: is the Social Climate Fund big enough to really mitigate those costs? But we'll get there I guess in the trilogues when we revisit the issue.\nNow another element, which for me is extremely important and which was raised by many.As far as European industry is concerned, they want one thing and that's clarity. Clarity, predictability and reliability.So, let's not fudge things. Let's not introduce the idea that there could be also in the future fuels that would be clean etc. No, for cars and vans that's nonsense.The car industry has made its choice. Don't confuse them if they are already on board for electric mobility for cars and vans. Don't make it more difficult for them. And don't postpone 2035. Many carmakers are even on a sooner trajectory. 2035 is not science fiction.Some would even argue it is not ambitious enough, but I think this is where we could all land. And those car manufacturers that might have difficulty because they make smaller cars or are in a different position. They can profit from support from the Just Transition Fund to make the things happen more quickly. But don't create a fudge with a so-called 90%, or with these fuels that are way too expensive to ever form a solution for cars and vans. And by the way, we will need them in aviation but that's a different discussion all together.\nAll in all, Mr. President, I think we live in the most transformational time arguably that humanity has ever experienced. One could say that the first industrial revolution was also transformative. True, but it took a long time, and it didn't happen everywhere at the same time.This industrial revolution combined with a climate crisis is the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. And the bad news is we are coming late to this challenge. The good news is we can still fix it. If we act now. If you vote tomorrow to let us fix it.\nThe rest of the world is already following us. Yes, we are only responsible for 8% of global emissions. But the Chinese are copying our ETS system. The Americans are very interested in what we're doing on CBAM and looking whether they could have the same system. The circular economy that we are creating is copied everywhere in the world.\nLike it was with the internal market, like it was with environmental legislation, like was every time we took a step higher on the levels of our protection, parts of industry will say ‘this is the end of industry', ‘this is the end of employment', ‘so many million jobs will disappear'.The reality is that every time Europe ups the ante, our economy grows, our employment grows, and the rest of the world follows our lead. Let it be the same here again.\nThank you.",

        "title": "Questions and Answers – Strengthening and expanding EU Emissions Trading with a dedicated Social Climate Fund to help citizens in the transition",
        "date": "Oct 9, 2023",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "How has the EU Emissions Trading System been strengthened?\nThe review of theEU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Directivestrengthens the existing EU ETS and extends carbon pricing to new sectors.The environmental ambition of the EU ETS was substantially strengthened by the agreement tolower the overall emissions cap. Emissions from the EU ETS sectors willhave to decrease by 62% by 2030, compared to 2005, representing a substantial increase from the previous objective of 43% emissions reductions. Thespeed of annual emission reductions will increasefrom 2.2% per year under the current system to 4.3% from 2024 to 2027 and 4.4% from 2028. TheMarket Stability Reservewas also strengthened: this rule-based mechanism is designed to stabilise the carbon market by removing surplus allowances, and to improve the system's resilience to major shocks by adjusting the supply of allowances to be auctioned.\nThe manufacturing industry will continue to receive a limited share offree allowancesto address the risk of ‘carbon leakage'. Carbon leakage refers to the situation that may occur if, for reasons of costs related to climate policies, businesses may transfer production to other countries with laxer emission constraints: that means fewer emissions in the EU but more emissions globally. The rules for free allocation reward the most efficient installations. The system of free allocation has worked well in preventing carbon leakage, but to ensure that these industries pay an increasing carbon cost and are incentivised to reduce emissions, the revised ETS will gradually phase out free allocation allowances to certain enterprises. In parallel thenewCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)will be phased in between 2026 and 2034 for some sectors, to maintain a level playing field while effectively pricing carbon.\nThe revised EU ETS will includemaritime transport emissionsfrom 1 January 2024, covering around two thirds of emissions in the sector (90 million tonnes CO2), and complementing the new Regulations onFuelEU MaritimeandAlternative Fuels Infrastructureto help drive down emissions faster in the sector through the uptake of renewable and low-carbon fuels and infrastructure. Foraviation, therevised EU ETS rulesapplying to the sector will accelerate the implementation of the polluter pays principle, by phasing out free allowances by 2026 which currently cover 85% of aviation emissions.\nTo support efforts to reduce emissions frombuildings and road transportanewseparateemissions trading system(known as ETS2)will start operating in 2027. Revenues generated by this separate ETS will  fund the newSocial Climate Fund(SCF)that will ensure that the transition is fair for all.\nHow does the EU reinvest the money generated by emissions trading?\nThe majority of EU ETS allowances are auctioned almost daily at the European Energy Exchange (EEX), a commodity exchange platform. Most of the revenues from these auctions flow back to the Member States. Since 2013 auctions have raisedmore than €150 billion. Member States spend around 75% of these revenues on climate-related purposes. Now, as part of the revision, it was agreed that Member States must spendall of their revenues on climate-related projects.\nThe Social Climate Fund will provide €65 billion to the Member States to finance measures and investments identified in new Social Climate Plans. Together with the Member States' contributions (at least 25% of the costs of their plans), the Social Climate Fund will mobilise €86.7 billion. The Fund will support the most vulnerable groups through structural measures and investments in energy efficiency, the renovation of buildings (e.g. insulation), clean heating and cooling (e.g. heat pumps), and integration of renewable energy (e.g. solar panels) as well as in zero- and low-emission mobility and transport, including public transport.\nPart of the ETS allowances are auctioned specifically to finance the Innovation Fund and the Modernisation Funds. The size of both funds has been increased with this reform.\nTheInnovation Fundis one of the world's largest funding programmes for the demonstration of low- and zero-carbon innovative solutions and technologies in the areas of energy, energy intensive industry, mobility and buildings, funded entirely from the EU ETS and estimated at €40 billion until 2030 (depending on the carbon price). The Fund has so far provided grants for projects through calls for proposals and project development assistance. Following the revision of the ETS Directive, the Fund has a larger scope (including new sectors such as maritime) and features additional instruments (competitive bidding) to cater to market needs and notably also to support more mature projects. The Innovation Fund will provide the budget for a European pilot auction for the production of renewable hydrogen to be launched in November 2023 as the domestic leg of theEuropean Hydrogen Bank.\nTheModernisation Fundis a funding programme that currently supports ten lower-income Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) in meeting 2030 climate and energy targets by helping them to modernise their energy systems and improving energy efficiency. The revision of the ETS Directive brings important changes to the Modernisation Fund in terms of size and governance. In addition to the initial 640 million allowances, a top-up of 110 million allowances is shared between 13 beneficiary Member States – the 10 original beneficiaries plus Greece, Portugal and Slovenia. The total disbursements from the Modernisation Fund since January 2021 amount to around €7.5 billion.\nHow will the new separate Emissions Trading System apply to buildings and road transport and how would you support these sectors and households?\nTo support efforts to reduce emissions from buildings and road transport and fuel combustion in industry not covered by the existing ETS, anew separate emissions trading system will start in 2027. The start may be postponed to 2028 in case of exceptionally high oil or gas prices.\nThe new system will ensure cost-effective emission reductions from those two sectors, which have been insufficient so far, and will be crucial to put the EU on a firm path towards its goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\nThe new system for buildings and transport is an upstream system that will regulate distributors of fuels for buildings and road transport rather than households and drivers.Several safeguards are put in place to allow for a smooth start of thesystem and to ensure that there is no abrupt price shock for the consumers or households.\nTo ensure that the green transition is fair and leaves no one behind, theSocial Climate Fundis created to use the revenues of this system to address the social impacts of emissions trading on vulnerable households and micro-enterprises. It will operate from 2026 until 2032. Thus, it starts operating at least one year before the launch of the new ETS to prepare for and minimise the impacts. Moreover, the Member States are required to spend all their auction revenues from the ETS for buildings and transport on climate action giving priority to investment supporting the transition in the covered sectors and activities that can contribute to addressing social dimension.\nHow will the revised EU ETS reduce emissions from aviation?\nTheEU ETS system for aviationcurrently covers flights within the EEA and departing flights to Switzerland and the UK. From 1 January 2024, the revised EU ETS also coversnon-domestic flights to and from outermost regions that were previously exempted, increasing the amount of emissions covered by 7%.\nThe total number of available allowances for aviation will be stabilised at current levels, and the linear reduction factor will apply.Free allocation will be reduced by 25% in 2024, 50% in 2025, and with a complete phase out and full auctioning from 2026 onwards.That way, a robust price signal will be in place providing more economic incentives to cut emissions and the aviation industry will take its fair share of climate action and pay for its carbon footprint.\nToincentivise the use of sustainable aviation fuels, there are 20 million allowances reserved for covering a part or the whole price difference between the eligible fuels and the fossil kerosene, in other words a share of EU ETS revenues estimated at around €1.6 billion (depending on the carbon price) will be available specifically to invest in sustainable transport fuels. The EU ETS also incentivises the use of these fuels by assigning a zero-emission factor to them, thus emissions from these fuels are not linked with an obligation to surrender allowances, unlike for fossil kerosene.\nThe Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) isimplementedfor flights that are not covered by the EU ETS, namely for flights outside the EEA (except flights to and from Switzerland and the UK, which are covered by the EU ETS and the respective ETSs). In 2026, the Commission will carry out an assessment of CORSIA, to see if it is sufficiently delivering on the goals of the Paris Agreement. If CORSIA will be strengthened and the level of participation will be sufficiently high, the scope of the EU ETS will be maintained. Otherwise, the Commission will be obliged to propose to extend the EU ETS to all departing flights, with the possibility to deduct CORSIA-related compliance costs.\nMoreover, the revised aviation ETS will also create a new system for airlines to monitor, report and verify non-CO2 emissions and climate effects of aviation, which make up two thirds of aviation's total climate impact. Transparency will also be increased with more data on international aviation emissions published in a user-friendly manner, while protecting commercially sensitive data.\nHow will the revised EU ETS reduce emissions on maritime transport?\nIn January 2024, the EU ETS will beextendedto the maritime transport sector tocover CO2 emissions from all large ships (of 5 000 gross tonnage and above) entering EU ports, regardless of the flag they fly. From 2026, it will also cover methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\nThe system covers:\nThe new rules will generate revenues for national governments to reinvest in the green transition of the shipping industry, and the price signal will incentivise energy efficiency, low-carbon solutions, and reductions of the price difference between alternative fuels and traditional maritime fuels. The system builds on the provisions in place for other EU ETS sectors, as well as the recently revisedEU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Regulation for maritime transport (‘MRV Maritime Regulation'). To ensure a smooth transition, shipping companies only have to surrender allowances for a portion of their emissions during aninitial phase-in period:\nAreporting and review clauseis included to monitor the implementation of the rules applicable to the maritime sector, in particular to detect and address evasive behaviour at an early stage, and to take into account relevant developments in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).\nFrequently asked questionsare available to guide shipping professionals in understanding the application of the EU Emissions Trading System to maritime transport.\nFor More Information\nPress release",

        "text": "Memorandum of Understanding on a strategic and global partnership between: the Republic of Tunisia, hereinafter referred to individually as ‘Tunisia', and the European Union, represented by the European Commission, hereinafter referred to individually as ‘the EU', hereinafter jointly referred to as ‘the Parties',\nHaving regard to the historical links between Tunisia and the European Union, the strategic nature of their partnership, their common challenges, the aspiration of both Parties to enhance their relations by strengthening their economic and trade partnership, with a view to supporting the economic reforms adopted by Tunisia, necessary to restore macroeconomic balance;\nAlso having regard to the importance of enhancing cooperation in combating and reducing irregular migration flows and saving human lives, and referring to the high-level Joint Declaration of 11 June 2023, the two Parties agree as follows:\nMacroeconomic stability\nThe European Union undertakes, in accordance with the relevant rules and decision-making practice, to assist Tunisia in its efforts to boost economic growth with the aim of establishing a sustainable and non-exclusive development model through appropriate policies, including the socio-economic reforms designed by Tunisia.\nThe implementation of this approach shall be discussed in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe European Union shall support the reforms, in particular through budgetary support, whose amount for the year 2023 shall be paid in full.\nEconomy and trade\nThe Parties shall endeavour to strengthen their economic and trade cooperation with a view to develop trade in goods and services, to create a favourable and attractive business climate, and to promote investment and sustainable development. The two Parties shall endeavour to implement measures to promote and enhance the modernisation of the framework for trade and investment relations between the European Union and Tunisia in order to improve market access conditions.\nThey shall seek to identify opportunities for public investment, public-private partnerships and private projects, in particular under the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD+), in the areas of competitiveness and private sector development, modernisation of value chains and market surveillance, access to finance, sustainable water and agriculture, clean technologies and/or in the context of a circular economy, renewable energy, preparation for renewable hydrogen production and for the integration into EU value chains of strategic sectors with high export potential.\n1) Agriculture\nThe Parties undertake to strengthen their partnership in the field of sustainable water management to ensure access to quality drinking water, to work towards sustainable agricultural irrigation, including through the use of unconventional waters (rainwater, brackish water and treated wastewater) and to develop strategic water management and supply infrastructure.\nThe Parties shall endeavour to strengthen their cooperation on sustainable agriculture, resilience of food systems, and food security, including to the benefit of enhancing cereal systems and certain agricultural products, in particular through negotiations to be agreed.\n2) Circular economy\nThe Parties shall endeavour to enhance their cooperation in the transition to a low-carbon and resource-efficient circular economy that would include, among others, sustainable waste management including through public-private partnerships.\n3) Digital transition\nThe Parties undertake to cooperate in the digital sector, taking advantage of all available opportunities for collaboration, including capacity building, technological cooperation, financing and joint projects.\nThe underwater digital cable (MEDUSA) project could be an opportunity for Tunisia to benefit from a high-speed connection. Further opportunities could be supported by tailor-made programmes, given Tunisia's potential role as a hub providing internet connectivity to other parts of the African continent. The opportunities for Tunisia to participate in the Digital Europe Programme, and more generally any European initiative in the field of innovation and digitalisation, shall be assessed.\n4) Air transport\nThe Parties undertake to look into ways of increasing air traffic to and from Tunisia, while preserving Tunisia's flexibility to adapt to an increasingly competitive market. The Parties intend to examine the conditions for the signature of a Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement (CATA) for the benefit of tourism and connectivity.\n5) Investment\nIn the context of the international investment conference that Tunisia plans to organise, the Parties undertake to hold jointly an EU-Tunisia Investment Forum, the target sectors of which will be determined by mutual agreement.\nIn this regard, the European Union shall ensure the active participation of the European business community in the work of that conference and to prepare upstream the activities and target sectors to be proposed to investors and the prerequisites to facilitate investment decision-making.\nThe two Parties shall launch technical discussions as soon as possible, with a view to finding the best way of incorporating ‘investment' into the framework of the partnership and facilitating the organisation of direct or remote dialogues with European investors in order to better identify their expectations in the target sectors identified by Tunisia.\nThe EU is ready to explore ways of potential support for Tunisia's efforts to combat poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, as implemented through the economic empowerment programme.\nGreen energy transition\nMindful of Tunisia's potential for renewable energy and their common interest in ensuring greater security of energy production and supply between the two Parties, Tunisia and the European Union are working towards a strategic energy partnership, thus strengthening green growth and job creation. This strategic partnership will help strengthen the security of energy supply and provide citizens and businesses with low-carbon energy at competitive prices. It will also aim at strengthening the network infrastructure in Tunisia, including the smart grid.\nThe two Parties shall endeavour to strengthen their cooperation with a view to implementing Tunisia's commitments under the Paris Agreement, in particular its nationally determined contribution (NDC) and its national carbon neutral and climate change resilient development strategy by 2050 in the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nThe Parties shall endeavour to strengthen the production of renewable hydrogen and its derivatives, including ammonia, in Tunisia, which could serve its internal market and international demand, while taking into account the need to protect its water resources.\nThe Parties intend to explore the possibility of strengthening cooperation on supply chains for clean energy technologies and electricity generation in a mutually beneficial manner.\nThe Parties agree that the objectives of the strategic energy partnership require the large-scale mobilisation of targeted financial instruments, including guarantees, accompanied by appropriate reforms leading to a regulatory framework that is transparent, stable and predictable, in order to attract investment and the development of trade in Tunisia's renewable energy sector.\nAware of the strategic importance of the ELMED project, in particular with regard to strengthening their respective energy security, both Parties shall endeavour to:\nThis partnership will also address the instruments and regulations needed to enable Tunisia to export renewable energy and other products to the EU in view of the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nThe Parties agree that the implementation of the partnership should be based on a common roadmap, including priority infrastructure projects for renewable energy production and grid reinforcement, the instruments to be mobilised by the European financial institutions and the involvement of investors.\nThis roadmap would also aim at speeding up the implementation of Tunisia's ambitions for renewable energy production, including by (i) improving the performance of public services and public companies active in the energy sector, (ii) simplifying administrative procedures, (iii) putting in place the necessary instruments and regulations to integrate Tunisia into international trade in renewable energy and (iv) more generally reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector.\nPeople-to-people contacts\nThe Parties intend to continue cooperating to strengthen civil society, promoting dialogue between people and enhancing cultural, scientific and technical exchanges, including through the implementation of the 2016 joint youth partnership and other EU programmes in the fields of research, education, culture and youth, including skills development and mobility.\nThe EU considers foreseeing further support in these areas, in particular for technical and vocational training in the framework of mobility programmes and to strengthen the skills of the Tunisian workforce in order to support Tunisia's economic development at national, regional and local level. The EU is striving to continue its efforts to better harmonise Member States' practices in issuing Schengen short-stay visas to Tunisian citizens through the local Schengen coordination mechanism.\nThis may also result in greater cooperation in education, research and innovation, including potential support for greater participation in EU programmes such as Horizon Europe (with the possibility of strengthening European support for the programme and the EU-Tunisia cooperation on research and innovation ), Erasmus+ (where the EU would seek to mobilise additional resources) and Creative Europe.\nMigration and mobility\nBoth sides express their intention to develop a holistic approach to migration. They agree that migration must be addressed through the migration/development nexus, in order to harness the benefits of migration in economic and social development, to bring peoples closer and to address the root causes of irregular migration. In this regard, both Parties agree to promote sustainable development in disadvantaged areas with high migratory potential by supporting the empowerment and employability of Tunisian people in vulnerable situations, in particular through support for vocational training, employment and the private sector.\nThe two Parties also share the priorities of combating irregular migration in order to avoid loss of human lives and developing legal pathways for migration.\nTunisia reiterates its position that it is not a country of settlement for irregular migrants. It also reiterates its position to control its own borders only.\nThis approach shall be based on respect for human rights and shall include combating criminal networks of migrant smugglers and human traffickers, as part of the reinforced operational partnership against migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings announced in April 2023 - the content of which is currently under discussion, effective border management - and the development of a system for the identification and return of irregular migrants already present in Tunisia to their countries of origin.\nBoth Parties agree to continue working together to address the challenges posed by the increase in irregular migration within Tunisia and the EU, recognising the efforts made and the results achieved by the Tunisian authorities. They agree to work to further improve the coordination of search and rescue operations at sea and the implementation of effective measures to combat migrant smuggling and human trafficking.\nThe European Union shall endeavour to provide sufficient additional financial support, in particular for the provision of equipment, training and technical support necessary to further improve the management of Tunisia's borders.\nBoth Parties agree to further support the return and readmission from the EU of Tunisian nationals in an irregular situation, in accordance with international law, whilst respecting their dignity and acquired rights, and commit to work together towards their socio-economic reintegration in Tunisia, in particular by supporting the creation of economically viable projects for the benefit of local development and job creation. The EU will support and facilitate the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding also in bilateral contexts with the Member States with regard to returns and readmissions.\nThe two Parties also agree to support the return of irregular migrants in Tunisia to their countries of origin in accordance with international law, whilst respecting their dignity.\nBoth Parties agree to promote legal pathways for migration, including seasonal employment opportunities, to stimulate international mobility at all skills levels and to strengthen cooperation on skills development in a mutually beneficial manner.\nThe European Union shall endeavour to take appropriate measures to facilitate legal mobility between the two Parties, including facilitating the granting of visas by reducing delays, costs and administrative procedures.\nThe two Parties agree to work towards the implementation of a Talent Partnership to promote legal migration, in their common interest, in line with the mutual needs of Tunisia and the EU Member States, to the benefit of sectors of activity and occupations jointly identified.\nThe original version of this Memorandum of Understanding is in French.

        "text": "On 16 November, EU Commissioner for Climate Action, Wopke Hoekstra met China's Special Envoy on Climate Change, Xie Zhenhua, in Beijing, to prepare for the COP28 UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai. In a frank and constructive exchange, they agreed to increase cooperation on tackling the climate crisis, which no single country can solve on its own.\nBoth parties wholeheartedly underlined that climate science shows the urgency of action in this decade to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. The impacts of the climate crisis are dramatically felt both in China and the EU and remind us of the responsibility to fully commit to emissions reductions while making our economies more resilient.\nThey discussed the key issues at stake at COP28 including the Global Stocktake, decarbonisation of the energy systems, climate adaptation, climate finance and carbon pricing, and the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund.\nCommissioner Hoekstra highlighted the importance of ambition on emission reductions at COP28 via the outcome of the Global Stocktake. In particular he raised the importance of peaking global emissions as soon as possible this decade, and of tripling renewable energy capacity, and doubling energy efficiency measures by 2030, to contribute to the phase out of fossil fuels. They discussed at length what the end of coal and other fossil fuels means for industrial restructuring and how to make these efforts compatible with energy security concerns.\nOn the issue of climate finance, the Commissioner underlined that all parties able to contribute should do so in general, and in particular for the loss and damage fund. He also recalled the EU's role as the world's largest provider of international climate finance.\nCommissioner Hoekstra agreed to work closely together with Special Envoy Xie ahead of and during COP28 to ensure a successful outcome for all parties. Decades of continuous cooperation by the EU and China in the multilateral climate negotiations provide a strong foundation.\nCommissioner Hoekstra commended Special Envoy Xie on China's massive increase in renewable energy capacity over recent years. Beyond COP, he committed to continue close EU-China cooperation on climate issues such as carbon pricing and the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), measuring and reducing methane emissions, and scientific analysis. The Commissioner also raised concerns from the European side about the global level playing field, and expressed his commitment to creating mutual benefits from the green transition in areas such as innovation, clean technologies and industrial decarbonisation.",

CBAM is the EU's landmark tool to fight carbon leakage and one of the central pillars of the EU's ambitiousFit for 55 Agenda.

This will ensure that the EU's climate policies are not undermined by production relocating to countries with less ambitious green standards or by the replacement of EU products by more carbon-intensive imports. CBAM is a WTO-compatible measure that encourages global industry to embrace greener and more sustainable technologies.\nIn its transitional phase, CBAM will only apply to imports ofcement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen. EU importers of those goodswill have to report on the volume of their imports and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embedded during their production, but without paying any financial adjustment at this stage. While importers are asked to collect data for the fourth quarter of 2023, their first report will only have to be submitted by 31 January 2024. Furthermore, a number of flexibilities have been built into the CBAM's structure for the first year of application, such as the use of default values for the reporting of embedded emissions and the possibility to use the monitoring, reporting and verification rules of the country of production.\nThe transitional phase will serve as a learning period for all stakeholders (importers, producers and authorities). It will allow the European Commission to collect useful information on embedded emissions in order to refine the methodology for the definitive period, which starts in 2026. As of that date, importers will need to buy and surrender the number of “CBAM certificates” corresponding to the GHGs embedded in imported CBAM goods.\nTo help EU importers and non-EU installations in the practical implementation of the new rules, a new CBAM transitional registry will become available on 1 October to help importers perform and report these calculations. The Commission is also gradually making available detailedwritten guidance,online training materials and webinars,sector-specific factsheetsand a step-by-stepchecklistto support businesses as the transitional mechanism begins. Reviews of the CBAM's functioning and product scope during its transitional phase will be concluded before the start of the definitive period, as well as the feasibility of extending the scope of CBAM to other goods produced in ETS sectors.\nFor more information\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism",

        "date": "Mar 11, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.\nAs already mentioned, the first important discussion we had today was on increasing defence spending at EU and national levels.\nAs you know, following up on our ReArm Europe plan and the recent special European Council, the Commission is working intensively on a set of proposals to be presented shortly.\nAmongst others, the Commission will soon propose the coordinated activation of the national escape clause.\nToday's meeting was a good opportunity to gather first feedback from EU Member States on this initiative.\nThere was a broad support for a coordinated activation of the national escape clause.\nMany Member States emphasised that activation should be targeted and temporary.\nIt should allow Member States to transition to a structurally higher level of defence expenditure, while having fiscal sustainability considerations in mind.\nOn the definition of defence spending, there appears to be several advantages for using the already established definition of defence expenditure, or the so-called broad COFOG definition.\nThis provides for a scope broadly in line with the NATO definition of defence spending, and will allow us to move fast, using a concept that has a solid statistical basis.\nWe also took note of requests by several Member States to take into consideration the specificities of those Member States that already have high defence spending.\nThis discussion was very useful, as we will be able to take this into account before tabling the Commission's proposal, possibly already next week.\nWe also held our regular exchange on developments related to Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine.\nThe EU will continue to provide Ukraine with regular and predictable financial support.\nThis year, the EU is already mobilised to provide €30.6 billion in financing to Ukraine.\nThe Commission stands ready to frontload financing under these instruments if that would be required by Ukraine's financing needs.\nIn total, €135 billion in assistance has been provided by the EU to Ukraine.\nThat is more than any other of its international partners.\nToday, we also heard a strong support from Ministers for strengthening the enforcement of sanctions and avoiding their circumvention, in particular via sharing information amongst Member States.\nFor example, better coordination of data exchange and the use of AI could be of great use for our Custom Authorities.\nOverall, the message is clear: The EU's commitment to Ukraine is, and will remain, steadfast.\nMoving to simplification.\nEurope's security also depends on having a strong and competitive economic base.\nCutting red tape is an important element to achieve a more competitive Europe.\nToday's meeting provided me with an opportunity to present our first Omnibus proposals to simplify EU rules.\nThese proposals include, briefly:\na “stop-the-clock” proposal to delay by two years the application of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for companies that have not yet started reporting and a 1-year delay for the transposition and application of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).\non substance of the package, it foresees freeing around 80% of companies currently under the scope of the CSRD from very burdensome reporting requirements.\nmaking Taxonomy reporting more proportionate by limiting mandatory reporting only to very large companies.\na major simplification to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that limits obligations for approximately 182,000 or 90% of importers, most of them SMEs.\nprotection for smaller companies, and in particular SMEs, from being indirectly impacted by reporting and due diligence requirements, addressing the so-called “trickle down” effect.\nIn any case, these proposals are the first part of our simplification agenda.\nWe will continue this work over the course of the entire mandate.\nAlready, in the coming months, we will come with the next proposals.\nOverall, there was broad support for the first simplification proposals from Ministers, and I look forward to working with Member States to improve and enact the first two packages as soon as possible.\nI also provided our regular update on progress with the implementation of NextGenerationEU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility.\nThe Commission is currently assessing 23 payment requests amounting to a total of €68.4 billion, covering 806 milestones and targets.\nMy main message today is that the clock is ticking.\nThe legal deadline provides that all milestones and targets must be met by the end of August 2026.\nThis means that we have only 18 months left to submit all outstanding payment requests and supporting evidence.\nThis also means that Member States need to carefully reconsider the content of their plans to make sure that they are able to submit their remaining payment requests well on time.\nThe implications are clear: any measures that Member States cannot complete by August 2026 should be removed from the plans and replaced with alternative measures that can be delivered on time and can deliver, obviously on the RRF objectives.\nFinally, I would like to welcome today's endorsement of the targeted revision of the Belgian and Irish plans.\nThank you.",

        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis\nGood afternoon.\nLet me begin with the big picture.\nThe world is changing before our eyes.\nWe see dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape.\nThis week alone, we saw a long-standing strategic partner vote against a UN resolution condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\nWe need to treat these developments as a call to action.\nThe freedoms that we enjoy and the values that we cherish can no longer be taken for granted in a complex world.\nFor the EU, they also depend on maintaining and further developing our economic base by adapting, innovating, and competing in the world. In short, we need to build a more competitive Europe.\nEarlier today, my colleagues presented the Clean Industrial Deal and an action plan to bring down energy prices as part of that effort.\nCutting red tape is another important element to achieve more competitive Europe.\nPut simply, we cannot hope or expect to successfully compete in a perilous world with one hand tied behind our backs.\nThe past five years have been a period of intense regulatory activity.\nWhile our commitment to securing the green transition has not wavered, we must acknowledge that this has come at a cost, generating a large regulatory burden on people and businesses.\nAs we take stock, we see that this accumulation of rules, and their increased complexity, are limiting our economic potential and our prosperity.\nToday, regulation is seen by more than 60% of EU companies as an obstacle to investment. 55% of SMEs flagging regulatory obstacles and administrative burdens as their greatest challenge. In Europe, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute approximately 99% of all businesses.\nThey are most at risk of being suffocated by administrative burdens. They are Europe's economic engine, for whom we are speaking and acting with today's proposals.\nI also want to be very clear that we remain deeply committed to building a greener and fairer society and economy.\nSimplification is about making sure that EU rules help deliver – rather than impede – the achievement of our economic, social, environmental and security goals.\nIt is about achieving those goals in a smarter and less burdensome way.\nLess bureaucracy means more innovation and investment [that will secure our long-term prosperity.]\nIt means creating new and quality jobs for European workers.\nIt provides citizens with the opportunity to stay, live and work in any region of Europe, from Portugal to Finland.\nToday's simplification proposals also help to ensure that responsible European companies can continue to invest and do business across the world.\nThe alternative is retreating and ceding the ground to competitors who do not necessarily share our values nor working methods.\nTaken all together, that is why we have committed to this ambitious and far-reaching simplification agenda.\nLet me now outline today's proposals.\nCompanies and stakeholders have repeatedly stressed the need to ensure certainty.\nToday, we proposed a “stop-the-clock” to delay the application of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for companies that have not started reporting yet.\nWe also proposed to delay the transposition and application of corporate sustainability due diligence (CSDDD).\nThis seeks to avoid a situation in which companies that are required to report for the 2025 financial year (second wave) or 2026 (third wave) are then subsequently relieved of this requirement, incurring unnecessary and avoidable costs.\nWe will propose to the co-legislators to subject this proposal to a fast-track adoption.\nMoving to sustainability reporting.\nFirstly, we are freeing around 80% of companies currently under the scope of the CSRD from very burdensome reporting requirements.\nSecondly, we are limiting the information that larger companies under the scope of the CSRD can request from smaller companies not in scope – benefitting especially SMEs.\nThirdly, we will review the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, with a view to streamlining them substantially and making them easier for companies to use.\nFinally, we are lifting the mandate to adopt sectoral-specific standards and the possibility of moving from a requirement for limited assurance to a requirement for reasonable assurance.\nWe are therefore providing clarity that there will be no future increase in auditing costs for companies in scope related to sectoral-specific standards and the possibility of moving from a requirement for limited assurance to a requirement for reasonable.\nOn due diligence, we are extending the scope of maximum harmonisation, targeting due diligence, as a general rule, to direct business partners.\nAt the same time, the proposal recognises that there can be situations where companies have to look beyond their direct business partners when, for instance, they become aware of possible harmful activities at the level of an indirect supplier.\nWe are extending the intervals in which companies need to regularly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of due diligence measures, from one to five years.\nThis will significantly reduce burdens not just for in-scope companies but also for their business partners, which would receive (detailed) information requests as part of these monitoring exercises.\nRegarding penalties, we are moving towards a more proportionate regime, that shall be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, and longer linked to a percentage of global net turnover.\nFinally, we are moving away from the EU-wide civil liability regime conditions while preserving the right to full compensation for victims under the civil liability regimes of Member States.\nLastly, I turn to Taxonomy. Today the College proposed making Taxonomy reporting more proportionate, proposing that only very large companies (above 1,000 employees, and €450 million turnover) are required to report every year on their Taxonomy alignment.\nThis amendment will free more than 80% of companies from compulsory Taxonomy reporting.\nWe are also presenting unprecedented simplification changes to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nWe are doing this on basis of reporting and data gathered during the CBAM transitional phase where we learnt that tens of thousands of small importers were subject to the CBAM, but their imports represented only about 1% of CO2 emissions.\nWith a new threshold we are eliminating CBAM obligations for approximately 182,000 or 90% of importers, most of which are SMEs.\nThis is expected to bring about €1.12 billion in savings while still covering over 99% emissions in scope.\nThe new threshold will also bring cost savings to public authorities in Member States worth approximately €87.5 million, through less processing of importers who are now exempt.\nThis is a clear example of the win-win scenario that simplification can bring about: achieving our green objectives while strengthening our economy.\nWe also propose to optimise and simplify the functioning of several investment instruments including InvestEU, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and other legacy financial instruments. This proposal is breaking new ground.\nFirst, it entails a substantial reduction of administrative burden for our implementing partners, financial intermediaries and final recipients, notably the SMEs. These simplification measures are expected to generate a total of around €350 million in cost savings.\nSecondly, we also propose measures to increase the real investment capacity under InvestEU to mobilise around €50 billion in additional public and private investments. This will help address existing and emerging new priorities and direct the additional investment capacity in support of priority policies, such as the ones outlined in our Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal.\nToday's first two omnibus packages mark a strong start to delivering our simplification agenda.\nA conservative estimate puts the annual savings stemming from these packages at €6.3 billion.\nOur next proposals will target small mid-caps, farmers and changing paper reporting into a digital one.\nWe are determined to deliver.\nOur future prosperity and security depend on us taking action now. I will stop here. Thank you.\nCommissioner Maria Luís Albuquerque\nGood morning,\nWe started this exercise of simplification with two objectives in mind:\nWe need to achieve these two goals, as they are essential to regain competitiveness. And they are not incompatible, we can achieve both. And we should beambitiousin the simplification we bring about.\nWe can only achievesimplificationif we also look forsimplicityandcoherence. A simplification exercise delivering simplicity seems obvius, but in any case, good to keep in mind. Likewise with coherence: coherence between different pieces of legislation and coherence within the text itself.\nOne further element to keep in mind when trying to deliver simplification isproportionality. We need to keep in mind how requirements can be implemented by different companies.\nUrgencyanother element we need to bear in mind in this exercise. And what and why we do it for – competitiveness that can provide wellbeing for our people.\nWith this setup in mind, we have looked at how to simplify our sustainable finance rules – namely the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Taxonomy –\nHow do we see this package delivering on all these goals – competitiveness and sustainability which should go hand in hand?\nFirst, the “stop the clock proposal” delivers on simplicity, coherence, proportionality, as it will allow companies that will be descoped from CSRD to have legal certainty that they do not need to prepare for the reporting ahead of a final decision in this regard.\nSecond, the changes to CSRD are delivering substantial and ambitious simplification, in a proportionate way:\nThird, this package will be complemented by a re-assessment of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards to reduce datapoints and, in sum, make the reporting more meaningful and focused.\nFourth, we are also publishing a four weeks consultation, amendments to the taxonomy Disclosure delegated act and the environment and climate delegated act (level 2). The adjustments we are making to these two delegated acts will allow us a very significant alleviation:\nAs I mentioned, we are keeping the ambition of our Green Deal. How?\nThank you.",

        "date": "May 18, 2021",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "The European Commission has today adopted aCommunication on Business Taxation for the 21st centuryto promote a robust, efficient and fair business tax system in the European Union. It sets out both a long-term and short-term vision to support Europe's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure adequate public revenues over the coming years. It aims to create an equitable and stable business environment, which can boost sustainable and job-rich growth in the EU and increase our open strategic autonomy. The Communication takes account of the progress made in the G20/OECD discussions on global tax reform.\nFirst, the Commission will present by 2023 a new framework for business taxation in the EU, which will reduce administrative burdens, remove tax obstacles and create a more business-friendly environment in the Single Market. The “Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” (or BEFIT) will provide a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU, providing for fairer allocation of taxing rights between Member States. BEFIT will cut red tape, reduce compliance costs, minimise tax avoidance opportunities and support EU jobs and investment in the Single Market. BEFIT will replace the pending proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, which will be withdrawn. The Commission will launch a broader reflection on the future of taxation in the EU, which will culminate in a Tax Symposium on the “EU tax mix on the road to 2050” in 2022.\nSecond, today's Communication also defines a  tax agenda for the next two years, with measures that promote productive investment and entrepreneurship, better safeguard national revenues, and support the green and digital transitions. This builds on the ambitious roadmap set out inthe Tax Action Plan, presented by the Commission last summer.  Measures will include:\nThird, the Commission has adopted today a Recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses. The Recommendation prompts Member States to allow loss carry-back for businesses to at least the previous fiscal year. This will benefit businesses that were profitable in the years before the pandemic, allowing them to offset their 2020 and 2021 losses against the taxes they paid before 2020. This measure will particularly benefit SMEs.\nToday's Communication is part of a wider EU tax reform agenda for the coming years. In addition to the corporate tax reforms set out in the Communication, the Commission will soon present measures to ensure fair taxation in the digital economy. The Commission will propose a digital levy, which will serve as an EU own resource. The Commission will also soon come forward with a review of the Energy Taxation Directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), in the context of the “FitFor55” package and European Green Deal.\nMembers of the College said:\nValdisDombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said:“Taxation needs to keep up to speed with our evolving economies and priorities. Our tax rules should support an inclusive recovery, be transparent and close the door on tax avoidance. They should also be efficient for businesses big and small. Today's Communication will set the foundations for a corporate tax system in Europe that is fit for the 21st century, helping us to build a fairer and more sustainable society.”\nPaoloGentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said,“It's time to rethink taxation in Europe. As our economies transition to a new growth model supported by NextGenerationEU, so too must our tax systems adapt to the priorities of the 21st century. The renewal of the transatlantic relationship offers an opportunity to make decisive progress towards a global tax reform. We must work to seize that opportunity, while ensuring that an international agreement protects Europe's key interests. Today we set out how a global deal will be implemented in the EU - and the other steps we will take over the coming three years to increase tax transparency and help businesses small and large to recover, grow and invest.”\nText of the Communication\nPackage for Fair and Simple Taxation\nQ&A\nFactsheet",

        "text": "Chairman Keating, ranking member Fitzpatrick, distinguished members of the Subcommittee,\nIt is a really great honour and a pleasure to offer you a testimony as a Dutchman and European who believes in the enduring strength of our Transatlantic Partnership.\nAs we are still in the midst of the fight against covid19 we are also challenged by the climate and biodiversity crises. Both of them are closely linked and mutually reinforce each other.\nCovid is also a result of our failure to balance our relationship with our natural environment.\nThe costs of non-action are increasing by the day: freak storms, erratic weather patterns, floods, wildfires, and the astonishing and swift loss of species on which we are reliant for the crops that feed us. And unfortunately, there is a strong nexus between these crises and security as we will face conflicts over water and arable lands in certain parts of the world.\nAnd yes, I am a grandfather and the risk of our grandchildren going to war over water and food is something we really need to avoid in advance.\nThe European Green Deal is our answer. A modern growth strategy, encompassing everything from our mobility, our built environment, our energy production and consumption, our agriculture, our international trade and our taxonomy.\nWe pledged to become climate neutral by 2050. And in December 2020 European leaders committed to a new 2030 target of at least 55% emissions reductions compared to 1990.\nIn the near-term, approximately 800 billion of Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is Europe's medium-term answer to the COVID-19 crisis and the centrepiece of the “Next Generation EU”, which is our EU's recovery fund; 30% of the approximately 2 trillion dollars of the EU budget for the next 7 years are to be earmarked for climate action. And 100% of our budget should ‘do no significant harm'. And should never go into another direction.\nA comprehensive legislative package will be proposed in June to meet this enhanced goal.\nIn short, there are 12 proposals in the pipeline to bolster existing policies and regulations, strengthen targets and shift incentives towards sustainable practices in particular with regard to our emission cap and trade system, with regard to increasing our natural carbon sinks by protecting and restoring our forests, our forests are in a really bad shape, to our energy production in terms of more renewables, and differentiated energy taxation, and with regard to even higher emission standards for our cars and vans, and an extended charging infrastructure across the European continent.\nWhile we green and decarbonise our economy, we also have to ensure that we prevent so-called carbon-leakage. That is why we are drafting a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), designed to address this risk which, if unchecked, could lead to an increase of emissions globally. Ideally and preferably, if every country would fulfil its Paris commitments, it would never have to be used.\nI have laid out this ‘fit for 55' package in more detail in my written testimony, and I am happy to exchange views with you today.\nThis transition will be just, or there just will be no transition. This must be our guiding principle. That's why distributional issues will play a central role in the design of our policies, and I see this also well understood on the other side of the Atlantic.\nWe are not telling people to go live in cold caves and munch on grass. Ours is a positive proposition; one of cleaner air and water, lower energy bills, and of food with less pesticides. A proposition of a more resilient and inclusive economy for all with local jobs that are not immediately outsourced, like the insulation of homes and the installation of solar panels.\nCOP15 on Biodiversity in Kunming, China this October, and COP26 on Climate Change in Glasgow, UK this November will tell us whether the world will finally show its determination and commitment to do what is necessary.\nWe are more hopeful and optimistic of our success now that “America is back”. The appointment of Secretary Kerry as the President's special Climate Envoy is the best sign that the US means business and what John has been doing in the past few months is amazing, it really gives us all a lot of hope.\nWe are looking forward to working together with the Biden administration as well as with all of you. Our objective is nothing less than the health and well-being of our people, of our kids and our grandkids.\nThank you very much.\nThe written testimony is available here:\nhttps://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA14/20210420/112480/HHRG-117-FA14-Wstate-TimmermansF-20210420.pdf",

        "date": "Feb 26, 2025",
        "location": "Antwerp",
        "text": "Thank you, dear Dr Kadri, for the invitation.\nPrime Minister De Wever,\nMinister-President Diependaele,\nDear representatives of European industries and social partners,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt is a pleasure to be back with you here in Antwerp, exactly one year after our first meeting. Last year, I came to Antwerp to listen, to listen to your worries. It was a new start for industrial policy in Europe at that time. Since then, we at the Commission held dedicated dialogues with most of your strategic sectors, including a social dialogue just last week.\nAnd I must tell you, I am very grateful for these dialogues because the results have shaped the priorities of my new Commission. Today we approved in College the Clean Industrial Deal. The Clean Industrial Deal, if you look at it, delivers on each and every one of the ten recommendations in the Antwerp Declaration. Your central demand was to make a clear business case for Europe.\nAnd I am willing to do that. But before I address the challenges, let me start with a quick view on the strengths that we have in Europe. Europe has got talent. We produce one-quarter of all clean tech patents in the world. That is more than both the US and China. Europe has top-class infrastructure, and we are investing in it. Take for example the hydrogen sector. Last year, final investment decisions on electrolysers in Europe have quadrupled compared to the year before. That is the fastest growth worldwide. Europe has a clear roadmap, and we stay the course. Last year, our emissions from the energy sector went down by almost 10%, while the consumption of energy went up by 1%. And yes, we are on track to achieve our 55% emission reduction target for 2030. And this gives you the predictability you need to plan your investments.\nAt the same time, I know that too many obstacles still stand in your way. Prime Minister, you have mentioned some of them, from the structurally too high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden, without any question. We know all too well that production costs have increased, specifically for energy-intensive industries. The demand for clean products has dipped, and some investments have moved to other regions. So, we must turn the tide. And this is the central goal of the Clean Industrial Deal. We want to cut the ties that still hold you back. So that Europe can not only be a continent of industrial innovation but also a continent of industrial production.\nI want to highlight four areas on how we plan to do this. First, we have to and want to invest more than ever in innovation. It is actually one of the demands in the Draghi report: Close the innovation gap. Europe is a frontrunner for example in the global race for clean tech. Let me give you three figures. Here in Europe, we have 30% of all innovative companies in electrolyser technologies worldwide; we have 20% for carbon capture and storage; and even 40% for wind and heat pump technology. This is where we can really beat global competition.\nBut I know that too often, these companies struggle to grow, and to bring their solutions to industrial scale. This is where the problem sits. So what do they need? First and foremost, they need access to capital, to finance. And I will not speak about completing a deep and liquid capital market today. The capital markets union is absolutely paramount for us. But they also need public investment.\nAs a first step, we will make our European financing instruments much stronger. Our Innovation Fund has financed many groundbreaking projects, including here, in the Port of Antwerp. But we also see that every call of the Innovation Fund is heavily oversubscribed, and we have to turn down many of your good projects. So this has to change. Therefore, we will mobilise up to EUR 100 billion to establish a new Decarbonisation Bank. We will soon launch new auctions on industrial decarbonisation, building on the very successful model that you all know, the Hydrogen Bank. So the Decarbonisation Bank is the same principle as the Hydrogen Bank. Important is that this is a market-based system that rewards the most innovative and most competitive companies. This is just what we need – we need competition, we need them to be innovative, but they need access to finance. We will finance them with resources from our Emissions Trading System. The message you gave me last year was loud and clear. You said: This money that comes from the industry should be reinvested in the industry. That is exactly what we are doing now. So we are coming back to the promise we gave you last year.\nIn addition, we will present a new State aid framework. State aid for decarbonisation and clean tech will be approved faster, it will last longer, and it will give you more predictability to speed up innovation. And let me tell you: I understand very well that in state aid it is not only about European competition, but it is also global competition. So we have learned the lesson of the last mandate, we have to change and adapt the framework, and we have to be faster and more predictable for all of you.\nThere is one innovative sector I want to focus on in particular – and that is circularity. Europe clearly has a first-mover advantage here. One-third of all circular technology companies are European. And I know that some of them are present here in the room. If we look at figures, more than 50% of our steel, iron, zinc, or platinum are made from scrap. And this covers more than 25% of European consumption. But we need to go faster and further. For instance, China controls 80% of the global battery recycling capacity. And we still send huge volumes of precious waste back to China. Instead, end-of-life batteries could provide almost 15% of the lithium we need already in 2030. That is enough to produce 2 million batteries for electric vehicles.\nSo, we need a paradigm shift on circular economy. To support this movement, we will present a Circular Economy Act. We have to keep critical raw materials waste in Europe and give it new life. This is not only good for the planet, it also supports our open strategic autonomy.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe second pillar of the Clean Industrial Deal is simplification. We are delivering on the promise I gave you last year. Simplification is vital to Europe's competitiveness. So today we have presented our first two omnibuses. The omnibus substantially cuts reporting obligations on this magic triangle that is Taxonomy, CSRD, CSDDD, and we also added CBAM. This could save up to EUR 6 billion every year for European companies. This is more than the annual budget reduction target we initially set.\nWhat are the figures? If you look at CSRDand CSDDD, around 80% of the companies will be excluded from the scope of the CSRD and the CSDDD. Around 90% of companies will be exempted from mandatory taxonomy. And our CBAM proposal will exempt 90% of importers. Now you can say, what about the carbon footprint? Let us look at the figures: Together, these 90% of companies that we are exempting now from CBAM are responsible for less than 1% of import volumes and its associated emissions. So, the climate impact of this change is minimal. But the positive impact on SMEs is huge.\nAnd more simplification is on its way. I want to repeat my call I did my last year: If you come with good and doable suggestions, we are grateful for that, we want them, and as you see, in the first omnibuses we included already a lot of what you wrote to us. A fleet of omnibuses will target red tape and administrative burden in a number of areas. But let me be clear. Our climate and social goals do not change. Because our commitment to the social market economy is unwavering. The social market economy is the foundation of our European Single Market. Because the young people would never forgive us, if we did not rise to the challenge of global warming. And finally, because you, the industry, need predictability. In other parts of the world, we are now seeing the impact of political U-turns for investments. We are staying the course towards our decarbonisation goals. But on the way towards these goals we will be adaptable, flexible, pragmatic and technology neutral. This session here today is the proof of the beginning of this attitude.\nThe third priority of the Clean Industrial Deal is to bring energy prices down. You all said it, they are structurally too high. Europe's dependence on imported fossil fuels is the main cause of these higher and more volatile energy prices. The more we have to import fossil fuels, the more dependent we are on the global market. We have to bring these prices down. Of course, we do not start from scratch. Since the launch of the European Green Deal, we have saved EUR 60 billion of fossil fuel imports. How was this possible? Because of the low carbon approach; thanks to cheap, homegrown renewables; and as a baseload, nuclear. But we need more predictable prices than we have today. It is good that we have reduced them, but we need much more predictable prices and structurally lower prices. So, we need more connections across Europe, more energy offtake and more energy efficiency. All of this and much more is at the heart of the so-called Affordable Energy Action Plan that we also have presented today and that accompanies the Clean Industrial Deal.\nThe Affordable Energy Action Plan is about accelerating the roll-out of clean energy and electrification. It is about ensuring well-functioning gas markets, we sometimes have quite strange distortions of the gas market, and it is about completing interconnections and grids.\nEarlier this month, I was in Lithuania to celebrate with them their newly won energy independence. They finally decoupled their electricity grid from Russia and coupled it into the European Union grid. For the Baltics, this is not only about energy. This was very deeply about sovereignty. It is vital and it is strategic. We should do the same on our entire continent: connect our energy systems, upgrade our grids, speed up permitting – I speak to myself and all my colleagues in the political functions –, and make our low-carbon energy available all across Europe. We will systematically, with this Affordable Energy Action Plan, remove remaining obstacles, so that we build a true Energy Union.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe last priority of the Clean Industrial Deal I want to mention is to adapt to a harsher global competition. To remain open to the world, that is so important, that has always been the hallmark of the European Union. Seizing the new opportunities that are there and connecting to growth centres.\nSince taking office last December, the new Commission has been delivering on this commitment. In the first week of December, we finalised a groundbreaking partnership agreement with Mercosur. Before Christmas, we concluded one with Switzerland. In January of this year, we concluded trade negotiations with Mexico, and we launched negotiations with Malaysia. We are also negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with India. Tonight, the College of Commissioners will travel to India to strengthen ties and expand trade with the world's largest democracy. We have many friends around the world that want to do business with us, and my function is to enable and ease this business for you with other regions of the world.\nEurope has been an industrial leader for centuries, because we have always managed to ride the wave of change. Our industries have constantly renewed and remodelled. By families, who passed on their knowledge from one generation to the next. And by disruptors, who dared to leave the old path for the new one.\nToday, we stand again at a watershed moment in our history. I know that, together, we are ready for change. So that the future of industry can continue to be made in Europe. And next year I would love to come back, to report on what we have done in between,to listen to how your reality was in between.\nThank you very much for inviting me, and long live Europe.\n.",

        "title": "Frans Timmermans at Parliament Plenary session on the outcome of COP26 in Glasgow",
        "date": "Nov 24, 2021",
        "location": "Strasbourg",
        "text": "Openingremarks\nThank you, Mr. President, honourable Members.\nCOP26 did not solve the climate crisis but that was also not the purpose of COP26. It had to bring the objectives of the Paris Agreement within reach and allow us to start implementing this deal. This it did. This COP sharpened our focus and gave us momentum. I believe it does represent clear progress. I believe we're now traveling in the right direction, a direction set two years ago by the European Union.\nThe Glasgow COP embraced the highest level of ambition of the Paris Agreements as our common target. We now have a global consensus on the need to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. Ten days after COP26 this almost seems like a given but ten days before we began, the mantra was still below two degrees, and some countries even challenged the fact that Paris ever spoke of 1.5.\nIn addition, countries that do not have national determined contributions in line with this 1.5 degree target will have to come back next year to deliver the required update. For the first time, the parties of COP26 agreed to phase down coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Whatever you may think about the precise language that was necessary to get the whole package over the finish line, this is a big win. Of course, if you compare the phase down with the initial formulation to phase out, you're disappointed. But as Greenpeace said in Glasgow, changing a word doesn't change the signal.\nThe era of coal is ending!\nBefore Glasgow the commission set three objectives. One to push for emission cuts that brings us within Paris territory with NDCs that keep global warming well below two degrees while aiming for 1.5. Second, to close the gap on the $100 billion climate finance goal, while ramping up support for adaptation. And third, to complete the Paris rulebook so that we can keep track of progress and hold countries to account. The Paris rulebook, which seems like an esoteric subject sometimes, but it's essential to have carbon markets actually function in a way we want them to function. On all these three issues, we saw clear progress.\nTwo years ago in the COP in Madrid, the EU laid down our ambition for climate neutrality by 2050. At that stage, there was little to no movement from other major emitters in the G20. China, US, but also Japan, South Korea, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others. Since then, each of these countries has announced targets of their own, varying from climate neutrality in 2050 to net zero carbon emissions in 2060 and in a single case 2070, India. 90% of the global economy is now on a net zero trajectory, that was only 30% a year ago.\nWe went into the COP on track for 2.7 degrees, way too much, but a lot less than three or four degrees we were headed for in Paris. And after COP for the very first time we have a shot at staying below two degrees now. We will see in the coming weeks what the actual number is, but we still have a shot at staying below two degrees. I will not take into my narrative the 1.8 mentioned by the International Energy Agency, let's see in the coming weeks when we do the calculation where we are, but we have a chance of staying below two degrees.\nMoreover, COP26 agreed to accelerate our actions still this decade and revisit NDCs next year with a focus on the 1.5 degrees. This new marker on the calendar is due to a push from the EU to keep the pressure on, because the World Leaders Summit made clear that with the right pressure, ambition levels will in fact go up.\nOver 1/3rdof all global financing comes from the EU and its Member States. We are doing our share and more, and we continue asking others to do the same.\nHeading into the COP there was still a gap of about $20 billion on the developed world's commitment towards the developing world. This is why in this house the President of the Commission committed an additional €4 billion to climate finance. It pressured others to do the same or follow suit. Shortly after our commitment, the United States announced their own $11.4 billion commitment.\nDuring Glasgow, other donors added to this to bring us closer to this goal and we may reach it next year instead of 2023. We also started to look beyond 2025 and long-term needs. Adaptation finance will at least double, and we will start a dialogue to discuss finance for loss and damage.\nGlasgow also strengthened the global network of agencies that provide immediate relief and assistance to countries that already suffer from the consequences of the climate crisis. And here I must say the EU and our Member States played a leading role. Four Member States committed a total of $25 million to the Santiago network for its functioning and I think this is an important signal.\nThe issue of loss and damage will grow in importance in future COPs, and we should engage in all sincerity with those who already today suffer from climate-induced catastrophe. If we really want to succeed at the next COP in Sharm El-Sheikh, we now have to work closely especially with our sister continent of Africa in preparing this; on adaptation and on finance, on carbon sinks, on how to best have nature-based solutions, on how to help them in their energy transition. All these things are crucial, starting now, if we want Sharm El-Sheikh to be a success.\nI already mentioned the completion of the Paris rulebook, seems like a technical matter but it's of essential importance for carbon markets to start to work. Because the essence of a global approach to decarbonisation is putting a price on carbon, and you have to be able to compare the way we do that for carbon markets to work well. That now is possible because we can close the rulebook because it is agreed.\nSo what does this mean for the EU? Glasgow confirmed that the EU is a global leader and a necessary bridge builder. Our climate diplomacy, supported by credible policies and commitments, our carefully nurtured climate dialogues with countries like Japan, China, Turkey our outreach to others like India, Brazil, Indonesia, have helped to push all major emitters to step up their ambition. Each of these countries will roll out and accelerate its own green transition.\nEuropean companies who are already frontrunners in renewables, in hydrogen, in circular economy stand to benefit. Think for example of India, which committed to reach 500 gigawatts in renewable energy by 2030. That is a massive, massive opportunity, also an economic opportunity, for European industry.\nHonourable Members, climate action knows no quick fixes. It will never be solved in a single conference but the climate crisis is accelerating, and so should we. Fighting this crisis requires constant effort and unrelenting pressure on all governments, especially the major emitters. And it requires everybody's participation. That is why it is also good that this COP strengthened the involvement of indigenous peoples, the youth and local governments.\nNow we must set our sights on Sharm El-Sheikh as I said. Getting Fit for 55 adopted ahead of next year's COP will mean that yet again, the European Union is putting pressure on others to step up their game. All are following the fact that we are the only ones who have a real plan to get us to our emission reductions, legally binding emission reductions by 2030 and 2050.\nIn Europe, we must keep up the legislative work. You are so, so much in charge now with the Council to make it happen. We've come a long way, my friends, but we still have a very, very, very long way to go if we want to get where we need to be. Our situation, and I have to say this, our situation is dire but it's not hopeless.\nWhat needs to be done is bloody hard. Much harder than most are willing to acknowledge today. But it is a path we must walk, and walk it with speed and determination for all our sakes, but first and foremost for the sake of our children and grandchildren. It must be done, it can be done, it will be done. And please make it personal. Think of people you love. Think of people you want to act for. I think of my kids. I think of my grandson.\nClosing remarks\nHonourable members, let me react to some of the things that were said.\nFirst, mythical cost of the transition, and that climate policy is ideological. I think by now we can agree that denying the climate crisis is ideological. Science is clear. The evidence is clear. One would have to be blind not to see what is happening in our natural environment, globally, everywhere. One would have to be blind not to want to read the report of the Global Climate Panel, which is so clear. And the only reason we made such progress in Glasgow is because all countries on Earth have now seen the devastating effect of 1.1 degree increase of temperature in relation to pre-industrial levels.\nThat is why we now have the 1.5 enshrined in our decisions and that we have to insist on updating the NDCs for next year. I would implore, I would ask all of you, wherever you're from, if you talk about the cost of the transition in the same breath look at the cost of non-transition, which is so much higher. Not just in financial terms, but in human terms.\nWhat are you going to say dear friends from the ECR to the miners in Silesia if you just say stay put don't change. What are you going to say to those even from your party in Wielkopolska and other parts of Poland who are engaging in this transition, who have the audacity to say to their voters, guys, there is no future in coal, and we need to change. Please be as audacious as they are. And explain that this transition is necessary for our survival, and that the longer we wait with this transition, the higher the cost will be.\nAnd, as Robert has just said, Robert Biedroń just said , look at how many, 400,000 Europeans die prematurely every year because of bad air quality. They deserve better from us. So please, when you talk about the cost, talk about all the cost. And not seeing the cost of non-transition, that is ideological. Facing the climate crisis is science.\nWith all due respect to the right side of Parliament, it is great that there are no longer, hardly any climate deniers in your camp. But you came a bit late to the party, so others are a bit wary of whether this is a genuine. But I say on my behalf, it is genuine. Also because the industry understands this and are moving in this direction.\nThe second point I wanted to make is about the other countries. Two years ago it was a lonely position to be in as European Union. The US had as leader a climate denier. China didn't want to do anything. Look at where we are now. They're all declaring carbon neutral, climate neutral goals. Even Russia has done that. Russia is even introducing the first pricing of carbon, which would have been unthinkable a year ago.\nSo the world is moving. And you are absolutely right. On our own, we will not get there, but our example is being followed. China is introducing an emissions trading system based on our emissions trading system. Other major economies know they will all have to put a price on carbon, so they will all be faced with a risk of carbon leakage, so they're all looking at systems such as CBAM and comparable systems to avoid carbon leakage.\nOur solidarity with the developing world was clear in Glasgow. We pushed others such as the Americans who didn't want to do that to do more on adaptation finance. We put the money on the table when it was necessary to do that.\nSomebody mentioned Vanuatu, 300,000 People at huge risk, they were well represented with 32 delegates. That is the advantage of UNFCCC, they do represent more widely those who are most vulnerable. Vanuatu had more representatives at COP than some of our member states. And I think that's a good thing so that their voices are well heard.\nWe will have to look at many other measures to keep the developing world on our side. We need to look in the IMF what we can do with SDRs to mobilize them to help climate finance. Wonderful leaders such as the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Motley has given us the direction where we need to go. We need to listen to them, we need to make sure we give them, we amplify their voice, and we give them the solutions they need.\nEt finalement en français, par ce que c'est surtout dans la presse française, et ici dans les débats les francophones, qu'on insiste sur l'Europe divisé. L'Europe n'était pas divisé à la COP. Et au début on disait : ‘l'Europe est divisée, on ne la voit pas, elle négocie pas' etc. Ça on ne le dit plus par ce que c'est évident que l'Europe était très présente.\nEt je dois ici rendre hommage à la Présidence Slovène, par ce que c'est grâce à la Présidence Slovène que j'ai pu négocier tout le temps au nom de toute l'Union Européenne. C'est grâce aux réunions qu'on a eues avec tous les ministres. Aucun Ministre est intervenu dans les débats plénières, on m'a laissé la parole au nom des tous les États Membres de l'Union Européenne. C'est ça qui a fait la force de l'Union Européenne. On était pas divisé.\nEt maintenant on arrive avec un autre argument: le nucléaire. ‘Le nucléaire prouve qu'on est divisé en tant qu'européens.' Le choix énergétique des États Membres est un choix souverain. Il y aura des États Membres qui voudront avoir le nucléaire, il y aura des États Membres qui ne voudront pas. Mais cela n'empêche pas qu'on ait des buts en commun pour décarboner notre économie pour arriver à la neutralité climatique en 2050.\nDonc ne laissez pas vous dire qu'on est divisé. On a montré pouvoir être des leaders à la COP. On a montré qu'on a des projets que d'autres n'ont pas encore. On est copié partout dans le monde. On a vu, aussi les émetteurs majeurs rejoindre nos buts. Donc oui, c'est vrai, on est loin d'où on doit être. C'est vrai on a un travail immense à faire et ça sera terriblement difficile. Mais il faut convaincre tout le monde, c'est bien d'avoir un but en 2050 ou en 2060, mais comme l'a dit Camus, la vraie générosité envers l'avenir consiste à tout donner au présent. Merci.",

        "date": "Jun 29, 2022",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Si vous permettez madame la présidente, pas pour intervenir et dire que je suis en désaccord avec votre proposition, au contraire. Je voudrais bien renforcer vos mots en disant qu'on a un paquet qui mérite d'être soutenu par les ministres. Et je vais commencer en disant que le travail que vous avez accompli, chère Agnes, est quand même un travail remarquable. Votre équipe bruxellois mais aussi votre équipe a Paris a fait des choses que peut-être on n'aurait pas pu croire auparavant. Je crois que je n'insulte personne si je dis que en particulier Fabrice a fait un travail vraiment incroyable et vous pouvez être fière de votre ambassadeur au Coreper I. Et comme un dirigeant et bon maitre d'orchestre, il implique ses collègues dans ses félicitations.\nIf I can just make a couple of remarks also on the content. The sense of urgency created by Putin's aggression has clearly clearly inspired many around the table to understand that weneed to speed up our energy transition and make us more sovereign in the energy field. We also need to make sure we help our citizens reduce their energy bills so the sooner we get houses insulated, solar panels and heat pumps installed, the less we will depend on gas – expensive gas – and the sooner we can bring the energy bills down.\nIn theSocial Climate Fund, it is important to remember what this fund is about. It is about using revenues from emissions trading allowances to support those who cannot otherwise afford clean heating, insulation and clean transport. Of course you know that I would have prefer the fund to be at a higher level but the now Council position delays the starting date of the SCF with the year [and] the total size is therefore lower that what we proposed as Commission. So whatever you think about this, one thing is clear Europe will have a SCF and with €59 bn it is a very very substantial fund.\nLet me say a few words about theCO2 standards. I am glad that Council has also embraced a notion that by 2035 we need to move to a zero emission mobility. As regards the additional recital and review clause, we will continue to support you in implementing this policy but you will understand that institutional reasons, I have to point to the fact that the Commission has the right to initiative. So we will use that right in accordance with the provisions in the treaty and I will submit a declaration to point that out.\nI am sure that those of you who are regulars in the Council understand that this is what the Commission always says. We need to make sure that our right to initiative is respected. Whether our assessment will lead to Commission proposals or the content of any proposal will need to be decided by the College of Commissioners at a later stage. But my engagement in this direction is clear to all of you. And I think there cannot be any misunderstanding about that.\nI also have full confidence at the European car industry can manage.Our carmakers are among Europe's industrial leaders and can continue that as they embraced this global shift. But we will make an assessment of where we will be in a couple of years' time. Then we will see what comes out of this and we will do this on the basis of – as we have always done – technological neutrality but well looking at the facts.\nFinally, nobody here is under any illusion that this transition is going to be easy. But the climate crisis and its consequences are clear. Policy is unavoidable and the transition is essential for our health, for our prosperity, for our security now and in the future. That is why, I believe what you are hopefully about to do today hashistoric significanceand it will allow us to move rapidly in the trilogues with the co legislator on all the files pertaining to this issue. Not only what we decided today, also what we decided yesterday in the Energy Council, what was decided earlier in the Transport Council, and what was decided in the ECOFIN on CBAM.\nOnce again, my appreciation, my respect and my admiration for what you have done as Presidency and Iwarmly, warmly recommend this compromise as the real balance way forwardthat I hope everybody around the table can support it.\nThank you",

        "date": "Mar 26, 2024",
        "location": "Brussels",
        "text": "Mesdames et Messieurs les députés,\nJe suis heureux de participer à la réunion plénière de la COSAC, sous les auspices de la Présidence belge. Parce qu'elle réunit sous son égide les Parlements nationaux – y compris des pays-candidats – et le Parlement européen, qui nous accueille aujourd'hui, la COSAC incarne, je dirais, notre démocratie européenne dans toute sa diversité et sa vitalité. L'occasion pour nous de réaffirmer les valeurs qui nous fédèrent.\n[Introduction : de la nécessité de reprendre notre destin en main]\nCes valeurs, nous les avons forgées des décennies durant. Nous sommes le premier grand continent démocratique de la planète, et les échéances électorales de juin prochain constituent sans nul doute un rendez-vous essentiel.\nAu regard du cours de l'histoire, ces élections sont sans doute les plus importantes depuis longtemps : il s'agit d'envoyer au Parlement européen les femmes et les hommes qui sauront créer des consensus et coalitions pour répondre aux enjeux des années à venir.\nÀ commencer par celui de l'autonomie européenne. Car sans autonomie européenne, il ne peut y avoir de démocratie européenne. Sans autonomie, nous ne pourrons pas faire valoir nos ambitions ; nous ne pourrons pas prospérer ni nous protéger. Mais attention, il ne faut pas confondre autonomie avec isolation ou repli sur soir. Nous parlons d'une Europe plus assertive dans la protection de ses concitoyens, ses entreprises, ses intérêts stratégiques.\nCe nouveau paradigme a fait son chemin au gré des crises que nous avons traversées ces quatre dernières années.\nC'est en 2020, au moment de la pandémie de COVID-19, que nous avons pris véritablement la mesure de nos dépendances, et de certaines conséquences de la mondialisation :  je pense en particulier à la segmentation géographique des chaînes de valeur mondiales ; à l'élongation des chaînes d'approvisionnement ; au totem d'une Europe sans usines, qui hypothèque nos emplois et notre savoir-faire.\nJe le dis clairement : l'Europe est et restera un continent ouvert sur le monde. C'est dans notre ADN.\nNous représentons 16% des exportations mondiales, plus que notre part dans le PIB mondial. Mais dans le même temps nous devons ajuster notre logiciel : pour rester ouverts, certes, mais à nos conditions.\nEt je vois dans la politique industrielle européenne le versant opérationnel de cette autonomie : une politique industrielle volontariste, qui puise au plus profond de nos atouts – ce sera mon premier point ; une politique industrielle qui doit pouvoir s'appuyer sur des conditions règlementaires et financières propices à la compétitivité de l'Europe – ce sera mon deuxième point.\n[1. Capacités industrielles, sécurité économique, défense :une politique industrielle moteur et garante de notre autonomie]\nPour que l'Europe se dote d'une politique industrielle qui soit à la fois moteur et garante de son autonomie, nous devons, il me semble, nous atteler à trois grands chantiers plus que jamais imbriqués : nos capacités de production ; notre sécurité économique ; et, contexte géopolitique oblige, notre industrie de défense.\nD'abord sur nos capacités de production. Nous devons en finir avec le totem d'une Europe sans usine que je viens d'évoquer, car il s'agit ni plus ni moins que d'un anachronisme :  les profondes mutations de l'industrie, en particulier les interactions grandissantes avec l'environnement numérique, rendent la proximité entre les lieux de production, les centres de recherche et les destinataires finaux plus essentielle que jamais.\nÀ l'heure de ce que j'appelle la géopolitique des chaînes de valeur, il n'est plus acceptable que plus des trois quarts du cloud public européen soient encore détenus par les Américains. Il n'est plus acceptable que nous dépendions à 80% de la région indo-pacifique pour nos approvisionnements en semi-conducteurs.\nJe pourrais évoquer également la chaîne de valeur du photovoltaïque, presque entièrement captée par la Chine, dont les surcapacités – trois fois la demande mondiale – ont fait baisser les prix de moitié en un an, menaçant directement la pérennité de notre industrie solaire.\nPour corriger cela, plusieurs jalons importants ont d'ores et déjà été posés. D'abord nous avons renforcé notre arsenal réglementaire pour faire monter en puissance nos capacités manufacturières – je pense au règlement sur les semiconducteurs, le Chips Act – qui à ce jour a permis de mobiliser plus de cent milliards d'euros d'investissements publics et privés, mais aussi aux règlements sur l'industrie zéro nette et les matières premières critiques.\nEn parallèle, nous avons continué d'étoffer notre boîte à outils industrielle. J'ai à l'esprit les alliances industrielles – comme la toute récente alliance pour les petits réacteurs nucléaires modulaires – pour faire aboutir des projets de rupture dans les domaines technologiques les plus critiques, et dont certains peuvent devenir des Projets importants d'intérêt européen commun – les PIIEC.\nJe parlais à l'instant du cloud : à la fin de l'année 2023, plusieurs États-membres ont lancé, avec l'aval de la Commission, un PIIEC sur les infrastructures et services en nuage de nouvelle génération. Plus d'un milliard d'euros vont pouvoir être mobilisés au service de la recherche, le développement et le déploiement industriel, pour contribuer à l'émergence d'un cloud européen souverain.\nConcernant notre souveraineté numérique au sens large, nous sommes là aussi en train de faire bouger les lignes :  j'ai à l'esprit bien sûr la législation sur les services et marchés numériques (DSA-DMA), tout le travail pionnier sur l'intelligence artificielle, sur les données, la cybersécurité et les infrastructures numériques.\nBien évidemment, tout ce travail autour de la consolidation de nos capacités industrielles ne peut pas se faire en vase-clos. Je le disais, nous évoluons dans une géopolitique complexe, où la notion de sécurité économique joue un rôle de plus en plus prépondérant. C'est, je dirais, le deuxième grand chantier auquel nous devons nous atteler.\nNous savons que les dépendances asymétriques dont nous pâtissons peuvent tourner au chantage ou à la coercition par ceux qui ont les cartes en main – je pense au gaz russe ou aux terres rares venues de Chine.\nJe le répète, nous devons rester ouverts sur le monde, mais nous devons le faire intelligemment. Nous devons mieux anticiper et réduire les risques sur les technologies les plus critiques, diversifier nos approvisionnements, notamment en développant nos partenariats stratégiques mais aussi, lorsque cela sera justifié, de prendre des mesures de défense commerciale.\nSur ce dernier point, nous avons déjà obtenu de premiers résultats, avec notre règlement sur les subventions étrangères, dans le domaine du rail, et je l'espère bientôt dans d'autres domaines.\nMais bien entendu, comme je viens de l'évoquer, la sécurité économique c'est aussi la diversification, la coopération avec nos partenaires.\nJe me félicite des progrès que nous avons accomplis en matière de partenariats stratégiques, notamment sur les matières premières, qui nous permettront de diversifier notre approvisionnement, et nous avons par ailleurs conclu des partenariats numériques avec le Japon, la Corée du Sud, Singapour et le Canada. Plus généralement, nous devons aussi travailler avec tous nos partenaires internationaux, notamment dans le cadre de l'initiative « Global Gateway ».\nEnfin, le troisième grand chantier, qui a trait également à la sécurité mais sous un autre angle : l'industrie de défense. Pour obtenir la paix, prépare la guerre, dit-on. En d'autres termes, nous devons monter en puissance sur notre industrie de défense. L'Europe doit prendre en main sa propre sécurité, qui ne peut pas dépendre des résultats d'élections chez nos alliés tous les quatre ans.\nNous avançons, et nous avançons ensemble. Vous le savez, la Commission a présenté récemment une stratégie pour l'industrie de défense. C'est une première. Cette stratégie, via le programme européen industriel de défense, va nous permettre de booster nos capacités, notre réactivité et notre compétitivité. Nous devons donc faire bloc et mutualiser toutes nos forces à l'échelle européenne.\nMais bien sûr, tout cela ne fonctionne que si nous continuons également à promouvoir notre agenda de compétitivité. Ce sera le deuxième et dernier axe de mon intervention.\n[2. Une politique industrielle qui s'appuie sur un cadre d'investissement et de règles robustes, pour assurer le continuum autonomie - compétitivité]\nJ'entends et je lis beaucoup de choses sur le fait que l'UE est en train de se laisser distancer par les États-Unis en termes de compétitivité.\nSelon certains analystes, le PIB de l'UE représentait 90 % du PIB des États-Unis il y a dix ans, et n'en représenterait plus que 60 % aujourd'hui.\nJe n'ai pas entendu ces mêmes analystes dans les années 2000 féliciter l'UE pour ses performances largement supérieures à celles des États-Unis. Et pourtant, si l'on utilise le même indicateur, c'est exactement ce qui s'est passé. Le PIB de l'UE est passé de 70 % du PIB américain en 2000 à 110 % en 2008.\nMais cette analyse est erronée. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'elle est basée sur les taux de change actuels.\nOr, ce n'est pas sorcier, pour comparer la situation économique de deux pays, la meilleure façon est d'utiliser la parité de pouvoir d'achat (PPA).\nQue constatons-nous lorsque nous appliquons cette approche ? Que la différence entre l'UE et les États-Unis n'a pas changé depuis des décennies.\nCe qui est remarquable pour au moins deux raisons :\nAlors bien sûr, tout n'est pas parfait. Le chemin est encore long pour garantir notre compétitivité.\nEt cela passe par mettre à disposition des moyens financiers adéquats. Surmonter nos dépendances, réussir notre double transition verte et numérique, assurer notre sécurité tout en restant compétitifs : tout cela veut dire qu'il va falloir attirer et dé-risquer des investissements colossaux, y compris – ne craignons plus de le dire – en activant le levier des financements publics.\nPour ma part, je milite à Bruxelles pour un véritable changement de paradigme, qui commence par le budget européen. Avec une guerre de haute intensité à nos portes, avec une course mondiale aux technologies vertes et numériques, avec des pratiques commerciales de la part de nos concurrents toujours plus agressives, je pose la question : l'Europe peut-elle se contenter d'un budget qui ne dépasse pas 1% de son PIB ? Vous connaissez ma réponse.\nEnfin, notre marché intérieur. Il est la matrice de notre autonomie et de notre compétitivité. Nous devons continuer de le consolider, de le moderniser, car c'est grâce à son envergure et à sa taille critique que nous pourrons faire de notre politique industrielle un véritable levier de puissance au service de nos ambitions et de notre compétitivité.\nJe pense par exemple au mécanisme carbone d'ajustement aux frontières – le CBAM – que nous avons réussi à mettre en place pour répondre à la problématique des fuites de carbone. Nous devons généraliser cette approche à d'autre domaines, comme par exemple l'économie circulaire.\nDans le même esprit, les achats publics sont un autre levier stratégique : les attributions de marchés publics ne peuvent plus être régentées par le seul critère prix. Il faut également mettre dans la balance des critères plus qualitatifs, comme les critères environnementaux, sociaux ou de résilience européenne. Autrement dit, passer du moins au mieux-disant, car porteur de compétitivité pour l'industrie européenne.\nLe marché intérieur nous donne le poids nécessaire pour faire bouger les lignes, mais je le disais, nous devons le consolider et le moderniser. Le consolider d'abord, en continuant de faire tomber les barrières, avec l'aide des États-membres ; en l'adaptant au nouveau temps des crises majeures, avec notamment le futur règlement sur les situations d'urgence et la résilience du marché intérieur. Le moderniser ensuite, en continuant à développer des outils numériques comme le Single Digital Gateway pour faciliter la vie des citoyens et des entreprises.\nEt puisque nous parlons des entreprises, un dernier mot sur les PME, qui je le rappelle sont le cœur et le moteur de notre marché intérieur. Il faut leur faciliter la vie, leur donner un cadre clair et prévisible. Tout d'abord en s'assurant que notre législation est adaptée et ne crée pas de charge administrative inutile. Il s'agit par exemple d'allonger les périodes de transition pour les PME et de veiller à ce que leurs obligations soient proportionnées.\n*\nVoici, Mesdames et Messieurs, et j'en finirai par là, ce que recouvre, à mon sens, notre agenda de politique industrielle, au service de notre projet européen.\nCar oui, il s'agit bien d'un projet, un projet de paix et de prospérité qu'il faut sans cesse remettre sur le métier. Le travail parlementaire en est l'un des piliers essentiels, et malgré les temps incertains qui s'annoncent, je sais pouvoir compter sur notre envie commune d'avancer ensemble.\nEn cette grande année démocratique pour l'Europe, cette détermination d'avancer ensemble est plus importante que jamais.\nJe vous remercie.",
