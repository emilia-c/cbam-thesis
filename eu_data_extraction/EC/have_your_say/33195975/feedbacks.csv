Ares(2024)7742910 - 31/10/2024: Considering the importance of the successful realisation of the CBAM arrangement it is important to be able to review the impacts of the mechanism. To secure a best possible base for such assessment a collection of import and re-export information is vital. However, considering the diversified nature of Customs systems it is essential to allow for alternative methods of conveying such data to the Commission and the CBAM registry other than the Surveillance system, until common solutions are found for all CBAM reporting countries. Norwegian Customs therefore supports the possibility to use alternative ways to report the CBAM data as suggested in the proposals preamble number 10 and in article 5 no 1 (g): the CBAM Transitional Registry as referred to in Article 10 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773.",,anonymous,public_authority,large,closed,33195975,national,authority,,

The CBAM should be the official source of emissions for transactions conducted with the EU, aiming to reduce the reporting burden on operators. The obligation to report emission data in the CBAM should be annual for those operators who only calculate emissions once a year. Deadlines for data updates, declarations, record validity, or other relevant milestones in the system should be systematically notified to declarants and operators via electronic messages sent to previously registered email addresses, with 60, 30, 15, and 10 days' notice. The CBAM should have its mapping of accredited verifiers available in regions other than the EU. The approval period for the registrar (120 days is too long) should be reduced, or at least an emergency procedure should be created. There is a need to develop regulations for the financial guarantees required to cover CBAM certificates. Additionally, non-financial guarantees should be accepted. Simplification of forms with the possibility of cross-authorization between registrars so that one can use the information of the other, if it makes sense.

Nur registrierte CBAM-Anmelder können dann die betroffenen Güter im Zollgebiet der EU anmelden und die Einfuhr ermöglichen. Es ist sehr wesentlich, dass eine derart komplexe Berichtspflicht wie der CBAM über ein technisches einwandfrei funktionierendes Berichtstool verfügt. Die Bedienerfreundlichkeit des Portals muss sichergestellt werden. Insbesondere müssen die Erfahrungen mit dem Übergangsregister einfließen. Es sollte umfangreiche Testmöglichkeiten vor dem Start des Echtbetriebs geben. Wir bitten um Überprüfung, ob das neue Register alle Anforderungen erfüllt, die für die Unternehmen wichtig sind. Wir haben sie im Folgenden aufgeführt. Die Anforderungen an das CBAM-Register aus Sicht der Unternehmen sind die Folgenden (Auswahl): - Das CBAM-Register sollte in allen Amtssprachen der EU zur Verfügung gestellt werden. - Es sollte eine funktionsfähige Übersichtsversion zum Melden von Daten ohne Registrierung geben. - Die Fehlermeldungen sollten einfach verständlich sein, um die Erstellung und Abgabe der CBAM-Berichte zu beschleunigen. - Erklärungen für Eingabefelder sollten das Ausfüllen unterstützen und vereinfachen. - Die Zolldaten der importierten CBAM-Güter pro Importeur sollten auf Basis dessen EORI-Nummer direkt im Register bereitgestellt werden. Dafür sollten Importdaten von der Zollverwaltung vorab zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Das meldepflichtige Unternehmen prüft, korrigiert und ergänzt diese dann, nicht erst nach dem Hochladen des CBAM-Berichts. Dies würde auch helfen, sicherzustellen, dass Unternehmen vollständige CBAM-Berichte abgeben. - Es muss eine praktikable De-Minimis-Regelung für Kleinsendungen eingeführt werden. Diese kann sich am Gewicht orientieren, beispielsweise eine Tonne oder am Wert. Beim CBAM-System in Großbritannien liegt die De-Minimis-Schwelle beispielsweise bei 50.000 Pfund. - Bei der Eingabe der Daten sollte für die Nutzer ersichtlich sein, ob Daten auf Positionseben im System gespeichert wurden. Es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass Daten, die versehentlich gelöscht wurden, wiederhergestellt werden können. - Es sollte es möglich sein, Daten im System zwischenzuspeichern. - Sollte es zu Systemüberlastungen oder -ausfällen kommen, sollte es systemseitig eine Mitteilung geben, sobald das System wieder stabil ist und eine weitere Dateneingabe wieder möglich ist. - Es muss möglich sein, dass Unternehmen CBAM-Berichte herunterladen können. - Eine System to System connection muss unbedingt gewährleistet sein, damit bei hohen Volumen nicht einzelne Angaben gemacht werden müssen. Ein Excel-Upload reicht nicht aus. - Der Excel-Upload sollte dahingehend vereinfacht werden, sodass Auswertungen aus den bekannten Zollsoftwareanwendungen einfach ergänzt und eingespielt werden können. - Das Register sollte eine zentrale Meldung für mehrere Unternehmensteile oder Schwesterunternehmen ermöglichen. Ein konzerneinheitliches CBAM-Reporting (ein CBAM-Deklarant für mehrere Unternehmensteile, Tochtergesellschaften o. ä.) würde bei größeren Unternehmen oder Unternehmensverbünden den administrativen Aufwand zum Teil deutlich reduzieren. Dies muss auch mitgliedstaatenübergreifend möglich sein. - Gleichzeitig muss es für Vertreter mehrerer anderer Unternehmen (bspw. Zolldienstleister) möglich sein, Informationen je vertretenes Unternehmen anzugeben, um dies nicht umständlich auf Positionsebene einpflegen zu müssen. Dann wäre auch ein separater Bericht pro vertretenes Unternehmen möglich. Der derzeit im Übergangsregister erstellte Bericht enthält abschließend die Informationen aller vertretenen Unternehmen, sodass dieser datenschutzrechtlich nicht an die Vertretenen ausgehändigt werden kann. weitere Punkte s. Anhang",,withinfo,other,medium,closed,33195975,,,"In 2026, CBAM will start real operations. Only registered CBAM declarants can then declare the goods concerned in the customs territory of the EU and allow their import. It is very essential that such a complex reporting obligation as the CBAM has a well-functioning technical reporting tool. The user-friendliness of the portal must be ensured. In particular, experience with the transitional register shall be taken into account. There should be extensive testing possibilities before the start of real-life operations. We would ask you to check whether the new register meets all the requirements that are important for the companies. We have listed them below. The requirements for the CBAM registry from a business perspective are the following (choice): The CBAM registry should be made available in all official languages of the EU. There should be a functional overview version to report data without registration. The error messages should be easy to understand in order to speed up the preparation and submission of CBAM reports. Explanations for input fields should support and simplify the completion. The customs data of the imported CBAM items per importer should be made available directly in the registry based on its EORI number. For this purpose, import data should be made available in advance by the customs administration. The reporting entity then checks, corrects and supplements them, not only after the CBAM report has been uploaded. This would also help to ensure that companies submit full CBAM reports. It is necessary to introduce a practical de minimis rule for small consignments. This can be based on weight, e.g. one tonne or value. For example, for the CBAM system in Great Britain, the de minimis threshold is 50.000 pounds. When entering the data, it should be clear to users whether data has been stored on positions in the system. It should be ensured that data that have been accidentally deleted can be restored. It should be possible to temporarily store data in the system. In the event of system overload or failure, there should be a message on the system side as soon as the system is again stable and further data entry is possible again. It must be possible for companies to download CBAM reports. A system to system connection must be guaranteed so that, in the case of high volumes, individual information is not required. An Excel upload is not sufficient. The Excel upload should be simplified so that evaluations from the well-known customs software applications can easily be completed and fed into. The register should allow for centralised reporting for several parts of the undertaking or sister companies. Unitary CBAM reporting (a CBAM decorator for several parts of the company, subsidiaries, etc.) would in part significantly reduce the administrative burden for larger companies or business groupings. This must also be possible across Member States. At the same time, for representatives of several other undertakings (e.g. Customs service providers) are able to provide information per company represented in order not to be cumbersome to maintain this at position level. A separate report per company represented would then also be possible. The report currently drawn up in the transitional register contains the information of all the companies represented, so that it cannot be handed over to the representatives under data protection law.",22400601191-42

en,3498663,BEL,European Aluminium,MANIGRASSI,PUBLISHED,2024-11-28 16:17:59,False,Ares(2024)7742910,False,Emanuele,"We welcome the European Commissions efforts to develop a framework for the CBAM registry. Nevertheless, certain provisions in the draft Implementing Regulation require revision to improve clarity, operational coherence, and alignment with established frameworks. Firstly, Article 4(2) introduces ambiguity by implying that both the competent authority and other entities may be responsible for communicating decisions on penalties. This phrasing conflicts with Article 26(4) of the CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956, which assigns this responsibility solely to the competent authority. To address this, we recommend amending Article 4(2) to clarify that only the competent authority is responsible for communicating penalty decisions. Secondly, Article 10, which governs the CBAM Operators Portal, requires several clarifications: 1. The article does not explicitly state that the portal applies to operators of installations in third countries, potentially leading to confusion. To resolve this, the text should clearly specify its scope. 2. The phrasing of Article 10(2)(b) allows for potential misinterpretation that operators can register information on goods from installations other than their own. We suggest revising this to specify information on the goods produced by its installation. 3. The draft does not indicate whether the use of the portal is voluntary, leaving operators uncertain about compliance requirements. We recommend explicitly stating that the portals use is voluntary, ensuring flexibility. Next, Article 16 refers to a business continuity plan to address temporary registry failures but provides no details or definitions. This omission leaves stakeholders uninformed about its content or application. To enhance transparency, the legal text should either define the term or outline its components. Furthermore, Article 21 on the confidentiality of data within the CBAM registry raises concerns about transparency and consistency with the EU ETS framework. The CBAM framework designates most registry information as confidential, restricting public access to key data and undermining accountability. In contrast, the ETS Registry, referencing Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, provides transparency through publicly available data on installations, emissions, and free allocations. The CBAM Regulation itself (Article 1(2)) emphasises the need for equivalence with ETS rules. To align with these principles, we recommend: 1. Clearly defining personal data and specifying what information is accessible to authorised CBAM declarants, operators, and other actors. 2. Revising Article 21 to reflect the transparency standards of the ETS Registry, with a reference to Directive 2003/4/EC. 3. Publishing key information, such as contact details of declarants and operators, as well as total emissions and CBAM certificates. Finally, Article 23(1) stipulates a 10-year data retention period, which exceeds the 5-year limit set by Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 during the transitional period. To ensure consistency, we recommend aligning the CBAM registrys data retention period with this 5-year standard. These adjustments will ensure the CBAM registry operates transparently, efficiently, and in harmony with existing regulatory frameworks.

As a truly European company with numerous legal entities across various EU countries, we are currently required to manage a separate Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) for each of our entities that need to comply with the CBAM requirements. This necessitates the appointment of a declarant with access to the CBAM transitional registry for each legal entity, meaning we need around 30 trained staff members to ensure compliance with CBAM requirements across our operations. At present, this situation is resource- and time-intensive, placing a significant administrative burden on our teams. To streamline this process and improve operational efficiency, we recommend introducing the option to allocate multiple EORIs to one declarant within the permanent CBAM registry. By centralizing the process and appointing fewer declarants, we believe companies could simplify internal workflows, enhance the effectiveness of data collection, and ensure stronger governance to comply with the CBAM requirements. This approach would ultimately reduce the administrative load while maintaining the integrity of the regulatory framework.

We consider it important that the final registry can be easily accessible and usable for CBAM declarants. — To that end, all acronyms should be translated into the language in which the register is used. The error messages sent by the register should also indicate which transactions need to be carried out in order to resolve the source of the error (e.g.: indication of the field to be modified, validation of reports in draft or final mode, exclusive boxes – it is now possible to tick in a single profile, the “rapporteur” and “representative” boxes, etc.) – A contact/help desk interface (instant messaging, rdv sockets with a natural person, etc.) should be integrated into the platform to receive assistance or validation of requests from the operator. For example, in order to benefit from a deferred declaration, a deferral number issued by the competent authority is required. However, it is impossible to obtain this number from the register, which prevents the operators concerned from making their declarations. We welcome the possibility for installations to register in the registry for information on carbon emissions. In general, we encourage all functionalities that allow operators established in third countries to engage in CBAM. On the other hand, we still see a reluctance on the part of the latter to share information. Some third party companies even paid for the emissions data to be reported in the quarterly reports.

The association represents the common economic, technical and scientific interests of this unique and diverse industry. VDMA member companies produce many different technological solutions for climate protection and are enablers in the transition to a net-zero economy. However, VDMA believes the CBAM mechanism still needs significant improvement in order to ensure both the competitiveness of European export-oriented companies in the mechanical engineering sector and to attain the desire climate-impact of the CBAM. Considering the authorization of CBAM declarants, our member companies take a cautious view on placing the authorization burden highly on the national authorities considering the lack of administrative support at national level during the first year of CBAM reporting obligations. VDMA encourages the European Commission to support NCAs with CBAM implementation, including mandatory training for the CBAM registry as indicated in Article 17. In more concrete points: 1. For smoother CBAM implementation, VDMA supports that the CBAM declarants test the CBAM registry together with the Member States. This would allow companies to familiarize themselves with the different functions and make suggestions for improvements aiming to accelerate the whole process, while making user-friendly. In this way, current unsuitable functions of the CBAM Portal, such as using Mwh for the energy input, would be avoided minimizing the urge for technical updates bringing new features that need further clarification. The changes at the CBAM portal introduced in October 2024 resulted in significant challenges for companies. In some cases, businesses were required to recreate their reports from scratch, despite the fact the imminent reporting deadline was later that month. This situation underpins the importance of planning and testing technical changes to minimize disruptions and support compliance efforts effectively. 2. Based on feedback from our members regarding Article 19 (Specific role of the Commission and the competent authorities), there is a need for greater clarity on handling challenges, particularly technical issues. This is especially important as CBAM declarants may need to interact with both the Commission and national competent authorities, potentially leading to overlapping responsibilities and added complexity. Clear guidelines on roles and actions are essential to streamline processes and avoid confusion. 3.

Furthermore, the registry offers an opportunity for competent authorities to share the burden of challenging third-country operators when data are missing or lack precision. While these opportunities are promising, CLEPA emphasises the need to address several pressing issues to ensure the CBAM is both effective and manageable. 1. Access to data remains a critical challenge. One of the main challenges in the CBAM is the lack of access to accurate and timely emissions data. A recent survey of CLEPA members revealed that 65% of automotive suppliers receive actual emissions data from less than 10% of their own suppliers. This significant data gap underscores the difficulty of tracking and reporting emissions, particularly for iron and steel products that move through multiple layers of the supply chain. Additional barriers include the inability to switch suppliers due to existing contractual obligations or the need for regulatory approvals, including complex safety certifications. We recommend allowing the use of default or industry-standard emissions values until a substantial portion of suppliers can provide verified data. We further suggest excluding one-time shipments (e.g., for testing purposes) and incorporating provisions for samples and non-recurring deliveries. 2. Administrative burden and compliance costs. The current administrative requirements of CBAM pose substantial challenges. The administrative burden and costs can amount to several hundred thousand euros per reporting period. While the CBAM registry is already a step forward, we recommend the Commission to continue addressing the administrative burden issue. One suggestion would be to streamline the Excel template by focusing on mandatory fields and anticipated future needs (e.g. direct vs. indirect emissions after 2026). To further support compliance, we suggest translating key documents into key partner languages. 3. Proposal for a Weight-Based and CBAM registration Threshold. The current CBAM applies uniform reporting requirements when the value of the shipment is EUR 150 or more. We believe that a weight-based per-shipment threshold would be a more practical and efficient approach. This has proved effective in the risk-based implementation of the REACH regime, where a 1T annual volume threshold excludes compliance requirements for one-off shipments. Higher thresholds would target larger consignments with greater environmental impact, reducing administrative burden. Additionally, an overall customs value threshold, such as the UKs proposed £50,000, combined with a weight-based limit, would ease the reporting burden for low-value, low-impact imports. 4. Allow the company to report for its subsidiaries. The current CBAM poses challenges for multi-subsidiary companies by requiring separate filings tied to each subsidiarys EORI number, even within the same parent company. This increases administrative burden and inefficiencies. Allowing a central filing option, where one entity handles CBAM declarations for all subsidiaries, would streamline compliance, reduce duplication, and better reflect the integrated operations of multinational businesses 5. Allow for Retrospective CBAM registration after import to prevent import blockages. A key forward-looking risk under the current CBAM is that, from 1 January 2026, EU customs authorities will block imports if the importer is not registered as an authorised CBAM declarant. This poses a significant risk to CLEPA members who may need to import CBAM-relevant goods on an ad-hoc basis. Since the CBAM scope includes parts and downstream products essential for machinery, critical goods for automotive, supply chains risk being delayed at the border, causing operational disruption.",,withinfo,business_association,small,closed,33195975,,,,91408765797-03

However, it is essential to ensure that the data reported are accurate to ensure the mechanisms goals are met. One of the main concerns regarding calculating emissions associated with precursor goods in CBAM goods is the risk of over / underpricing carbon emissions due to the lack of appropriate data and the use of methodologies, which have proven problematic. If one of the main goals of the CBAM scheme is to align the ETS requirements with CBAM goods, the scheme should take into account a different carbon pricing for goods produced that emitted emissions with a higher biogenic content. This would ensure that a comparable carbon price is paid on imported emissions and domestic emissions and is applied fairly to EU imports in line with the WTO obligations. One of the main requirements of the EU ETS is direct C-14 testing following ISO EN 13833, ISO 18466 or ASTM D6866 for stationary source emissions seeking to claim biogenic content. Hence, we recommend that the mechanism should include provisions about carbon pricing for emissions with a higher biogenic content. More specifically, the CBAM certificates within the CBAM registry seeking the recognition of biogenic content must be issued following direct testing following recognized scientific standards such as ASTM D6866 Method B, BS EN ISO 21644 Annex A, and ISO 13833 Annex A. One of the main goals of the EU CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and align international companies' obligations with EU companies obligations. To do so, the emissions produced by CBAM goods must be determined accurately, especially as calculation methodologies have proven to be misused in many countries outside of the EU to artificially increase the biogenic content of products. In this regard, the only reliable method to accurately determine the biogenic content of the emissions is the Carbon-14 methodology.",,withinfo,other,small,closed,33195975,,,,

However, it has been observed that the details regarding the scope of the portal are not clear in the draft text. In particular, it is unclear whether the institutions (raw material suppliers) that perform embedded emission calculations are included in this scope.

Difficulty of the Process and Adaptation: The obligations brought by CBAM require a difficult process for all stakeholders in the sector, both technically and operationally. In particular, it will not be easy for the CBAM Operators Portal to be used effectively and for all stakeholders to adapt to the process quickly. Therefore, we would like to emphasize that additional support mechanisms (e.g. guidance documents, training programs, technical support lines) should be provided during the implementation process. 3.Product-Specific Processes and Emissions Data: The manufacturing processes for our products can vary significantly based on customer-specific requirements, resulting in different carbon calculations for various product types. In the online declaration system, emissions data for multiple product types will be reported and shared centrally. In this context, it remains unclear whether customers will be expected to independently select the appropriate emissions data for their specific products or whether we, as suppliers, will have the ability to directly provide and share the precise emissions values relevant to each customers product. The success of CBAM can only be achieved with accurate and reliable emission calculations.

The draft Regulation offers a critical opportunity to reflect on the design and functionality of the electronic infrastructure necessary for the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). While it is essential to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive business information, a high level of transparency in the CBAM Registry is crucial for public scrutiny and input. This transparency can lead to more robust and well-considered policies. We have serious concerns about the expected lack of transparency in the CBAM Registry, especially when compared to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Registry. The current CBAM legal framework, particularly article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956, effectively deems all information in the CBAM Registry as confidential. The Commission would only publish an annual report on total aggregated emissions by CBAM goods. In contrast, the EU ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013 (Annex IX) provides public access to most relevant information, including contact details of European installations and details on total emissions and free allocation for each installation. This high level of transparency is linked to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, which is explicitly referenced in the ETS Registry Regulation. However, no such reference is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation. We urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and review the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation during the 2025 revision. It is essential to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry. For instance, this consistency requires that contact details of CBAM declarants and third-country operators, as well as total emissions and total available CBAM certificates for each of them, are made publicly accessible.",,withinfo,business_association,micro,closed,33195975,,,,890804512955-21

In this consultation, we would like to raise the following points: 1. Fecc supports the legislative initiative and appreciates the flexibility of the reporting requirements. According to the proposal, these requirements should be limited to what is necessary to minimise the burden on importers during the transitional period and facilitate the smooth roll-out of the CBAM declaration requirements after the transitional period. 2. The CBAM adds an additional administrative burden to companies importing goods into the EU. Additional costs are added to the price of the products, which leads to a reduction in market attractiveness and competitiveness. o Currently, it is not necessary to have a Certificate of Origin when importing goods into the EU. The process of acquiring such a document can take time and lead to additional costs. o It is also worth considering the burden on enterprises during the preparation and submission of information to the new reporting form. Especially since the dedicated IT tools mentioned in the proposal are still under development and require additional training and guidance materials for those who will use them. 3. The data submitted according to CBAM can fluctuate, which can be perceived as intentional or negligent behaviour by the reporting declarant. According to the proposal, new reporting requires changes in the calculations of emission factors, basing them on quantity data, while the vast majority of non-EU countries still use invoice value for this purpose. The required changes will lead not only to inaccurate data because this indicator (net mass) is harder to obtain and maintain, but also will require third countries to change their systems in customs and accompanying documentation. Fecc is the association that represents chemical, food, and active pharmaceutical ingredients distributors, most of which are SMEs.

It should be possible for external CBAM tools used by declarants to create CBAM declarations (and manage CBAM obligations) to submit these to the Registry using an API connection, rather than manual xml uploads. Many importers have CBAM obligations across multiple EORI numbers, and connecting their CBAM tool directly to the Registry would seriously reduce manual workload. This connectivity should extend to follow-up communications and status messages as well as any future communication regarding the number of CBAM Certificates held on a quarterly basis. 2. Emissions Database (Art. 10). The Operators database should be an open access database, accessible via a secure API. In a recent update on the TAXUD website it was suggested the data provided by Operators would only be accessible to Importers in the process of creating the CBAM Declaration within the Registry itself. Since many importers create their CBAM report in dedicated systems then upload to the Registry, the emissions data should be available to these systems as well. Currently, the XML upload process in the Transitional Registry requires the emissions data to be completely populated, otherwise the XML is rejected in its entirety. If emissions data stored in the Operators database within the Registry is only accessible when manually creating the Declaration in the Registry itself, the XML upload process is effectively cut off. Furthermore, there are also multiple upstream uses of this data, such as strategic sourcing decisions as well as simplifying the process of determining which suppliers need to be individually approached for data by the Importer. Hiding this data until the CBAM declaration process after year-end is an underutilization of this critical data. 3. Test Environment - Software providers should be given access to a test environment of the Registry. This was not the case for the Transitional Registry, complicating development of the XML message for upload and requiring software makers to use live environments of their customers for testing. 4. Helpdesk - There should be a dedicated Registry technical helpdesk on EU Commission level. The current set up whereby technical questions need to be raised via national helpdesks leads to delays in communication and misunderstandings. 5. Software working group - We would welcome the creation of a working group of software makers in the CBAM space, to provide feedback on development of the Registry and its interoperability with 3rd party software. This is commonplace on national level, in the Customs space and is mutually beneficial in supporting importers to be compliant effectively and efficiently.

Suggestion would be made that operators and installations would need to add and update their own information in the Cbam administration where they receive a unique Cbam relation nr. This relation nr can be ventilated in onwards trading documents, f.e. invoices, where EU importers/Ind customs reps can use these for adding info in the Cbam register. Item 2 Same as above, operators and installations could add their carbon exhaust figures on their productions in the Cbam register already. Herewith importers and EU importers/Ind customs reps are able to re-use these data for filing the Cbam report, where they just add importation figures. Item 3 Would suggest for adding info into the Cbam report a simple excel upload would need to be used to prevent manual input at highest level. Item 4 Would suggest an indirect customs representative would get a different status for being liable and responsible for adding information in the Cbam register. A declarant receives its info from its business partners and customers and should not be held liable if the data is being reused in Cbam. Item 5 Currently when data is entered in the Cbam register it is not working very logical. When data is added in chronological entry, the view in the Cbam changes (and concept report) changes each time when information is being added. The Cbam program should hold the chronological entry of the importer or declarant.

We, as Ford Otosan, have 2 manufacture plants which circulating goods to feed the manufacture lines in Turkey and Romania. Since Turkey is not in European Union it considered as we are importing products from a 3rd country during our import operations to Craiova plant. We have racks in scope of regulation which named as CBAM goods. Please see below more details about mentioned racks; -These racks are using only for packaging material to carry the actual products in themselves from Turkey to Romania. -Mentioned racks also dont have any commercial value and manufactured in past 2-10 years ago. -We dont manufacture new racks, but we use what we already have. (no additional manufacturing for racks for at least for 2 years) What we have problem about, the legislation indicates that if the CBAM good imported from a 3rd country (in our case from Turkey plant to Romania plant) the importer will face certain amount of certificate cost in tonne basis. However; -Non of the mentioned racks are new-produced so none of them leading further CO2 emission. -Ford Otosan Romania/Turkey use exact same rack during in&out processes which means we dont produce new racks each time. We use racks as packaging material with the ones we already have. Ford Otosan believes the commission thought notice that such scenario might occurs, and they developed a solution for companies as Ford Otosan. The regulation indicates if the companies declared the packaging materials (in our case it is rack) as they will remain in EU borders temporarily, they wont face any certificate cost. We, as Ford Otosan, planned to implement this suggestion however we cant link the physical operation to an ERP tracking system. The reason is, if the importer decides to use Temporary Admission to declare the goods wont remain in EU permanently the importer must link the temporary imported goods and their return to each other in order to report/declare it to the custom authority. Our racks have some numbers on themselves, but it is completely random and not all of them have mentioned numbers and the reason for them is we already had produced the racks way before the regulation was published. In addition, our racks are on common usage which means all of Ford Otosan Romania's suppliers have racks in their inventory and using them as packaging material for each shipment. Ford Otosan, calculated approximately cost with the current volume, will face certificate cost and will face higher costs in coming years although Ford Otosan doesnt lead CO2 emission and using the CBAM goods temporarily in EU borders. Ford Otosan, aims to invest more capabilities, employ more people, expand the manufacture line in our Romania plant however it is likely the total budget will cut by some share to cover CBAM certificate cost. It seems as only solution for Ford Otosan, is to implement the Temporary Admission as it is in Turkey which is based on total sum quantity, not based on labelling the good or a number for each item which is the subject of temporary admission. We kindly ask your feedback upon this inquiry and implementation of solution as more convenient way for Ford Otosan Romania. Thank you.",,anonymous,business_association,large,closed,33195975,,,,

This can't be any further removed from the truth, as the common practice of most Undertakings is to use ""generic"" tariff codes (i.e. ""parts of..."") instead of the correct ones. DG Taxud and competent Authorities of the Member States should start looking into the SAD using generic Tariff Codes (i.e. ""Parts of Air-Conditioning"" - 8415900099) and it will be easily spotted that screws, washers, bolts made of iron, steel, cast iron and aluminum panels (in scope of the CBAM Regulation) are incorrectly placed on the Market and therefore not included in the CBAM quarterly reporting. I invite DG Taxud and local Member State Authorities to take these these actions: 1. Break down these Generic Tariff Codes into [DG Taxud]: - ""Parts of ..... made of iron, steel, aluminum"" [in scope of CBAM Regulation] - ""Other parts of ..... NOT made of iron, steel aluminum"" [NOT in scope of CBAM Regulation] 2. Check the imports from October the 1st 2023 of these Generic Tariff Codes (i.e. 8415900099). I suspect the findings will be very interesting and will have also implications related to Regulation (EU) 573/2024 (the F-GAS Regulation). Another relevant topic is the ""Manufacturer Information"". There is a lot of confusion in affected sectors, as the ""Manufacturer"" is very often confused with the ""Vendor"". And likewise, the ""Country of Origin"" (were the goods are actually made) is confused with the ""Country of Shipping"" (Country from where the goods are shipped). Without levelling the playing field by securing that all Undertakings comply with the Customs Code of the Union in first instance, which would lead then to the correct application of the CBAM (and other environmental Regulations), there will always be a commercial disadvantage (Carbon Credit cost) for the law abiding Undertakings. If this is not done during the transition phase, any subsequent development of the CBAM Regulation will be hindered by the incorrect Customs procedures (by not using the right Tariff codes, CBAM obligations are eluded) currently in place. Truth to be told, this should have been done before implementing the Regulation. With these business operating standards (incorrect Tariff Code, incorrect Manufacturer information), after the illegal trade of refrigerants caused by the F-GAS Regulation and its lack of controls in its second release (Regulation EU 517/2014), there will be the avoidance of CBAM Regulation by exploiting the lack of market survey by competent Authorities.
