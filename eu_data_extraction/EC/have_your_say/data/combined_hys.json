Our members account for more than €500 billion in annual turnover, as well as for millions of jobs across the EU. We support the goal of the European Union to fight climate change and make Europe the most sustainable economy globally. To achieve those goals, it is essential to put in place policies which strengthen the Union’s manufacturing industry and keep EU manufacturing value chains competitive.\nWe ask the Commission to consider the points expressed below in designing a proposal for any CBA mechanism. As a preliminary comment, and in the light of the current health and sanitary emergency and the economic crisis that will follow in the EU, it will be essential to adapt decarbonisation policies to the new context, in particular to avoid the collapse of productive systems and social cohesion throughout the EU.\n1. Fundamentally, a CBA mechanism must be designed so as to contribute to the objective of decarbonisation in the EU by strengthening and completing existing measures protecting European industries from the risk of “carbon leakage”, or the risk of relocation of manufacturing and investment. Accordingly, free allocations should be maintained as a complement to border measures to avoid all forms of carbon leakage. On the other hand, it must be recognised that for some sectors, CBAs may not be appropriate and complementary measures in addition to free allocations and indirect costs compensation should be considered. The underlying aim is to ensure the equal treatment of all products placed on the EU market with regard to the limitations and costs of decarbonisation measures.\nThe CBA mechanism must in principle apply regardless of the country from which a product is imported. For example, the CBA must apply to products from a given country regardless of the preferential status of that country under EU legislation and/or the designation of that country as a developing country by a multilateral institution. The CBA mechanism must reflect the cap or limitation on EU carbon emissions as well as the costs for those emissions which are permitted. A carbon border mechanism must not replace, and a priori any transitional period of CBA application must not endanger, existing direct and indirect EU carbon leakage measures, including ETS free allowances and indirect costs compensation.\n2. This implies that:\ne A CBA mechanism designed in this manner can then provide strong incentives for third countries to decarbonise local manufacturing, and reach a common approach with the EU on carbon pricing and related issue.\ne A CBA mechanism must not only consider the carbon footprint of imports but also reflect the overall carbon footprint of making those or similar products in the places where the essential manufacturing steps take place. Thus, while a CBA mechanism must in principle be based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products, i.e. not a simple average benchmark or ad valorem, other policies may be relevant in setting the carbon cost to be imposed on imports.\nMeasuring the carbon footprint of imports and reflecting the total manufacturing emissions in the places where the essential manufacturing steps take place requires a proper and efficient system of measurement, with incentives and sanctions to maximise the cooperation of importers and their third country suppliers. In cases where data is not made available in a timely and complete manner, or cooperation is otherwise materially deficient, default values should be used which do not allow an opportunity for free-riding. The general acceptance of on-site verification visits at the places where essential manufacturing steps take place must be considered a fundamental requirement for cooperation.\nWhile full carbon accounting should, in principle, ultimately cover the entire value chain,\nupstream and downstream, from the primary raw materials and other inputs (including\nenergy) down to final end products, and include transport to the EU port of final destination,\na transitional approach with a border measure focused on the most carbon-intensive steps is\na practicable starting point. Full carbon accounting in turn will require a robust analysis of\nthe whole supply chain for each sector to capture sectorial specificities and needs, especially\nduring any transitional period.\nA CBA mechanism must provide for appropriate and efficient cost adjustments to address trade flow manipulations such as source shifting and CBA absorption. This is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of a CBA in tackling carbon leakage.\nAny steps taken to simplify measurements must not significantly increase the risk of CBA\navoidance. In addition, the CBA mechanism must provide sufficient scope for adjustments to\naddress any inadequacy that arises or becomes evident after implementation.\nTo have a coherent focus on products placed on the EU market and to ensure proper\nincentives for third countries to reach a common approach with the EU on carbon pricing,\nany CBA should not result in the impairment of the competitiveness of EU exports to third\ncountries.\n3. While the minimisation of additional administrative burdens is important, an effective CBA mechanism requires a legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions in the production of the affected products.\n4. Also, while CBA enforcement would naturally be entrusted to Member States, there need to be sufficiently detailed rules at EU level to ensure the availability of timely information and the application of effective and dissuasive Member State measures to penalise avoidance.\n5. Throughout the process of putting in place a comprehensive CBA mechanism, transparency and close dialogue with trading partners will be important. However, the EU must not be held hostage to delays in finding agreement before putting in place a fully functioning CBA mechanism. In addition, the EU must:\nbe prepared to defend fully its CBA mechanism under existing international agreements, including the WTO Agreements, without backing down in the face of unilateral pressures from third countries; not revise the CBA mechanism in the context of agreement on bilateral or multilateral instruments that are only meant to support “green” technologies/products (e.g. Environmental Goods Agreement) or achieve other aims besides comprehensive and effective carbon pricing across borders; ensure that third country carbon pricing and limitation arrangements are effectively implemented, and compatible with EU arrangements (i.e. impose similar costs and limitations for a similar carbon footprint in a given sector), before agreeing to make any linkages with the systems of those third countries.\n6. To be coherent with the objective of the CBA, and EU climate policy objectives in general, funds raised from the CBA should be used primarily to encourage research and innovation in carbon- reducing technologies related to manufacturing and facilitate their application in the EU.\n7. The upcoming CBA impact assessment should be an integral part of a broader discussion between the EU institutions and all the stakeholders potentially concerned. In particular, the design of a CBA proposal should not be detached from the discussion and implementation of the New Industrial Strategy for Europe. At the same time, the elaboration of a CBA proposal should not pre-empt the strengthening and development of other EU policy instruments which can contribute to mitigating the risk of carbon leakage through a fair level playing field in relation to the many environment- or health and safety-related costs borne by the EU manufacturing sector but not fully by producers outside the EU."

        "pdf_text": "We connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\n#BSP_Paper April 2020\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n1 Introduction\nThe document below is an attempt to draw preliminary conclusions on the concept of an EU-level adjustment mechanism on imports of products whose manufacturing process is accompanied by carbon dioxide emission (\"Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\", CBAM). It is based on the input of three sectors of the Polish economy associated in Business & Science Poland, namely fertilisers, fuel-refinery and non-ferrous metal production.\nFrom the perspective of the above-mentioned sectors, introduction of CBAM at EU level is justified due to the need for support of the EU’s efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions. Lack of burden-sharing for the imported goods with a cost equivalent to that borne by the European industry means that non- European producers are not motivated to undertake pro-climatic efforts. This is counter-productive to the EU actions on environmental issues and furthermore poses a threat to the development of industry and jobs preservation in the EU?.\nThe introduction of CBAM will serve the following purposes:\n— will be an incentive to reduce the carbon footprint by the non-EU producers, — reduce the incentive to relocate the EU industry under pressure of climate costs in the EU, — restore the competitive balance of European energy-intensive industries vis-a-vis producers outside the EU.\nPossible form of CBAM\nSectoral approach\nDue to the innovative nature of this instrument, CBAM should be introduced gradually and on sector- by-sector basis.\nDuring the testing phase of this concept, the system should be simple and easy to use, and the risk of retaliation should be minimised. These criteria are primarily met by the fertilizer sector which could, therefore, be covered by CBAM in its first phase. The following are in favour of covering the fertiliser sector:\n— Easy calculation of the carbon footprint in the product — Significant imports into the EU and small exports outside the EU — Alimited number of exporters to the EU, which would facilitate the system management.\nThe fuel sector? would also be a beneficiary of CBAM. In addition, sector-specific market access regulations would facilitate the management of the system (see further below).\n1 According Carbon-Cap.eu, emissions generated within the EU fell by 13% between 1990 and 2010, but the actual EU to carbon footprint increased by 8%. Many EU countries are net importers of carbon present in the end products. * would be preferable only the diesel market for CBAM, the European fuel is diesel importer. It to cover as sector a net Gasoline imports to the EU are small while exports are significant.\nPage 1 of 3\n+ 32 487 24 58 58 info@zpbsp.com Rue Belliard 40, 1000 Brussels Ksiazeca 4, 00-498 Warsaw www.zpbsp.com\nEU Transparency Register Number: 548212735276-89\nBUSINESS & SCIENCE\nPOLAND\nBSP\nWe connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\nThe non-ferrous metal production sector should not be included in the CBAM pilot phase. This is due to two factors:\n— the pro-export nature of this activity and the related possibility of retaliation, — challenges regarding the need to include also indirect emissions in the CBAM, i.e. those generated in the production of electricity, which is an important cost element for this sector.\n3. Border Fee\nThe fee resulting from CBAM should apply when the foreign product is admitted to the EU market, i.e. at the moment of importation. The importer under the customs procedure has the necessary information needed to determine the amount of any CBAM fee: name of the goods, customs code, as well as the manufacturer and the country of origin.\nIn the case of the fuel sector, this solution can be modified. Due to the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), admission to the market of the imported fuel as well as the EU-produced fuel takes place under the strict supervision of the market regulator or tax administration. This enables efficient charging of fees under the existing fuel admission system.\nThe collection of fees at this point for both EU and imported fuels would also enable the introduction of more far-reaching solutions, i.e. the transfer of the carbon footprint fee from the production process (as currently assumed by the ETS) to the level of fuel consumption.\nThe preferred solution, however, is to introduce an additional fee at the border (or at another entry point to the market), rather than extending the existing ETS to imports as well. If ETS would include the imported goods, the demand for allowances will increase sharply and increase prices to the unbearable levels. This would imply the need to increase the amount of emission allowances and would politically complicate the process.\nThe amount of the fee should take into account:\n— the difference between the product's carbon footprint in the EU (determined on the basis of the ETS reference point) and the country of origin of the imported product, — the average price of the EU emission allowance.\nETS generates the cost per ton of a given product manufactured in the EU according to the formula: carbon footprint in a product x price of emission allowance?. As a rule, a similar cost should be charged to the imported product.\n4. Basis and individual rate\nIn this way, the basic fee for a given product from a given country would be calculated and automatically updated and charged at the border.\nDue to the WTO requirements, the border fee cannot be discriminatory. Therefore, the system should provide for the possibility of adapting the fee as much as possible to the specific level of emissions of\nthe imported product and the possibility for the individual exporter to show that it is:\n— lower than the adopted reference point in the EU, — lower than the one adopted generally or for a given country.\n3 The of emission allowances is evolving, therefore, of several months should be used. This would imply cost an average an analogy to the anti-dumping system which allows the calculation of the duty rate based on historical data.\nPage 2 of 3\n+ 32 487 24 58 58 info@zpbsp.com Rue Belliard 40, 1000 Brussels Ksiazeca 4, 00-498 Warsaw www.zpbsp.com\nEU Transparency Register Number: 548212735276-89\nBUSINESS & SCIENCE\nPOLAND\nBSP\nWe connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\nThe fee set in this way would be individual. A similar solution occurs under the system of anti-dumping and countervailing measures.\nThe individual rate should be calculated according to the same formula as the EU reference point: carbon footprint x average EU emission price (in the chosen period).\n5. Existing tools and CBAM\nThere is an argument in the discussion that as a consequence of the introduction of CBAM, it is necessary to eliminate the existing instruments preventing carbon leakage (ETS free allowances, compensation for indirect emissions).\nIn our view the conditionality \"CBAM\" or \"existing instruments\" is flawed.\n— CBAM’s aim is to incorporate imports into climate policy. This is the only instrument responding to the problem of the EU's carbon footprint related to imports. CBAM is a new concept which requires testing and a pilot approach. Replacing the proven instruments with an unverified one would be irresponsible towards the EU industry and provoke resistance - to the detriment of the EU climate policy. Further, free ETS allowances and compensation for indirect emissions seem to be the only WTO compliant instrument to counteract the loss of competitiveness of the European industry on export markets, where competitors are not burdened with the cost of climate policies. CBAM will not address this problem. In designing a CBAM, it is also imperative to take into account the costs of indirect emissions, i.e. those resulting from the use of electricity in industrial processes imposed by the ETS costs.\n6 Summary\nThe CBAM system outlined as above would create market incentives for importing low-carbon products into the EU and wold be an economic incentive to reduce emissions worldwide. In addition, due to the possibility of obtaining a lower rate adequate to the individual emission level, the system will force exporters to strive for some form of confirmation by the EU that their emission level is below the EU reference point. Such a \"certification\" system would be the first step to introduce the EU ETS to EU trading partners. If companies from these countries are already \"certified\" in the ETS, the barrier of introducing a similar system in that country will decrease.\nAbout BSP\nBusiness and Science Poland (BSP) connects the experience of leading Polish enterprises with the EU agenda.

This includes the system of free allowances that provides the key stimulus for industry installations under the EU ETS to be amongst the best in class and the compensation of indirect ETS costs.

This is counter-productive to the EU actions on environmental issues and furthermore poses a threat to the development of industry and jobs preservation in the EU?.\nThe introduction of CBAM will serve the following purposes:\n— will be an incentive to reduce the carbon footprint by the non-EU producers, — reduce the incentive to relocate the EU industry under pressure of climate costs in the EU, — restore the competitive balance of European energy-intensive industries vis-a-vis producers outside the EU.\nPossible form of CBAM\nSectoral approach\nDue to the innovative nature of this instrument, CBAM should be introduced gradually and on sector- by-sector basis.\nDuring the testing phase of this concept, the system should be simple and easy to use, and the risk of retaliation should be minimised. These criteria are primarily met by the fertilizer sector which could, therefore, be covered by CBAM in its first phase. The following are in favour of covering the fertiliser sector:\n— Easy calculation of the carbon footprint in the product — Significant imports into the EU and small exports outside the EU — Alimited number of exporters to the EU, which would facilitate the system management.\nThe fuel sector? would also be a beneficiary of CBAM. In addition, sector-specific market access regulations would facilitate the management of the system (see further below).\n1 According Carbon-Cap.eu, emissions generated within the EU fell by 13% between 1990 and 2010, but the actual EU to carbon footprint increased by 8%. Many EU countries are net importers of carbon present in the end products. * would be preferable only the diesel market for CBAM, the European fuel is diesel importer. It to cover as sector a net Gasoline imports to the EU are small while exports are significant.\nPage 1 of 3\n+ 32 487 24 58 58 info@zpbsp.com Rue Belliard 40, 1000 Brussels Ksiazeca 4, 00-498 Warsaw www.zpbsp.com\nEU Transparency Register Number: 548212735276-89\nBUSINESS & SCIENCE\nPOLAND\nBSP\nWe connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\nThe non-ferrous metal production sector should not be included in the CBAM pilot phase. This is due to two factors:\n— the pro-export nature of this activity and the related possibility of retaliation, — challenges regarding the need to include also indirect emissions in the CBAM, i.e. those generated in the production of electricity, which is an important cost element for this sector.\n3. Border Fee\nThe fee resulting from CBAM should apply when the foreign product is admitted to the EU market, i.e. at the moment of importation. The importer under the customs procedure has the necessary information needed to determine the amount of any CBAM fee: name of the goods, customs code, as well as the manufacturer and the country of origin.\nIn the case of the fuel sector, this solution can be modified. Due to the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), admission to the market of the imported fuel as well as the EU-produced fuel takes place under the strict supervision of the market regulator or tax administration. This enables efficient charging of fees under the existing fuel admission system.\nThe collection of fees at this point for both EU and imported fuels would also enable the introduction of more far-reaching solutions, i.e. the transfer of the carbon footprint fee from the production process (as currently assumed by the ETS) to the level of fuel consumption.\nThe preferred solution, however, is to introduce an additional fee at the border (or at another entry point to the market), rather than extending the existing ETS to imports as well. If ETS would include the imported goods, the demand for allowances will increase sharply and increase prices to the unbearable levels. This would imply the need to increase the amount of emission allowances and would politically complicate the process.\nThe amount of the fee should take into account:\n— the difference between the product's carbon footprint in the EU (determined on the basis of the ETS reference point) and the country of origin of the imported product, — the average price of the EU emission allowance.\nETS generates the cost per ton of a given product manufactured in the EU according to the formula: carbon footprint in a product x price of emission allowance?. As a rule, a similar cost should be charged to the imported product.\n4. Basis and individual rate\nIn this way, the basic fee for a given product from a given country would be calculated and automatically updated and charged at the border.\nDue to the WTO requirements, the border fee cannot be discriminatory. Therefore, the system should provide for the possibility of adapting the fee as much as possible to the specific level of emissions of\nthe imported product and the possibility for the individual exporter to show that it is:\n— lower than the adopted reference point in the EU, — lower than the one adopted generally or for a given country.\n3 The of emission allowances is evolving, therefore, of several months should be used. This would imply cost an average an analogy to the anti-dumping system which allows the calculation of the duty rate based on historical data.\nPage 2 of 3\n+ 32 487 24 58 58 info@zpbsp.com Rue Belliard 40, 1000 Brussels Ksiazeca 4, 00-498 Warsaw www.zpbsp.com\nEU Transparency Register Number: 548212735276-89\nBUSINESS & SCIENCE\nPOLAND\nBSP\nWe connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\nThe fee set in this way would be individual. A similar solution occurs under the system of anti-dumping and countervailing measures.\nThe individual rate should be calculated according to the same formula as the EU reference point: carbon footprint x average EU emission price (in the chosen period).\n5. Existing tools and CBAM\nThere is an argument in the discussion that as a consequence of the introduction of CBAM, it is necessary to eliminate the existing instruments preventing carbon leakage (ETS free allowances, compensation for indirect emissions).\nIn our view the conditionality \"CBAM\" or \"existing instruments\" is flawed.\n— CBAM’s aim is to incorporate imports into climate policy. This is the only instrument responding to the problem of the EU's carbon footprint related to imports. CBAM is a new concept which requires testing and a pilot approach. Replacing the proven instruments with an unverified one would be irresponsible towards the EU industry and provoke resistance - to the detriment of the EU climate policy. Further, free ETS allowances and compensation for indirect emissions seem to be the only WTO compliant instrument to counteract the loss of competitiveness of the European industry on export markets, where competitors are not burdened with the cost of climate policies. CBAM will not address this problem. In designing a CBAM, it is also imperative to take into account the costs of indirect emissions, i.e. those resulting from the use of electricity in industrial processes imposed by the ETS costs.\n6 Summary\nThe CBAM system outlined as above would create market incentives for importing low-carbon products into the EU and wold be an economic incentive to reduce emissions worldwide. In addition, due to the possibility of obtaining a lower rate adequate to the individual emission level, the system will force exporters to strive for some form of confirmation by the EU that their emission level is below the EU reference point. Such a \"certification\" system would be the first step to introduce the EU ETS to EU trading partners. If companies from these countries are already \"certified\" in the ETS, the barrier of introducing a similar system in that country will decrease.\nAbout BSP\nBusiness and Science Poland (BSP) connects the experience of leading Polish enterprises with the EU agenda.

Therefore, more ambitious climate policy measures put a lot of stress on those who use more energy and produce more carbon intensive goods.\nWe should remember that a responsible approach to energy transition also requires designing measures within industrial policy supporting competitiveness and adjustment of the European energy-intensive industry. The energy transition is to be implemented in a highly competitive international environment where jobs offshoring and carbon leakage are real problems. These must be addressed by combining political and economic tools, including an appropriate trade policy.\nThe transition towards a carbon neutral economy is already a huge challenge for companies in Central Europe region. It would be extremely hard for them to compete with non-European companies, which do not take part in the transition processes. The risk of carbon leakage is bigger, in the light of the plans to increase the emission reduction targets for 2030.\nCEEP is in principle in favour of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism which shall create the level playing field for European and non-European producers. Taking into account the increased climate ambitions announced in the European Green Deal but also the process of recovery of the European economies following the COVID-19 outbreak, the equal treatment of EU and non-EU companies is of utmost importance for maintaining the production and proper functioning of European industry.\nIn this regard, the EU should strive to achieve a level playing field for undertakings producing goods (i.e. fertilizers) or generating electricity within the EU and those from outside of the Union. Third countries regulatory regimes may foresee lower environmental and safety standards than those in the EU, which sometimes may be reflected in marginally lower\nes\nO\nCEEP\nCentral Europe Energy Partners\nelectricity or product prices. It is particularly true in the EU neighborhood where there are a lack of a carbon markets and lower enivironemental standards.\nDesigning the CBAM, the European Commission should bear in mind that this kind of mechanism cannot replace the current ETS system and the carbon leakage tools that are functioning, including free allowances and indirect costs compensation. CBAM can be operational as an additional element which supports domestic producers and protect them from an unfair competition from outside. Recent years has shown that the increase of prices of ETS allowances but also the increasing lack of allowances in certain sectors, has in consequence led to the higher costs of production and lowering the competitiveness in the global market.\nCBAM as a completely new instrument in the EU policies, should be thoroughly assessed by the in-depth impact assessment, broad discussion with stakeholders, including which sectors should come first, its compatibility with international trade agreements and WTO rules. It should be also introduced gradually with relevant diplomatic efforts on the global scene.\nA mechanism such as CBAM would ensure a level playing field for European and non-European producers and could normalise the situation and prevent carbon leakage. Especially the carbon content issue should be addressed in an efficient way. Only, if third countries are cooperating in the effort to reduce GHG emissions, our European actions make sense. CBAM should therefore incentivise trade partners to strengthen their own climate efforts. Otherwise it would create a hostile environment in trade relations\nAssuming the increase of EU climate ambitions — there is a need to protect EU industrial competitiveness and to introduce relevant measures\nO\na —) —\nCentral Europe Energy Partners"

Our current membership of 27,000 companies ranges from small family-owned businesses to multinational companies in all industrial sectors.\nNHO strongly support the Paris agreement and the European vison of net-zero emission by 2050 and 1.5-degree policies. \nInternational trade and competition\n\nA sensitive balance must be found on how to use trade as leverage for climate goals while not scaling back on the economic purpose of the trade agenda. Market integration is the core of what the EU/EEA is all about, peace through trade.\n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) requires serious consideration of feasibility, costs and risk. It is NHOs primary opinion that a CBAM should be considered as a last resort, if all other measures to mitigate carbon leakage for European business fail. A CBAM which is fit-for-purpose must be designed carefully and precisely in order to mitigate the risk of retaliation from large trade partners. \nIdeally, the move towards climate neutrality by economies should include the introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms worldwide. International business supports the net-zero vision but see little realism in this target without international carbon markets.\n\nAlternatives to CBAM acceptable under current WTO regime, such as environmental standards, product declarations, labelling and the use of life-cycle assessments must not be underestimated as tools of competitiveness keeping production in Europe. The disclosure of production processes underlines and supports Europe's green competitive edge and if enforced in procurement would greatly lower imports of competing goods with more environmental footprint. \n\nCBAM design \nIn order to implement CBAM one need a system to determine carbon content. That implies full transparency about of origin(s) and content(s) in all products, including recycled content and a legitimate system to calculate content and disclose emissions of production. Hence, the taxation must be based on the carbon content of primary and secondary production including both direct and indirect CO2-emissions along the whole value chain. Consequently, the design of a CBAM will be challenging and subject to many uncertainties although critical in order to ensure that the measure is fit-for-purpose and safeguarding against the risk of retaliation from trade partners. \n\nFor NHO the following principles are imperative for a CBAM to contribute to EU ambitions of combing climate action with value creation: \n\n-\tA CBAM design must be WTO-compliant, to safeguard against the risk of retaliatory measures from major trading partners harming European business and industry's global competitiveness.\n\n-\tA CBAM must be fully functional and compatible with EU ETS, and must not in any way weaken our well-functioning climate market. \n\n-\tIt is imperative that a CBAM is based on a finely tuned system to determine carbon content. This implies full transparency about of origin(s) and content(s) in all products, including recycled content and a legitimate system to calculate content and disclose emissions of production. \n\n-\tTaxation must be based on the carbon content of primary and secondary production including both direct and indirect CO2-emissions along the whole value chain. \n\nRevenue from CBAM should be recycled back to business and industry, financing sustainability improvements which support the ambitions of EU climate policy, much like the principles of the Innovation Fund. \n\n\n\n",

As referenced in the “Carbon border adjustment mechanism Inception Impact Assessment” it is essential that the application is FAIR.  \n\nIf a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)  is to be implemented, the EU must ensure that importers are not paying more for carbon in comparison to local manufacturers.\n\nIf the CBAM is to be introduced alongside the EU ETS then the CBAM must be adjusted so the total price of carbon per tonne is not any higher than the local producer (competitor) is paying averaged over his total production including any credits (EU ETS) he receives.\n\nPlease see below a worked example \n\n•\tEU ETS Credit 400,000 Tonnes \n•\tPlant production = 500,000 Tonnes\n•\tCost of Carbon to Plant = 100,000 Tonnes by 20 Euro = 2,000,000 Euro\n\tAvg cost of carbon per tonne of clinker produced = 2,000,000 / 500,000 = 4 Euro per tonne\n\n\nA FAIR CBAM may be calculated as follows so the importer also pays a total of 4 Euro per tonne of a carbon tax .\n\nScenario 1, No carbon paid in source country which is outside the EU ETS\n•\tImporter pays 4 Euro per tonne CBAM which is the same cost of carbon per tonne as the local producer pays as calculated above\n\nScenario 2 , If carbon is paid in source country which is outside the EU ETS\n•\tCost of clinker (sourced outside the EU) = 100 Euro per tonne.(this includes 2 Euro per tonne Carbon levy or tax or similar paid in source country.\nIf we use the total cost of carbon to be 4 Euro ( which is equal to the average cost the local producer pays for carbon in the example above)\nThen the CBAM paid at point of entry to the EU should be 2 Euro so the total cost of Carbon on the imported clinker is 2 Euro (CBAM)  + 2 Euro (Carbon paid by producer in source country) = 4 euro and this is equal to what the local producer / competitor pays.\n\n•\tIn order for the system to be FAIR and encourage all nations to properly account for carbon it is important that any carbon paid on the product outside the EU should be taken into consideration and be calculated as part of the CBAM.

This work was concluded at the end of 2019, and we are now heavily involved in the work coordinated by DG Grow, on developing EcoDesign measures for PV modules.\nThese are the tools, which after more than 5 years of intense work, are so far are being applied in Europe to assess the ‘imbedded carbon intensity’ of PV modules.\n2. Our understanding upon reading the CBAM inception impact assessment\nIn reading your document, we understood that the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) will most likely be the tool used to assess sectors and products worthy of a carbon border adjustment. The Commission’s document also seems to allude to the fact that ETS benchmarks will be used to assess what goods and products entering the EU market from third countries might be subject to this adjustment because their production process used more CO2 than it would have in the EU.\nWe would be grateful for some clarifications on this point, in order to ensure that this approach is neither incompatible with the work and expertise we have committed to the EU Eco-Design process, nor compromises the current carbon leakage protection provided under the ETS.\n3 Outstanding questions\nEU ETS benchmarks are not always representative of manufacturing sites outside of the EU, how will objective comparisons be made to assess what product require carbon adjustment and which to do not. How can effective efforts of separate industries in third countries, to reduce the CO2 intensity of their production, be considered? Embedded carbon calculation are based on an assessment of the average CO2 intensity of national energy mixes. These vary widely among EU member states with a different energy mix. In addition, significant differences in the CO2 intensity of energy mixes can also be detected within national borders of key competitive regions, depending on where production is located. How will this be taken into account to assess whether third country production is more CO2 intensive than that of the EU? What about CO2 emissions in other stages of the life cycle than the manufacturing stage (extraction, use, recycling...?) How will this be taken into account to assess which products are least emitting on a life cycle basis? The EU ETS applies only to large EU installations. What happens when third country installations qualify as large (over 2OMW combustion), but EU installations do not as they are below the size which incorporates them into the ETS? Would a CBAM be WTO compliant in this case? How do we ensure the CBAM does not impact the competitiveness of Solar as an energy source compared to other energy sources? An impact on the price of CO2 allowances, due to\nSolarPower Europe\nRue d’Arlon 69-71 - 1040 Brussels - Belgium - +32 2 709 55 20 info@solarpowereurope.org : www.solarpowereurope.org\nSolarPower\nEurope\nthe CBAM, will influence-the EU’s wholesale electricity market, and this in turn, could have a significant indirect effects on the cost of renewable electricity. We must also ensure that, in practice, the CBAM does not slow down the deployment of Solar energy on the EU market, such as by increasing the cost of PV system components such as aluminium, glass or polysilicon. In particular for the energy-intensive steps of the solar value chain that are regulated under the EU ETS, legal coherence must be ensured without compromising the current level of carbon leakage protection provided by free allocation and indirect cost compensation.\nFinally, there are several concerns related to the overall compatibility of CBAM within multinational frameworks (e.g. WTO) and European regulations (e.g. ETS). In addition to legal, methodological and technical challenges, the harmful impact of political trade retaliation measures should not be left outside the scope when assessing the functionality of CBAM\n4. Conclusion\nSolarPower Europe aims to be a constructive partner for the Commission. We are available to EU authorities should they need further information on the established methodologies to assess the embedded carbon emissions of products and their life cycle impacts.\nSolarPower Europe\nRue d’Arlon 69-71 - 1040 Brussels - Belgium - +32 2 709 55 20 info@solarpowereurope.org : www.solarpowereurope.org"

Through our innovations, we contribute to the EU 2050 target of climate neutrality. While the required transformation of chemical value-chains will need political and regulatory support, we consider it highly important that relevant policy instruments are undergoing a diligent impact assessment. This impact assessment should not only include one instrument (CBAM) but compare this with improving existing instruments like the ETS as well as with developing new policy measures. Furthermore, it needs to consider not only the legal but political impact on recently strained trade relations.\n\nType of policy instrument\nThe impact assessment should seek a broad evaluation of policy tools, including optimizing and strengthening those available e.g. free allocation in the ETS and indirect costs compensation, but also explore new approaches and recent ideas e.g. carbon contracts for difference or other systems which allow for cost pass through.\nIn this context, an impact assessment should consider both scenarios: \n•\tProtection is given, leading to increased cost for end consumers, but also for the industrial transition (steel, concrete for windmills or new low-carbon production plants …).\n•\tLimited protection due to green (allocated) imports resulting in lower consumer prices but a loss of competitiveness of energy intensive EU production.\nCompliance with international treaties/law is a must. The assessment should encompass legal, political and economic feasibility aspects of the different policy measures, including their acceptance by 3rd countries. This is esp. important for a mostly net export sector like chemicals with its globally integrated complex value chains.\nAlso, exports need to be protected from carbon leakage. Effects of both, carbon costs and higher costs of carbon free production in the domestic as well as export markets, must be part of the impact analysis. EU-based productions must be able to compete on a level-playing field basis in all markets.\n\nMethodological approach\nNorms for disclosing the carbon content of a product have been developed, but they allow for substantial discretion in allocation, e.g. by weight or by value. They do not provide a clear number for each product beyond doubt and may be challenged by trading partners. Even with a globally harmonized political agreement on allocation rules, data containing confidential business information (CBI) needs to be shared for transparency/verification reason. Effectively protecting CBI must be part of considerations.\n\nSectoral scope\nThe Commission intends to evaluate sectors subject to a CBAM with a focus on sectors with the highest risk of carbon leakage. However, the complexity of chemical value chains means that a CBAM cannot sufficiently be assessed by only looking at basic products but must consider the impact on all its downstream subsectors. It is important to assess how a CBAM in an import oriented sector may lead to retaliation measures in an export oriented sector. This intersectoral connection must be adequately considered. A policy measure must ensure protection of all strategic EU sectors and value chains. \n\nPreliminary assessment of expected impacts\nA positive impact of policy options on R&D and innovation to develop of low-carbon products will only be realized, if certain additional conditions are met. Developing breakthrough innovation for the production of low-carbon products will require additional financial support, which must, besides technology innovation support, also cover new applications and scale ups. It is therefore important that the assessment of a CBAM also includes the effects on clean-innovation production in the EU. The criteria of this assessment should be both protection and transformation of European industry. This will require including alternative instruments in the assessment.",

        "feedback": "The design and implementation of a border carbon adjustment (BCA) or alternative policy should be guided by policy objectives in light of the potential trade-offs. We believe that strengthening of climate actions by reducing carbon leakage is the main goal since the European Green Deal aims to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. We also see other important objectives, including the avoidance of social and economic harms, the limitation of legal and political risks, the minimisation of the administrative complexity and costs of avoiding carbon leakage.\nVarious trade-offs and challenges exist for the design options of a BCA or its alternative.\nA BCA could target imports only, or both exports and imports. It could be added to existing or future free allocation or become a stand-alone anti-leakage measure for sectors at risk. Export rebates or (even more so) a combination of free allowances with export rebates could raise red flags, given that they do not serve climate protection and could qualify as prohibited subsidies under WTO rules. If there is no global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions for both domestic consumption and production. An export rebate would necessitate a decision to create a level playing field for all European exporters on the international market or support low-carbon European exports only. Import adjustments, on the contrary, could potentially be designed WTO compatible.\nIf a BCA is to be implemented, the issue of how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the EU needs to be addressed. This could be resolved by choosing default values for a sectorial average. Default values avoid trade discrimination but would not be fully accurate. A leakage risk remains. Full calculations can avoid leakage but are administratively very difficult. Default values would help in operating a BCA, if a BCA is applied to only a few sectors, given that data on production technologies across the EU exist. Third-party certification could be used by producers abroad that perform better than the EU average. A clear trade-off exists regarding the scope of a BCA. If it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. However, a broad scope results in high administrative burden and methodological clarity.\nThe different treatment of products with a carbon-intensity higher than the EU’s average could be at odds with the WTO law and the national treatment principle. It will depend on the details of the BCA design. The trade-off is between environmental effectiveness, which can be achieved by stringent and ambitious forms of discrimination under a BCA, and WTO legality, which is more easily achieved by less effective formulations.\nThe exemptions from a BCA for countries based on their climate policy actions would need agreement on criteria. Country-based exemptions are difficult to reconcile with the WTO principle of Most-Favoured Nation. Country-specific settings of the BCA would require scrutiny. Granting credits if there is carbon pricing in the country of export, however, is a key element of a BCA design. Such credits for non-price–based policies pose challenges in how to calculate them.\nAn alternative to border measures exists. By combining an emissions trading system with a consumption charge on carbon intensive materials, the ETS would continue to provide incentives for climate-friendly production of materials. The combination of free allocation of allowances with a consumption charge levied on carbon-intensive materials sold in the EU allows for a carbon price signal along the value chain and addresses leakage, while avoiding the complexities of trade-related measures.\n\nPlease find attached our contribution to the public consultation process, titled \"Designing Border Carbon Adjustments and Alternative Measures: An Overview\", which provides a brief analysis of policy design considerations for a BCA.",

This was an invitation to discuss elements of a border carbon adjustment (BCA) and policy alternatives to support more ambitious EU climate policies under the Paris Agreement. Different ambition levels across Parties to the Paris Agreement, in particular the different carbon costs incurred for producers, can trigger carbon leakage — the outsourcing of emissions. Leakage is driven by trade and the international division of labour, such that imports whose carbon content is not subject to a carbon price can undermine domestic carbon-pricing efforts, and exports can lose market share in international markets. Consideration of a BCA is not exclusive to the EU. Major past and current federal carbon pricing proposals in the United States, for example, include BCA mechanisms. Emerging economies have also considered BCA: Mexico, for one, mentions them as an option in its nationally determined contribution — the regularly updated national climate policy pledges under the Paris Agreement submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThe European Commission’s Green Deal will lead to more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030. Meeting the long-term goal of climate neutrality by 2050 will entail a profound decarbonisation across all sectors of the economy. The carbon price will have to increase significantly, likely well beyond what we have seen in the past, raising concerns about carbon leakage. The European Commission is thus reviewing all its policy approaches, including the Emissions Trading Directive, the Energy Tax Directive and the anti-leakage approaches taken so far, predominantly in the form of free allocation of emissions allowances. The Green Deal is supposed to unlock investments to achieve climate targets, broadening the policy approach beyond climate action to enable deeper decarbonisation. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic downturn will likely result in surplus production capacities and may potentially exacerbate carbon leakage concerns.\nIn the following sections, we discuss the design options for a BCA and alternative measures that may be implemented behind the border. As part of this discussion we analyse the general policy objectives of BCAs and alternative measures, present an overview of different basic types of policy design,\n1 We will refer to the general tool BCA in this brief, because the term is widespread in the literature and policy debates. as a\n1\nhighlight various implications of design choices and shortly address further issues, such as the use of potential revenues, and practical implementation of BCA.\nThis overview of BCA and policy design consideration is based on the expertise of the authors and relevant literature.

(2016) provides the framework of the subsequent discussion??*°.\nPolicy Objectives of a BCA and Alternative Measures\nAs the EU proceeds to elaborate a legislative proposal for the design and implementation of its BCA, it will be guided by several policy objectives. Clarity and transparency of policy objectives are critical for engaging with stakeholders within and outside the EU, for fostering broader understanding and acceptance of the measure and, importantly, for evaluating its performance and effectiveness following implementation. The tensions and trade-offs between competing objectives must be identified and balanced. Understanding the objectives of a BCA also allows policy makers to determine whether alternatives might be as effective but have lower economic or political cost or lower legal risk.\nStatements by decision makers and documents issued by the European Commission, including the Inception Impact Assessment roadmap, have variously mentioned the policy objectives of a future EU BCA or alternative measures. Whereas published documents have focused on strengthening climate action by avoiding carbon leakage®,statements by the EU and Member State officials — including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen— have also highlighted the need to avoid ‘unfair competition’ and ensure a level playing field for EU industry. Below we discuss these and additional aims that should guide the design and rollout of an EU BCA.\nStrengthening Climate Action\nFirst and foremost, the chosen policy should strengthen climate action. As will be elaborated below, focusing on this objective is vital for reducing the risk of legal challenges by trade partners. A BCA can potentially strengthen climate action in several ways, such as:\n- by limiting emissions leakage from the relocation of production and investment to non-EU countries with no or less restrictive carbon constraints, which may then supply the EU and global markets with higher carbon-content products; by ensuring full internalisation of carbon costs along the value chain to incentivise efficient material use and substitution with less carbon-intensive materials, and to create a business case for climate-neutral but likely higher-cost production processes; by creating incentives to reduce the carbon content of imported products by subjecting the emissions associated with their production to the EU carbon price; by enabling the EU to sustain greater climate ambition by alleviating domestic pressure from stakeholders concerned about the economic consequences of carbon leakage;\n2R.

That risks portraying the BCA as an economic rather than an environmental measure, potentially rendering it more vulnerable to challenges under international trade law (see also below). Nevertheless, these social and economic concerns are legitimate and play an outsized role in domestic policy debates. Where it occurs, emissions leakage also threatens economic opportunity. Affected companies worry about losing market share to foreign competitors,® while citizens worry about offshoring of jobs. Vulnerable industries are often concentrated in structurally disadvantaged regions, where industry relocation due to climate constraints can result in further loss of social cohesion.\nLimiting Legal and Political Risks\nAs the EU considers the design of a BCA, it needs to consider the policy’s legal basis, which in turn depends on the chosen mechanism. If it is designed as a fiscal measure, the BCA would most likely require a unanimous vote in the European Council, rendering its passage less likely. Implementation through an extension of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), on the other hand, would allow passage by a qualified majority vote. What is more, because a BCA will be imposed on imports and/or exports, it risks infringing on the EU’s commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and some regional trade agreements. In particular, restrictions on imports based on the carbon intensity of products may violate provisions on non-discrimination, and policy relief or exemptions for European producers could be seen as a prohibited subsidy under the WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Careful design and emphasis on the environmental objectives of the BCA can minimize these risks. Finally, the BCA is likely to incite heated political controversy by the EU’s trade partners. Past proposals to adjust for uneven climate policies have been followed by quick and ardent criticism from other countries, and the announcement of a BCA as part of the European Green Deal has likewise evinced censure from other countries. Such diplomatic fallout has the potential to undermine multilateral cooperation, including under the climate regime, and makes a case for both the design and rollout of a BCA to engage the trade partners in a fair, transparent, and inclusive process.\nMinimizing Administrative Complexity and Cost\nDepending on its design, the implementation of a BCA can incur considerable technical challenges and necessitate data that may not be available across the EU. Using default values for entire sectors rather than requiring calculation of emissions for each individual product, for instance, can reduce some complexities but also reduces the accuracy of the BCA as a tool to internalise the carbon cost of covered products. Likewise, a BCA that seeks to maximise its climate benefit would have the broadest possible scope, including basic materials as well as intermediate and final goods, yet their inclusion dramatically increases technical complexity, potentially raising the cost of implementation beyond the\n8 In this context, it is worth noting that BCA imports only will not, by itself, safeguard the competitiveness of EU products sold in a on foreign markets.\nclimate benefits. Navigating such trade-offs between objectives is an important consideration for the policy’s designers.\nBasic Types of BCAs and Alternative Measures\nPolicy measures to reduce or eliminate carbon price differences between domestic producers and their international competitors can take several forms. Each type of arrangement is characterised by a different combination of domestic production and consumption coverage, as well as the extent to which the adjustment covers import and exports.\nThe most straightforward option to reduce carbon price differences between domestic and international producers is to introduce instruments directly targeting trade flows — that is, border carbon adjustments, which can cover either imports only or both imports and exports. Import adjustments can take the form of a charge, or alternatively imports could be included in the EU ETS. Both policies have similar effects: domestic consumption of a given type of good is fully covered by carbon pricing and therefore also covers imports. The extent of BCA coverage (raw materials, intermediate goods, final goods) is a specific design choice discussed in the following section. An import BCA can be complemented by export adjustment, although this arrangement may be challenging from the WTO law perspective. It can take the form of direct costs refunds associated with the EU ETS (purchase of allowances) for the exported goods. In that case, full export adjustment will be achieved without any penalties or benefits associated with emissions intensity of the EU exports.\nAlternative mechanisms can limit carbon cost differentials for domestic and international producers without the introduction of border instruments. The current solution in the EU ETS is to provide free allocation of emissions allowances for domestic producers, with the number of allowances declining over time. It is at best a temporary measure and not a permanent solution to mitigate carbon price differentials between domestic and international producers. Instead, providing continuous free allocation that is linked to actual production volume ensures that the carbon price differential between domestic and international producers is limited over the longer term. If this so-called dynamic free allocation is based on product benchmarks, domestic producers are charged for emissions above the benchmark and rewarded for outperforming it. This means that: a) the carbon price signal is maintained for all domestic production; b) the cost burden for domestic producers associated with climate policy is reduced in both domestic and international markets; c) producers that outperform the benchmark receive a net benefit; and d) the carbon price signal for domestic consumption is largely muted. This last feature of dynamic free allocation is problematic from the perspective of overall cost-efficiency of climate mitigation, but it can be addressed by introducing an additional consumption charge based on product benchmarks for domestic consumers.\nThe final way to equalise the carbon prices faced by domestic and international producers is to completely switch from a production-based to a consumption-based carbon pricing scheme. This would involve excluding domestic producers from the EU ETS and instead introducing consumption charges based on the product’s carbon footprint. The approach is economically equivalent to introducing BCA for both exports and imports, but in practice tracing emissions from consumption is more technically and legally demanding than from production.\nTable 1 summarises the trade-offs associated with measures to address cross-border carbon price differentials.\nTable 1.

In the following, we briefly discuss the implication of design elements such as product coverage, default carbon intensity values, exemption and credits and continued free allocation.\nProduct Coverage\nThe coverage of a BCA must be evaluated across production chains and across material choices. Carbon-intensive basic materials serve as primary feedstock to the production chains of most manufacturing processes. In our globalized economy, production chains are heavily integrated with markets outside the EU, and manufacturers of intermediate products are often in direct competition with companies based abroad. Flaws in the BCA policy design might have disruptive effects on the domestic manufacturing sector while not achieving the goal of reducing the carbon footprint of imports. If only raw material imports are covered, end-product manufacturers may choose to procure intermediate products from non-EU manufacturers that are not affected by the BCA in their raw materials choice. A BCA that applies to a wide range of intermediate products with carbon-intensive material content, however, might impose a heavy administrative burden. Policy design should also address the dynamics of material substitutions. A static definition of raw materials covered by the legislation could favour the use of carbon-intensive alternatives that were not envisioned when the regulation was drafted. Although such material substitution may play a minor role for capital goods, the policy design needs to prevent unsustainable substitutional effects for intermediate and final goods.\nDefault Carbon Intensity Values\nObtaining actual carbon emissions data for every imported or exported product is infeasible.? A practical approach is to set a default emissions intensity value to calculate the level of adjustment at the border. These defaults may be uniform by product (such as the domestic sector’s average emissions intensity or an average of the top performers, or the best available technology) or differentiated according to the country or origin (such as for indirect emissions), production technology category, or a facility’s actual emissions. Table 2 summarizes the many trade-offs amongst accuracy, incentives, political, legal and administrative issues that are involved when choosing default values; notably, these trade-offs can be different for import adjustments than for export or production rebates.\nBasing the default value on a uniform measure can reduce legal and political risks, but such values may not accurately reflect the actual emissions intensity — especially when domestic intensity targets are ambitiously low. Uniform sector defaults for imports are thus less effective at transmitting carbon price signals. However, for export rebates, uniform defaults are less distorting than firm- or technology-specific rebates, which either exempt a portion of a firm’s actual emissions from carbon pricing or give larger de facto subsidies to dirtier producers. On the other hand, from a legal perspective, any rebates in excess of a firm’s actual carbon payments may be viewed as illegal subsidies, so uniform rebates cannot be too generous.\nFor imported goods, accurate transmission of carbon price signals requires appropriate differentiation, and foreign firms will have incentives to reduce their footprint only if such action translates into a smaller border adjustment. However, such differentiation increases complexity, requires extraterritorial information and risks legal challenges and trade conflicts. One solution is to combine uniform default values with an option for importers to reduce their border adjustments if they can demonstrate that their specific production process is more carbon efficient, such as by third- party certification in accordance with internationally recognised standards. As domestic emissions fall, a movement from default values based on domestic intensity towards defaults reflecting a global average emissions intensity will enhance effectiveness of the BCA and may aid in linking different systems internationally.\nIn the case of consumption charges, default carbon intensity values should be consistent with the benchmarks used for determining free allocation to domestic producers, which are in effect uniform standards.\n° To maximise leakage prevention and incentivise mitigation incentives, the of emissions used for emissions intensity values should scope include total emissions — that is, both direct and indirect emissions from electricity. However, including indirect emissions would increase feasibility, by reducing complexity and data requirements, as well as political and legal issues e.g. due to existing compensation mechanisms for indirect emissions in some member states.\nTable 2.

Cross indicates adverse effects.\nExemptions and Credits\nExemptions and credits are features unique to a BCA regime: neither would feature in a regime based on consumption charges.\nExemptions are country-based carve-outs from the application of a BCA. Such a feature presents two challenges. First, it would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)’s Article | (Most- Favoured Nation) and could be implemented only by invoking GATT’s Article XX (General Exceptions). Second, it is not clear what criteria would be appropriate for exemptions. Some have proposed that least-developed countries be exempted, and this may align with the UNFCCC principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). Other possibilities:\n- Exempt countries that are on track to meet their Paris Agreement commitments. However, those are voluntary commitments of widely varying ambition, and they are hard to verify. Exempt countries that have an emissions trading system with a hard cap, since no leakage can occur if the cap is adequate.\nAny such exemptions would be best specified in terms of objective criteria, and not left to executive discretion.\nCredits are adjustments to the amount owed for an imported product, based on an assessment that the product was subject to carbon pricing in the country of export. Absent such crediting, BCA and consumption-based charges both tilt the playing field to the detriment of the imported product, effectively double-charging for its carbon content. If the credit is for a carbon price—based policy in the country of export, the adjustment is more or less straightforward: a reduction in the amount payable, equal to the calculated carbon price already paid, whether that was in the form of a carbon tax or a mandated purchase of allowances. It is more challenging to grant credit for policies not based on price, such as automobile efficiency standards, because it is difficult (but not impossible) to calculate the price-equivalent effect of any policy and to keep abreast of changing standards. More fundamental is the challenge of deciding which policies to consider; many climate policies are not explicitly aimed at mitigation.\nContinued Free Allocation\nAllowances are allocated for free to industrial installations in the EU ETS. This limits carbon cost increases that could trigger relocation of production or investment to countries with lower carbon costs. In the EU, allocation is based largely on product benchmarks, thereby creating incentives for producers to improve production efficiencies.\nFour types of distortions from free allocation of allowances persist:\n- Incentives to innovate and invest in breakthrough low-carbon technologies and processes may be limited, since their deployment will lower the benchmark level (which is based on the best performers) and thus decrease the firm’s ability to recover incremental costs associated with climate-friendly new processes and receive carbon leakage protection for existing assets. Today’s production volumes will be the basis of the calculation of free allowance allocation in future years (production volume times benchmark level). This creates incentives to increase production and sales volumes and thus reduces carbon cost pass-through. With uncertainty about the level of carbon cost that can be passed through in product prices, a politically negotiated free allowance allocation could exceed the carbon costs left with producers, which would result in windfall profits. With limited carbon cost pass-through, the incentives for substitution with less carbon- intensive materials and efficient material use are limited. Furthermore, the business case for investments in (near) climate-neutral production processes is undermined if final consumers will not pay carbon costs and or the incremental costs of low-carbon alternatives.\nBCAs may offer, from an environmental and fiscal perspective, an opportunity to abandon free allocation of allowances, thus avoiding the first three distortions mentioned above and limiting the fourth. It has also been proposed to combine a BCA for an (unlimited) transition period with free allowance allocation. In that case, the level of the adjustment charge would need to be reduced by the level of free allocation to avoid discrimination. To the extent that a share of free allocation would be retained, all four environmental and fiscal concerns persist.\nIf, as an alternative, the EU ETS were complemented with a consumption charge at the benchmark level, then free allowance allocation would be reformed to be directly proportional to current (or the previous year’s) production volumes and the benchmark level for conventional processes. This would mute carbon cost pass-through from the EU ETS, other than for inefficiencies above the benchmark level. The full carbon cost pass-through would, however, be reinstated with the consumption charge.\nThus, all four distortions would be avoided, and the environmental and fiscal objectives would be achieved.\nOther issues\nThe practicality of a BCA or alternative measures depends on the other policy design aspects that must be considered thoroughly before their implementation. The use of potential revenues and the mechanism of implementation for a BCA are briefly discussed in this section.\nUse of Revenues\nBoth a BCA and consumption-based charges will generate revenues that may be used for various purposes. We envisage four major potential uses: a) substituting for other taxes (in the framework of a green fiscal reform); b) compensating households with direct financial transfers; c) financing low- carbon technologies or projects within the EU; and d) extending these financing options to developing countries. The allocation will need to be determined based on a political economy rationale, which may include efficiency, distributional fairness and equity (domestic or global) and overall emissions reduction aspects. This rationale may also vary depending on the policy option chosen.\nAn important issue here is that, depending on the policy option chosen, the revenues may be collected by the EU directly, or by the Member States, hence affecting how they are used. Also note that the chances that any BCA is ‘saved’ by the GATT’s General Exceptions are greatly increased if the revenues are directed to environmental purposes, and even more so if they are directed to international climate-related efforts that might benefit affected trade partners.\nMechanism of Implementation\nDifferent policy mechanisms can be drawn on to implement a BCA, and the Inception Impact Assessment roadmap highlights three options: a carbon tax on imported and domestic goods, a customs duty and the inclusion of imports in the EU ETS. Each mechanism faces different legal requirements for its adoption and implementation, including voting requirements under the EU law, implications for revenue use and likelihood of violating international trade disciplines.\nConceptually and administratively, implementation by way of a tax or duty may be the most straightforward yet difficult to adopt politically: measures that are primarily fiscal — such as a tax — require unanimity in the European Council and are thus easier for individual Member States to block, whereas customs duties may require the renegotiation of existing tariff arrangements under the WTO or regional and bilateral trade agreements. Implementation by way of an extension of the EU ETS would require only a qualified majority vote in the European Council but raises complex administrative challenges, from aligning with the EU ETS cap or creating a separate pool of virtual allowances to correlating the adjustment level to the variable market price of the EU ETS allowances.\nGenerally, the mechanism of implementation should adhere as closely to the mechanism faced by domestic producers, to reduce the risk of challenges based on GATT’s national treatment provisions. Because the EU producers are subject to the EU ETS as the main decarbonisation policy, BCA implementation should require importers or foreign producers to either purchase allowances to cover their emissions or pay a levy based on the market price of allowances. Alternatively, importers or foreign producers could be allowed to purchase international carbon offsets or emissions allowances from other established markets with clear emission caps up to the determined value of the adjustment. To avoid problems of unpredictable swings in prices, importers should be afforded the same compliance timeframe as domestic firms.\nConclusion\nThe design and implementation of a border carbon adjustment or alternative policy should be guided by policy objectives in light of the potential trade-offs. We believe, strengthening of climate action by reducing carbon leakage is the overarching goal, given that the European Green Deal aims to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. We also see other important objectives, including the avoidance of adverse social and economic implications of such action, the limitation of legal and political risks, and minimisation of the administrative complexity and costs of addressing carbon leakage.\nIn sum, the following trade-offs and challenges exist for the design options of a BCA or its alternatives.\nTo tackle leakage, a BCA could target imports only, or both exports and imports. It could be added to the existing or future free allocation of emissions allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage, or it could become a stand-alone anti-leakage measure for sectors at risk. Export rebates or (even more so) a combination of free allowances with export rebates could raise red flags, given that they do not serve climate protection and could qualify as prohibited subsidies under WTO rules. As long as there is no single global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions caused both by domestic consumption and production. An export rebate would necessitate a decision to either create a level playing field for all EU exporters on the international market or support low-carbon EU exports only. Import adjustments, on the contrary, could be designed in a way that is potentially WTO compatible.\nIf a BCA is chosen, how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the EU becomes an issue. This could be resolved in part by choosing default values for a sectoral average. The default values, while avoiding trade discrimination, would not be fully accurate, thus leaving room for leakage. Full calculations can avoid leakage to a large extent but are administratively very difficult to implement and may face legal risks under WTO law. Default values would help in operating a BCA, in cases where the BCA applied only to a few sectors (instead of all traded goods), provided the data on production technologies across the EU exist. Third-party certification could be a solution for producers abroad to get credit if they perform better than the EU average. A clear trade-off exists regarding the scope of producers covered. If it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. However, a broad scope comes with high burdens for administration and also methodological clarity.\nThe different treatment of products with a carbon-intensity value higher than the EU’s average could be at odds with the EU’s WTO obligations, in particular the national treatment principle. But the details of the scheme clearly matter. The trade-off here is between environmental effectiveness, which can be achieved by stringent and ambitious forms of discrimination under a BCA, and WTO legality, which is more easily achieved by less environmentally effective formulations.\nThe exemptions from a BCA for countries based on their climate policy actions would need a clear agreement on criteria. Country-based exemptions are difficult to reconcile with the WTO principle of Most-Favoured Nation. The country-specific settings of the BCA thus would require scrutiny. Allowing for a credit if there is carbon pricing in the country of export, however, is a key element of a BCA design. Granting credits for non-price—based policies poses difficult challenges as to how to calculate them.\nAn alternative to taking measures at the border exists. By combining an emissions trading system with a consumption charge on carbon intensive materials, the EU ETS would continue to provide incentives for climate-friendly production of materials. The combination of free allocation of emissions\n10\nallowances with a consumption charge levied on carbon-intensive materials sold in the EU (for both imported and domestic materials) allows for a carbon price signal along the value chain and addresses leakage. It also avoids the complexities of trade-related measures.\nThe European Commission will need to review options for a BCA and alternatives keeping in view other climate policy instruments, as it seeks to develop a consistent and robust policy framework that can guide the Member States to climate neutrality.\n11"

It represents the second most exported product, just behind oil. It is a national scale economy that involves other sectors: paperboard, plastics, logistics, etc. It is considered an “ice breaker” economy: banana industry reaches new ports around the world for other Ecuadorian products to find a market there. It creates 250.000 direct jobs, and more than 30.000 indirect ones.\nConsidering the importance of banana industry for Ecuador’s economy, the amount of jobs that it creates, the environmental, economic and societal projects that it involves’, the Ecuadorian Banana Cluster plays an important role within the framework of the current EU-Ecuador FTA, being fully committed as a reliable partner to achieve the objectives stated on the Title on Trade and Sustainable Development.\nTherefore, it is of crucial importance that the EU takes into consideration in its Impact Assessment the consequences that a Carbon Border Adjustment Measures (CBA) may have in Ecuador’s social and economical development.\nIl. How CBA should be designed\nAs initially suggested by the European Commission’, one of the main objectives of the EU with the CBA is to ensure European companies do not have competitive disadvantages compared to companies from countries with lax climate regulations, and to prevent companies from simply moving carbon-intensive production to third countries to avoid the EU's environmental standards (also known as carbon leakage).\nThe objective of the CBA is to allow the EU to pursue ambitious climate objectives to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the Earth’s atmosphere, whilst ensuring that domestic efforts do not simply serve to drive production and GHGs emissions elsewhere.\nHowever, absent a revenue redistribution policy, the adjustment cost will ultimately be borne by the final consumer (in the EU) according to their consumption habits. Therefore, measures must be put in place to ensure that the tax is socially just and does not disproportionately impact low-income households.\nAdditionally, the risk of carbon leakage is still being debated in research’, i.e. the risk that without the CBA, EU climate regulations might create perverse incentives for more imports from countries outside the EU which might be harming the environment, climate and rights.\n1 “Assessing the economic impactof the Trade Agreementbetween the European Union and Ecuador”, European Commission, available at: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/september/tradoc 154964.pdf\n2 According to ACORBANEC statistics: http://www.acorbanec.com/\n3 https://www.followmetothefield.com/es/\n4 “Mission Letter of Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy”, 1 December 2019, available at:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/sites/comm-cwt2019/files/commissioner_ mission letters/mission-letter-paolo-\n\ngentiloni_en.pdf\n5 “A European carbon border tax: much pain, little gain”, Bruegel, 2020, available at: https://www.bruegel.org/2020/03/a-european- carbon-border-tax-much-pain-little-gain/\n& \"A Proposition for Multilateral Carbon Tax Treaty”, T. Falcao, 2019, IBFD Online Books. a\n7 Like-product is the WTO terminology to designate similar product. a\nIn this paper we do not undertake to assess climate impacts of this tool. Instead, this paper should be seen as a complementary analysis of socio-economic impacts to accompany analysis from a climate perspective.\nWe consider that, if eventually the EU will design the CBA, it should be guided by the following principles:\n1. Global environmental benefit: a CBA should be designed with global climate, environment and social objectives at its core, and should be flexible and nuanced enough to avoid causing perverse incentives in other countries that ultimately lead to more harm.\n2. Policy Coherence for Development: a CBA should be coherent with development policy objectives and avoid any negative impact on the economies of developing countries, including via flanking measures.\n3. Equity: acknowledging the EU’s climate debt towards developing countries, as early industrialized countries have already consumed most of the global carbon budget and must undertake steeper emission reductions to keep the planet under 1.5°C of average global warming.\n4. Existing EU-Ecuador bilateral commitments: special approach towards the multilateral FTA, in order to encourage the existing obligations assumed between parties and consider impact on tariff-free access to the EU market.\n6. Fairness and progressivity: considerations of progressivity must be applied to both the exporting developing countries as well as importing EU countries, to ensure the CBA does not create an additional, disproportionate burden on low-income households in Europe nor negative impacts on jobs and inequality in Ecuador.\nIl. Carbon adjustments and WTO\nThe WTO is responsible for regulating when a border adjustment is admissible and when it is not through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For carbon border adjustments to be admissible, the tax applied (or credited) must be applied on both foreign and domestically produced products. The tax cannot unduly burden a foreign derived product. Moreover, the tax can only be applied on a product, not a process (also referred to as ‘taxes occultes’ or hidden taxes under WTO rules)®. Taxes occultes are not admissible under WTO regulations.\nIt follows from the above that, under WTO regulations, the following requirements are necessary for a carbon border adjustment to be admissible:\n1 An equivalent tax ought to be applied on a like-domestic product’. The concept of equivalence requires the tax rate of the national product and the imported product to be similar, so that no undue burden is applied on the foreign derived product in sucha way that it might constitute a hindrance to trade. The tax must be levied on a product and not a process. Carbon taxes would therefore be admissible if employed both domestically and at the border, but the same might not hold\ntrue for energy taxes (if they apply in the production process, not to the finished product) — although a conclusion cannot be reached until the details of the policy are revealed.\nA key challenge for the carbon border adjustment intended by the EU is whether it will be a mechanism able to differentiate between the environmental impact of products produced in different ways, or whether it will only be able to recognize whether the import is burdened by a domestic carbon tax in the exporting country.\nIV. Carbon footprint of the banana supply chain®\nThe calculation of a carbon footprint of a product is the sum of all materials, energy and waste across all lifecycle activities thereof, multiplied by emission factors and global warming potentials (GWPs). The carbon footprint of the banana industry is spread across the entire value chain, which can be divided into three broad steps: production and packing, transport and shipping, and ripening (for exported bananas). However, it is relevant to point out that only 15%-20% of world banana production is traded globally (the biggest banana producing countries such as India or Brazil export very little and keep most for domestic consumption).\nISO 14064 standard on quantification of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases represents a fundamental instrument for the estimation of carbon footprint in banana companies. ISO standards 14040 and 14044 on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and PAS 2050 Carbon Footprint Verification (published by the British Standards Institution) provide a recognized framework for carbon footprint and lifecycle analysis.\nHowever, the results can vary considerably depending on the chosen methodology, scope and boundaries, and because every study needs to be adjusted to local conditions and emission factors. For example, some carbon footprint studies take into account the steps of land use change and consumer transport and wastage in the calculation scope. Within the evolving field of carbon footprint, calculation methodologies are multiple and still under construction to fit with growing expectations.\nDespite bananas being an important product, only few carbon footprints analyses have been published, and the results have varied depending on the methodology and data: from 324g to 1.124kg CO2e/kg of bananas.\nAlthough they defined different boundaries, banana carbon footprint studies have identified maritime transport (including refrigerants) as the main contributor to the banana supply chain carbon footprint, followed by the manufacture and use of fertilizers and the manufacture and preparation of carton boxes in packing stations.\nThese aspects should be taken into consideration when designing CBA for banana import from Ecuador.\nV Potential impact on developing countries\nA carbon border adjustment would be a tax levied at the border at a price that is commensurate with the carbon tax (or price) being applied domestically. An EU-wide carbon border adjustment would either (i) be commensurate with the cost borne by companies under the ETS; (ii) correspond to the carbon tax applied by each EU Member State (if the policy allows for different States to employ different tax rates); or (iii) be commensurate with a potential EU-wide carbon\n8 “Carbon Footprint of the Banana Supply Chain”, 16842EN/1/02.17, FAO, World Banana Forum, available at: http://www. fao.org/3/a-i6842e.pdf\nVi Conclusion\ntax, introduced into the common area. The objective of such a policy is to provide cost parity between the domestically produced and the imported product, so that they are both negotiated at equivalent prices within the EU common market, and so that domestically produced products are not disproportionately affected by the domestic tax.\nThe EU might consider granting a carbon border adjustment exemption to countries administering equivalent carbon taxes. Should the EU tax rate be higher than in partner countries, a partial exemption from the tax could be administered in the EU, corresponding to the rate employed in the third country of origin. Under a partial exemption system, the carbon border adjustment rate would correspond to the EU tax rate minus the rate already employed by the third state. The overall result would be to assess the carbon border adjustment at the full EU rate, while avoiding double taxation.\nWith or without these exemptions, an EU carbon border tax may have an impact on developing countries in many ways:\n1 As products imported from developing countries might become less competitive than they are at the moment for the EU market if a carbon border adjustment is introduced, this could result in lower exports to the EU, with potential negative impacts on jobs in those countries if flanking measures as part of a just transition are not in place. Secondly, the carbon border adjustment would apply to goods from all countries, even the least developed countries. This does not take into account the Paris Agreement recognition that developing countries have differentiated responsibilities, as they have historically contributed far less to global emissions than early industrialized countries. While the EU should support an alternative development pathway, the EU should also respect the policy space of the countries in question, as well as international commitments in the area of climate action, finance and development. The EU could consider exempting least developed countries from a CBA or returning all proceeds from the CBA applying on imports from developing countries to those countries for their own budgetary needs. An additional concern is that the CBA, if it can only be adjusted down if exporting countries already implement a carbon tax or price, could in fact act as a penalty on developing countries for not having their own carbon tax. This ignores the fact that there are various legitimate reasons why some developing countries may have decided not to implement a national carbon tax, including fairness and equality concerns at domestic level - and that they might have more suitable policy options for supporting a just transition (for example, better royalties regimes on extractives). Carbon taxes, when poorly designed, can be regressive and have disproportionate impacts on people living in developing countries.\nBased on our analysis of potential impacts on developing countries, we conclude that, if the EU does decide to go ahead with a CBA, it must thoroughly consider in the Impact Assessment the following challenges:\n1 Is the CBA an effective tool to discourage carbon leakage or high GHGs in countries exporting to the EU? Are there other measures that could be more effective, e.g. import standards regulations?\nVil. Our requests\nIs the CBA able to recognize and adjust when other national policies, practices or regulations beyond domestic carbon prices and taxes have led to reduced GHG emissions and benefits to the environment? Finding the right balance between respecting developing countries’ policy space, export needs and the EU’s policy coherence for development principle. How to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalized by higher prices on essential products? Social considerations will need to be taken into account to ensure that the cost of the carbon tax does not disproportionately fall on lower-income households, especially for products for which there are no sustainable alternatives currently available and accessible to them. Can the revenues from the CBA be used in a fair way? The revenues accumulated in Europe via the CBA when imposed on products imported from developing countries could be transferred back to the countries concerned for their own budgetary goals, in order to strengthen their domestic resource mobilization for financing of public services such as housing, education, health, environmental protection, or a just transition.\nTo consider in the Impact Assessment:\n1. The social and economic consequences that a CBA may have on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) commitments assumed in the EU-Ecuador FTA. The feedback on this issue from the sixth Sub-committee on TSD of the EU-Ecuador FTA. The potential negative impacts on jobs in Ecuador. The complexity of defining a clear single methodology to assess the carbon footprint of the banana supply chain. The potential negative impact on low-income households in Europe when purchasing such an essential and affordable product as banana is.

Setting a fixed end date for the CBAM reduces the policy uncertainty that is currently delaying necessary investment into new production technologies in the cement, steel or aluminium industries. The \"stick\", or \"pull-factor\", of a phase-out on the horizon would complement the \"carrot\", or innovation push, provided by research funding, and unlock the creative capacities of European companies to enable them to become innovation leaders, as the European Green Deal envisions it. \n\nThe CBAM could then be framed as a measure to accompany European industries in their transition rather than to protect them. The duration should consequently be based on expert assessment of the time necessary to transition to low-carbon production in key energy-intensive industries. \n\nIn terms of political economy, a transparent end date or phase-out conditions would signal to industry that any delays in investment and any lobbying efforts to ease internal regulation would only harm their long-term viability in a post-CBAM world, and thereby avoid moral hazard. \n\nAs a co-benefit, a time-limited CBAM would signal to the international community that EU intends to move to global carbon pricing without border adjustments in the long term. Several academic proposals in recent years (Cosbey et al., 2012; Mehling et al. 2019) foresee a sunset clause for this latter reason. ",

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association"

While the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) Mechanism could be an important tool ensuring that imports “reflect more accurately their carbon content”, it must be accompanied by an equally effective carbon price within the EU. With the CBA set to tackle carbon leakage, it must be acknowledged that current levels of carbon leakage are minimal, and any potential future threat hinges on increased asymmetries in global climate ambition levels and carbon prices. Although a CBA could be an important tool in such a context, incentivising global climate ambition levels, it cannot be seen as a silver bullet.\n \nIn the context of the EU ETS, a CBA is preferable to the current system of free allowances. It is important to note that free allowances cannot operate together or in conjunction with a CBA on the same products. It would either result in not being WTO compliant through double protection of domestic industry, or reduce its effect as any benefit derived from free allowances would also be extended to imports.\n \nAs the current threat of carbon leakage is minimal, free allowances under EU ETS are resulting in windfall profits rather than protecting against actual carbon leakage. As a result, the current system may in fact contribute to steering investments away from the EU, in particular from decarbonisation efforts. In the upcoming revision of the EU ETS, Bellona Europa strongly recommends that the European Commission complete a full phase-out of free allowances, introduce a price floor and ensure a strengthened and dynamic Market Stability Reserve (MSR) to account for market developments. Although a proposed CBA on imports can be an enabling tool for global climate ambition, it is not sufficient on its own.\n\nA CBA mechanism must therefore be accompanied by a comprehensive policy package incentivising low carbon investments, production and consumption within the EU. This must include a portfolio of measures including market drivers for uptake of clean products. Bellona Europa urges the European Commission to include a thorough assessment of all available policy options and tools in the upcoming impact assessment, including the introduction of product standards. Above all, any CBA or policy influencing the treatment of imports must be for climate and not protectionism.\n \nThe aims below must be at the heart of any potential CBA for it to deliver. If not, a CBA on imports risks being nothing more than a vaguely disguised protectionist measure where global climate ambition and emission cuts are secondary targets.\n \n1.       Encourage and incentivize third countries to increase climate ambition to access the European market. In turn reducing total global emissions and facilitate the development of low-carbon products and markets.\n \n2.       Facilitate development of low-carbon products and markets in Europe, through sustained demand and predictability, for industries facing “like” cheaper carbon-intensive imports. In turn facilitating further sustainable investment and growth as outlined in the European Green Deal, and also in line with the “just transition for all”.\n\nLastly, a CBA must take “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” into account, and resulting revenue should be earmarked to reach set the aforementioned aims, with a particular focus on Least-Developed Countries (LDC).\n",

Considering the necessity of a CBAM creation does not imply that CAN Europe agrees with the notion that our industry suffers from carbon leakage, as this is still largely unproven. If a CBAM is to be implemented  this would need to be complemented by an immediate and total cancellation of all free allowances currently distributed to high emitting industries in the ETS. Indeed, free allocations have resulted in windfall profits for industries and a distorted carbon price signal without addressing the fact that some imports of unrestricted products can undermine the overall EU climate protection effort.\n\nb. CAN Europe support the concept of the externalities of products so that products reflect their ‘true costs’, including for goods imported into the EU. The EU’s inclusion of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in its European Green Deal and new Industrial Strategy shows the intentions of the European Commission to consider the design and implications of such a mechanism. As such, this could be a first step in ensuring that products (including those from outside the EU) reflect their truer costs by integrating at least a carbon price into a given product.\n\nc. However, there is still a lack of data availability in the current international system to determine the carbon content of some products, including those of heavy industry, making it difficult to determine a payment value based on the carbon content of a given product. For an effective measure it would need to be designed and implemented in a way that balances environmental, trade law and fairness concerns. \n\nd. CBAM is one among many various measures that can be used to promote decarbonisation of industrial goods. Designing an efficient CBAM will be challenging and, being a measure amongst others, must not take up all policy development capacity.\n\ne. A CBAM has both the potential, on the positive side, to pressure other countries to invest in putting in place industrial decarbonisation policies, as well as, on the negative side, to reduce other countries willingness to engage in multilateral cooperation as a CBAM might be seen as a unilateral initiative. The European Commission should investigate the potential impact of a CBAM on the international climate regime, as well as on the capacity of poorer countries to implement both the Sustainable Development Goals and the net-zero transition needed to implement the Paris Agreement.\n",

Its mission is to improve environmental, energy, and natural resource decisions through impartial economic research and policy engagement. RFF is committed to being the most widely trusted source of research insights and policy solutions leading to a healthy environment and a thriving economy.\n\nWhile RFF researchers are encouraged to offer their expertise to inform policy decisions, the views expressed here are those of the individual authors and may differ from those of other RFF experts, its officers, or its directors. RFF does not take positions on specific policy proposals.\n\nOur comments derive from research with collaborators from Georgetown University to develop a published framework (attached) for WTO-compliant border tax adjustments (BTAs) in the context of a US upstream GHG tax. The effort involves extensive discussions with former US government officials, trade lawyers, associations and academics. \n\nEmission Measurements: Voluntary, international guidelines have been widely used for decades by firms in energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries to measure GHG emissions from facilities. Results are compatible with regulatory procedures that exist in many nations. More recently, voluntary guidelines have been developed to evaluate the GHG footprint of products. The challenge is to allocate emissions from facilities to the products they create. Our framework describes a Greenhouse Gas Index (GGI) as an administrative tool to evaluate BTAs based on a GHG tax. Products with GGI of at least 0.5 tonnes CO2e per tonne of product would be eligible for export rebates and subject to import charges. The threshold covers commodity products of major EITE industries. These approaches form a foundation to develop regulatory procedures for BTAs. The effort would benefit from public-private partnerships with industry and other stakeholders.\n\nExport rebates: European manufacturers compete in both domestic and export markets with firms from nations with less stringent GHG controls. Both markets should be addressed to alleviate competitive damages and GHG leakage. CBAM should consider establishing rebates for domestic exports as well as charges on imports.\n\nChallenges to WTO Compatibility:\n\n•\tDifficult and likely insurmountable barriers to WTO-compatible BTAs exist, if import charges are not based on a domestic tax on like products. BTAs that offset regulatory procedures such as the EU-ETS do not appear to be compatible with current WTO rules and practice. Even if they were compliant, such proposals face difficult methodological challenges to evaluate an “equivalent cost” to assign to imports. The ETS applies to facilities, not products, and its price setting process results in a variable not a fixed price. While methods described above might assist in translating the price from facilities to products, they do not provide a solution to the variable price.\n\n•\tThe Most Favored Nation principle of WTO requires that import BTAs be assigned on the same basis for all nations. Import charges cannot be adjusted to provide credit for the various domestic policies of exporting nations. This is fortunate since objective methods do not exist to determine the equivalent price to assign to imports from the wide variety of nations that export to the EU with vastly different policy portfolios and stringency. \n\nKey points from our observations are: 1) methodologies exist that could provide a basis to assign GHG emissions from facilities to the GHG-intensive products that they produce, 2) without a domestic tax on GHG-intensive products it will be unlikely to create WTO compatible approaches to BTAs.\n\nDr. Brian P.

Introduction\nDiscussions regarding policies to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been ongoing for decades, and GHG policies of various types have been implemented for years in many countries. In practice, countries that adopt GHG policies utilize a portfolio that typically includes a mix of standards, subsidies, mandates and price-based policies, each directed at particular economic sectors. In view of obvious inefficiencies and lack of synergies resulting from the portfolio approach, economists and many others have convincingly argued that setting a price on carbon—and other GHG emissions—using an economy-wide, upstream GHG tax would be the most effective and efficient policy to address GHG emissions. Its effectiveness stems from being able to cover all emissions from production and use of fossil fuels by applying the tax on producers of coal, oil, and gas resources at the mine mouth and wellhead before they are combusted, rather than dealing with actual emissions from millions of individual sources and actors throughout the economy. Its efficiency stems from allowing markets, rather than the political process, to identify and implement the most cost-effective steps to reduce emissions through decisions that affect current operations and purchases, and through decisions now about investment, research and development to invent and deploy more effective solutions to reduce future GHG emissions.\nMyriad issues must be addressed to design and approve legislation to implement an upstream, economy-wide GHG tax. This report does not address that galaxy of challenges and opportunities. Rather, assuming that an upstream GHG tax could be\n1 Compendium: WTO-Compatible Methodologies to Determine Export Rebates and Import Charges for Products of Energy-Intensive, Trade-Exposed Industries, if there is an Upstream Tax on Greenhouse Gases, Jan W. Mares and Brian P. Flannery (forthcoming).\nwww.rff.org | 1\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\nimplemented, the report addresses the challenge of border adjustments for exports and imports in the context of a domestic upstream GHG tax, as described below.\nThe domestic GHG tax could cause energy-intensive industries to shift production to countries without comparable pricing, resulting in “leakage” of GHG emissions that the domestic tax aims to prevent. By shifting production from the United States, the tax would also disadvantage domestic manufacturers, their employees, and the communities where they operate. Hence, the call by many to introduce border adjustments: through the imposition of equivalent GHG pricing on imported products from energy- intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries, and by providing rebates from the impact of the upstream tax on the cost of products exported by domestic producers. However, doing this has raised concerns about consistency with rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nHere we propose a Framework for a US climate policy with border adjustments that are compatible with US obligations under WTO agreements. It is based on an upstream tax on GHG emissions with rebates for exports and charges on imports for products from EITE industries. A companion Compendium! (forthcoming) provides additional details on implementing border adjustments with specific recommendations for 35 EITE industries. Proposed border measures are designed in a non-discriminatory fashion, with the intent and effect of reducing global GHG emissions. Therefore, the border adjustments proposed as part of the Framework will not give rise to any valid claims of WTO violations. Even if such\nclaims should be raised, a strong defense could be made under the exceptions to the WTO rules.\nIssues in the design of border adjustments for internationally traded products also bring into focus the distinctly different roles and practices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the WTO. While climate policies have the potential to create trade disputes, if they occur, they will be resolved through the WTO, which has the authority, experience and tools to resolve them, not through the UNFCCC, which does not. To avoid lengthy, potentially divisive battles between trading partners striving to fulfill commitments to two independent international institutions, it would be desirable to formulate domestic climate policies that are compatible with both WTO and UNFCCC obligations. However, as addressed in countless scholarly papers, this, particularly compliance with WTO obligations, can be complicated.’ In particular, proposals that argue for trade remedies based on environmental exceptions under the WTO, (e.g., to prevent GHG leakage), would not be allowed if they resulted in arbitrary discrimination or disguised restrictions on trade.\nIn what follows: Section 2 sets the scene with background and additional details on the current state of the international climate regime under the Paris Agreement; Section 3 provides an overview of the proposed Framework and issues to address for WTO compatibility; Section 4 describes some common cross-cutting elements that affect many sectors, e.g., how to treat electricity, cogeneration and recycling; Section 5 illustrates how the Framework applies to EITE sectors including some that present unique\n2 See Addressing Competitiveness Concerns in a Carbon Tax: What Are the Options? (October 27, 2015) and references mentioned.\nhttp://www.rff.org/events/event/2015-10/addressing-\ncompetitiveness-concerns-carbon-tax-what-are-options\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nfeatures; Section 6 presents a summary and conclusions. A companion Compendium to this report is forthcoming and will provide an overview with detailed discussion of the application of the Framework to oil and gas production, coal production, oil refining and electricity, and modules of varying length for 31 other EITE sectors.\nThis discussion does not address the merits or political challenges of gaining support for an upstream tax on US GHG emissions or how revenues would be used. We note that revenues would be significant even at levels under discussion to initiate such a tax and they would grow significantly over time if the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement were to be met. Though smaller, sums involved in rebates for exports and those imposed on imports would also be significant. Rebates would likely reduce income from domestic revenues by at least $20 billion per year. These estimates are dominated by fossil fuel resources and products. They would vary considerably from sector to sector. The Framework makes no proposal for how the import charge should be collected or used. It seems reasonable to assume that it should be collected with other charges on imported products, entered into US general revenue and, if directed, used for the same purposes as revenue from the domestic GHG tax.\n2. Scene Set\nThe seeds of this challenge were planted in the 1980s as nations began to consider how to frame international cooperation to address climate change. While developed nations realized that domestic climate policy could decrease economic growth and affect their international competitiveness, developing nations voiced far greater concern that\nwww.rf.org | 2\ndomestic and international climate policies could hinder their overriding priorities for economic development and poverty alleviation, and adversely affect trading relations. Consequently, developing nations insisted that the UNFCCC incorporate Principles (see Article 3) to limit adverse outcomes. Articles 3.1 (common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities: CBDR-RC) and 3.5 highlight the challenge for trade and climate.\n3.1 The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof. 3.5 Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.\nCBDR-RC played a significant role in both the UNFCCC (1992) and, later, the Kyoto Protocol (1997), both require only developed nations to take commitments to limit GHG emissions. Despite enormous changes in geopolitical and economic circumstances since 1990, efforts by developed nations to evolve to a less stringent approach to CBDR-RC have been only partially successful, and challenges to trade remain.\nToday, trade and climate concerns not only persist, they proliferate. Under the Paris Agreement (2015) pledges for national action prolong (at least through 2030) and reinforce differences among nations both in stringency and types of policies they use to limit GHG emissions. In this respect, challenges exist not only between developed and developing nations, but also from growing differences\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\namong developed nations (as highlighted by withdrawals from the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period, and recently by the announced intention of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, possibly contingent on further developments). Important differences also exist that create challenges among developing nations. If, in pursuing the very ambitious long-term goals of the Agreement, some nations increase ambition over time more than others, then trade tensions may escalate as effects for specific sectors and nations become clearer and more pronounced.\nIn the United States and most developed nations, GHG emissions occur primarily as carbon dioxide (COz) from combustion of fossil fuels. In the United States, energy- related CO2 emissions account for over 80 percent of total GHG emissions. While overall economic impacts of climate policy today may be small for nations like the United States with large, diversified economies, they can be much greater in specific sectors and regions, and in nations where exports of fossil fuels and energy-intensive products play a major role (e.g., OPEC nations, Russia, Canada). This is especially so for EITE industries, that include oil & gas, chemicals, steel, aluminum, cement, plastics, and paper.\n3. Overview of the Framework\nThere are several elements to the Framework. They include: Section 3.1 methodologies to determine GHG emissions from facilities and operations of EITE industries and, as described here and in the Compendium, to allocate them to specific products; Section 3.2 issues to be addressed to be compatible with WTO; Section 3.3 descriptions of the upstream GHG tax and associated rebates for products that are exported and charges on imported products; Section 3.4 WTO rules and border tax adjustments (BTA), a deeper dive; Section 3.5 specification of EITE industries and information to be reported; and Section 3.6 border adjustments determined in a manner analogous to the familiar value-added tax\nwww.rf.org | 3\n(VAT), but here applied to cumulative GHG emissions. (To avoid any confusion: note that the upstream GHG tax itself is not a VAT. The value-added concept uses cumulative GHG emissions as an administrative index to track costs generated by the upstream GHG tax as they flow through the economy to affect downstream suppliers, producers and customers.)\nAs described in Section 3.2, in the United States and other nations that adopt it, this proposal would fundamentally shift the focus of efforts to mitigate emissions connected to international trade from a system based on where goods are produced to one where they are consumed.\nThe Framework covers not only CO2 but also emissions of other significant GHGs covered by US regulations. These include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20), HFCs, PFCs and SF6, which can be especially important for some sectors. Regulations provide factors? that denote the contribution of each gas relative to CO2 by weight. This allows the GHG tax (in US$ per tonne CO2) to be applied to the full set of emissions expressed as tonnes CO?-equivalent (CO2e).*\nThroughout the discussion it is important to recognize distinctions between existing GHG policies and methods that address and apply to emissions from facilities and operations of manufacturers—in the context of GHG taxes, cap-and-trade systems, and emissions reporting—rather than the perspective required in this Framework for border adjustments that apply to specific products of firms in EITE sectors. This requires two extensions beyond current\n3 The UNFCCC and most nations set these weighting factors based on the 100-year Global Warming Potential as published and updated from time to time by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, regulatory updates may lag those by IPCC.\n4\nTo be consistent with the large number of international papers in this field, we have chosen to denominate weight in metric tonnes (1 tonne equals 1.102 short tons).\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\npractice: first, to specify how GHG emissions from upstream suppliers and on-site operations contribute to determine cumulative GHG emissions required to produce products; and second, to determine how GHG emissions from entire facilities (and operations) can be apportioned to the products they produce.\nThe Framework addresses these issues by defining an index for the cumulative GHG emissions of specific products manufactured in a specific facility in an EITE industry—a greenhouse gas index (GGI).° GGI for products from specific manufacturers includes contributions from: 1) inputs (GGI) from products purchased by the manufacturer from suppliers in EITE sectors, 2) process GHG emissions (if any) from on-site operations of the manufacturer, and (3) upstream producers of oil, gas and coal products include a third contribution to GGI from the carbon content of produced fossil resources. The carbon content of produced fossil resources is determined at the wellhead for oil and gas and at the mine mouth for coal—the contribution from contained carbon is converted into CO2 emissions under the assumption that 100 percent of the carbon will be emitted as CO2 upon combustion by downstream users. These contributions embody an approach analogous to that used in VAT: here based on following GHG emissions that occur along the supply chain to produce and, in the case of the carbon content of fossil fuels, the tax is prepaid for administrative convenience before later combustion of fuel products. Following cumulative emissions provides an effective administrative tool to track the economic impact of the upstream tax on downstream\n5 In light of further exploration of this topic in the accompanying Compendium (published in October 2018), we have decided to use this term and related shorthand, GGI—a switch from the acronym used (PCGE) throughout the originally published version of this Framework report in March 2018. This file has been updated to reflect the change throughout.\nwww.rf.org | 4\nusers. While the GHG tax is paid only for process emissions from any sector and for the carbon content of fossil resources, the economic impact of the tax flows through the chain linking suppliers, producers and customers to affect the entire economy. GGI is a useful administrative tool to follow added costs of products that suppliers charge their customers (based on applying the GHG tax rate to GGI).\nIn this Framework, products to be exported would be eligible for rebates determined by the rate (in US$ per tonne of product): (GGI) times (GHG tax). For imported products, GGI (as determined for foreign producers) provides the basis for the import charge by applying the US GHG tax (see Table 1). This is discussed further immediately below in general, and for specific sectors at length in Section 5 and with examples for many EITE sectors in the Compendium (see footnote 3).\nThe Framework determines rebates for exported products and charges on imported products using the same approach for both. When a specific manufacturer in an EITE sector transforms products from many suppliers into new products, they must reallocate the total cumulative GHG emissions from all inputs plus GHG emissions from on- site operations (if any) to the determine cumulative GHG emissions (GGI) for products they produce.\nTo manufacture products, EITE industries (by definition) require energy and other energy-intensive inputs, notably electricity and commercial fuels in all sectors, and, in some sectors, other energy-intensive materials such as electrodes, oxygen, and hydrogen. When electricity or energy 1s derived from fossil fuels, GHG emissions result as a byproduct. To be clear: utilizing energy from fossil fuels requires a chemical transformation of the hydrocarbon bond through the addition of heat and oxygen: emissions of CO2 occur as an inevitable byproduct. Indeed, in some limited commercial applications CO? is separated from flue gas and sold as a product.\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nSeveral sectors generate additional GHG emissions from extraction and processing of resources, for example from calcination of lime and from venting, flaring or leaks of associated gas produced during extraction and processing of natural gas and crude oil. Emissions depend heavily on the particular natural resources, commercial energy sources and technologies used to create inputs from suppliers and manufacture products. GHG emissions in a given sector can vary considerably not only between firms, but also across domestic facilities and operations of a given firm, depending on their specific circumstances.\n3.1. Methodologies to Determine GHG Emissions\nCentral to our proposal is the concept that rebates for exported products and charges on imports from EITE firms and industries can be determined based on information available from regulatory reporting procedures which exist in many nations, or international guidelines that have been developed and endorsed by many EITE industries. These methods were developed to determine emissions from facilities and operations (e.g., power plants, chemical plants and oil fields). Today, in the United States and many other nations, they provide an established foundation that underpins systems for GHG emissions reporting, taxation and allowance requirements in cap-and-trade systems.\nOver the past two decades many industrial sectors, especially EITE sectors, have also developed voluntary GHG measurement and reporting guidelines that have been endorsed by international industry associations (e.g., see\nwww.rf.org | 5\nWRI/WBCSD GHG Protocols).° Their development involved collaboration with non- governmental organizations and interactions with government regulators. These guidelines are widely used by firms to roll up and report corporate GHG emissions from facilities and activities around the globe, e.g., in Corporate Annual Reports and as a basis for voluntary submissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project. The methods undergo ongoing scrutiny and are revised and updated from time to time. Those involved from industry interact with regulatory authorities around the world as they develop and revise “official” procedures. Methods account for operational emissions (often referred to as Tier 1) from activities to produce natural resources (e.g., to extract and process coal, oil and gas) and manufacturing activities to produce specific products or product slates including from the use of commercial fuels. They also account for indirect emissions, e.g., from purchased electricity (Tier 2). After many years of experience including regular interactions between industry, government and non-state actors, methodologies required by regulatory processes and the voluntary guidelines adopted by EITE industries yield consistent results,’ although they are often tailored to different boundaries and accounting in different settings. They are available for use by firms in any nation, and firms that export EITE products are typically multi-national companies with the expertise and capacity to utilize these guidelines in nations without regulatory protocols.\nMethodologies and issues will be discussed in greater detail below, and in Section 5 and the Compendium where we consider specific sectors. For rebates and import charges, available methods for entire\n6 Through the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) work with businesses to develop standards and tools that help companies measure, manage, report and reduce their carbon emissions. http://www.ghgprotocol org\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\nfacilities must be extended: first, to accumulate GHG emissions from the entire supply chain to produce products, and second, to allocate the share of emissions assigned to specific products of a given producer’s facilities. In general, we find that it is possible to estimate these emissions without having to examine details for every step in the sequence to manufacture each product. The first few, very energy-intensive steps usually account for the vast majority of GHG emissions emanating from a particular facility or manufacturing chain. Once those are accounted for, emissions for final products can be allocated using simple rules, e.g., based on the carbon content of the processed fuel, or average emissions per unit weight of precursors incorporated in the final product, e.g., raw steel transformed to bars or pipes. In this respect, the approach is analogous to the logic of applying border adjustments only to EITE industries with significant emissions, rather than to exports and imports from all sectors and their products, e.g., automobiles and laptop computers. This restricted focus serves the dual environmental and administrative goals of reducing GHG emissions to limit risks from climate change while also limiting administrative costs and complexity.\nWhile it will be possible to identify the firm responsible for producing exported or imported products, it may be difficult and even counterproductive to identify the facility where specific products originate. For example, fuels distributed in a pipeline may originate from different refineries of many companies, and a given manufacturer may produce identical products in several plants that utilize electricity from sources based on renewables, nuclear, gas or coal. US exporters\n7 Mark A. Cohen and Michael P. Vandenbergh (Energy Economics 34 (2012) S53—S63: The Potential Role of Carbon Labeling in a Green Economy.\nwww.rf.org | 6\nwww.rf.org | 7\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\ncountries that have not yet implemented detailed GHG regulatory reporting requirements for industrial activities.\n3.2. Issues in WTO Compliance\nOur approach to border adjustments for products from EITE industries is based on providing a rebate for exports by US manufacturers and applying a charge on imports from foreign firms. Both the rebate and import charge are determined by applying the US GHG tax rate (in $ per tonne CO2e) to GGI: Cumulative GHG Emissions resulting from process emissions during production and (in the case coal, oil and natural gas) the carbon content of the produced resource.\nThe border adjustment process has been designed to satisfy several criteria:\ne Rebates and import charges are determined in the context of the indirect domestic tax on GHG emissions associated with the product; Import charges are applied without discrimination based on national origin; Objective international standards are used to determine domestic rebates for exports and border charges on imports; Rebates for products do not exceed the amount of the indirect domestic tax; Import charges on products do not exceed the amount of the indirect domestic tax on like products.\nwould have an incentive to claim rebates for products sourced from their most GHG- intense plants, while foreign firms would be assessed lower import charges if they could claim that exports to the United States originated from their least GHG-intensive facilities. To avoid “gaming” that might be done in these cases, and in recognition of the lack of clear provenance in many cases, we propose that products exported by US companies should be assigned emissions based on the average for the firm’s entire domestic production of that product, or, if specific firm averages are not available, then based on the average for the entire US sector. Similarly, we would assign emissions for imported products based either on the average emissions for that product across the entire sector in the country of origin, or across the entire company if such information is available.\nNational GHG inventories required by the UNFCCC provide another official source of information on GHG emissions that may be useful in this context. These inventories, based on guidelines® produced and updated from time to time by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), include information for many sectors and activities. However, they do not extend to emissions from particular facilities or firms. Nonetheless, they provide national information that would be especially valuable to help estimate average emissions for products in many EITE sectors in developing\n8 See http://www. ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/index.html. The development of the new Methodology Report to refine the current inventory guidelines (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories), is being carried out by the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFT) in accordance with the decision taken at the 44th Session of IPCC in Bangkok, Thailand, in October 2016. The final draft of this new Methodology Report titled “2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” (2019 Refinement) will be considered by the IPCC for adoption/acceptance at its Plenary Session in May 2019.\nwww.rf.org | 8\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nnon-discrimination on the basis of national origin of imports.\nIf adopted, the Framework proposed here could cause other countries to consider whether and how they might provide relief (from their own national GHG policies) to firms that export to the US. Indeed, if the United States adopted this approach it might encourage other nations also to adopt the more efficient GHG tax as a basis to facilitate exports to the United States and other nations that adopt this approach.\nAs stated above, for the United States and other nations that adopt it, in essence, this proposal fundamentally shifts costs to mitigate emissions connected to international trade from a system based on where goods are produced to one where they are consumed.\n3.3. Upstream GHG Tax with Border Adjustments for Exports and Imports\nIn the US, but not in all nations, the majority of GHG emissions (over 80 percent) occur as CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels. However, if the ultimate objective is to achieve radical, long-term reductions that have been proposed as the goal of GHG policy, other sources, such as cement production, and other gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, must also be addressed. Indeed, the upstream GHG tax should also apply to activities that generate significant GHG emissions, such as land use change, that are not EITE sectors.\nIn our Framework, the direct statutory incidence of the upstream tax falls only on a few EITE sectors: producers of coal, oil and natural gas and a few others, but all sectors experience its economic consequences based on their use of fuels, electricity and, in some cases, other energy-intense inputs such as oxygen and hydrogen. For example, besides paying the upstream GHG tax, producers of coal, oil and gas would pay more for the electricity, commercial fuels and other energy- intense inputs they use to extract and initially process fossil resources. As key downstream\nWTO tules allow nations to provide rebates for the cost of indirect taxes on products and to apply a charge to imports that is not in excess of the indirect tax on domestic producers. This Framework does not address environmental exceptions under the WTO, but we believe that it should be compatible with them—this will be addressed in a companion report. The environmental exceptions cannot be used if, in fact, border adjustments were implemented in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or that is a disguised restriction on trade. Arguments have been made that some procedures proposed and even implemented to address border issues in some nations jeopardize their WTO compatibility.\nTo apply equally to all nations this approach does not take account of GHG policies, regulations and costs already imposed in the exporting nation—which differ enormously among nations that trade with the US. While this runs counter to many discussions of border adjustments, it also has advantages. In particular, it is extremely difficult to assess the actual cost of GHG policies in many nations, let alone their cost to specific products. No nation yet applies the economist’s ideal policy—and the one assumed in this proposal—of an economy- wide tax on all GHG emissions: an actual GHG “price.” Most nations, including the US, utilize a portfolio of policies that include a variety of mandates, subsides, and end-use efficiency regulations, as well as some price- based approaches. Cap-and-trade systems result in a variable, volatile, unpredictable GHG price on the facilities in some sectors. Evaluating the cost of these policies for specific products gives rise to a quagmire of challenges. It would be exceedingly difficult, for example, to determine the amount of a cap-and-trade credit appropriate to reduce the US import charge on products exported from a country with a cap-and-trade system that includes substantial allowances for various EITE industries. Such credits run the risk of violating Most Favored Nation principles of\nexamples, electricity producers would pay no GHG tax, nor would refiners pay a GHG tax on crude oil they process, fuels they produce, or electricity, commercial fuels, and other energy-intensive materials they utilize. Nonetheless, because of the upstream tax, refiners would pay more for crude oil and natural gas, and power plants for fossil fuels that they utilize. Consequently, their customers—including upstream producers of oil, gas and coal—would pay more for purchased fuels and electricity (see Figure 1)\nDetermining precisely the economic impact of the upstream GHG tax on the price producers charge their customers may be an impossible task, since prices in commodity goods fluctuate from day-to-day for many reasons. Nonetheless, as a policy for GHG regulation, in analogy with VAT, we require that producers determine and pass through to their customers GGI (tonnes CO2e per tonne of product and tonnes COze per MWh for electricity) for products they sell. In this framing, it is important to distinguish between the GHG tax paid by those EITE manufacturers that emit GHGs in their on-site production processes (and producers of coal, oil and gas for the carbon content of produced resources) and the amount eligible for rebates to all EITE firms that export. The latter includes both the GHG tax (if any) paid by the producer of exported products, and also the cumulative GHG emissions GGI passed- through the supply chain leading to products purchased by the manufacturer, e.g., from purchased coal, crude oil and natural gas, electricity, commercial fuels and energy- intensive materials they use. GGI builds up over the supply chain in a straightforward analogy to similar methods used for VAT as described in Section 3.6 below.\nUpstream GHG Tax\nOnly a few EITE sectors, notably coal, oil and gas producers, directly pay the GHG tax; this section focuses on them. The Compendium discusses a few other sectors, e.g., cement, aluminum and steel that would also pay the direct tax because they emit CO2\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nfrom processing limestone or alumna or consuming electrodes. Because the carbon content of fossil fuels is taxed before combustion, no tax is paid at the downstream point of emission from use of commercial fuels to produce electricity or for other purposes. The tax is prepaid on the carbon content of fossil resources as they are produced at the mine-mouth for coal and wellhead for oil and gas. Process emissions subject to the GHG tax also occur from upstream operations to produce coal, oil and gas during extraction and initial processing of the natural resources, for example, from venting or flaring of associated gas and fugitive emissions from leaks. Unlike border adjustments that must be defined for specific products, the upstream GHG tax applies to process emissions from entire upstream facilities and operations, and to the carbon content of produced fossil resources.\nAn offset fee, paid at the same rate as the GHG tax, would be available to manufacturers who capture CO? emissions from fossil fuels and permanently store them as part of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) operations. “Permanent” storage will be defined by permitting procedures for CCS that will have to address the potential for leakage over periods ranging from centuries to longer. The Framework could also provide an offset fee for fossil resources that are converted into durable products like concrete. As with “permanent” for CCS, that would depend on setting agreed criteria for “durable.”\nRebates for Exported Products\nThe methodologies described above (Section 3.1), provide objective information to assess GHG emissions from facilities and operations in EITE industries, and to consolidate results to determine firm or sector- wide average emissions. In the United States, such information has been available for many years and provides a basis to levy the upstream GHG tax. To determine rebates for products we must extend the methods by allocating cumulative GHG emissions from all inputs and operations of entire facilities to the\nwww.rf.org | 9\nproducts they create. In situations, such as a steel mill or petroleum refinery, where a plant produces an entire slate of products, it is often appropriate to allocate emissions based on the tonnage of products produced, or on their carbon content in the case of processed fossil fuels. The Compendium discusses more complex circumstances that occur in sectors where facilities produce multiple products using a variety of technologies and processes that require separate approaches. In any case, existing methods can be extended to provide information to determine how facility-wide emissions and cumulative GHG emissions from suppliers would be apportioned across the portfolio of products they produce—although this almost certainly will require effort by firms, trade associations and regulators to develop appropriate, agreed information and procedures in EITE sectors, as discussed below.\nThe Framework calls for the use of firm- wide or, in the absence of firm-wide data, sector-wide national averages to determine the amount of a potential BTA. The firm-wide average avoids concerns with provenance of products or firms shifting sourcing for domestic sales and exports to maximize rebates or reduce import charges (as described in Section 3.1), it appears to be more appropriate to use domestic averages for an entire firm. This requires the firm to roll up average cumulative emissions GGI for their domestic production of each exported product. Because of the large variety of production methods employed in many sectors, and the regional variation of emissions associated with sources for purchased electricity, it seems appropriate to use firm, not sector averages to determine the domestic rebate for specific products. To meet WTO criteria, it is essential that the rebate for exported products does not exceed the value associated with cumulative GHG emissions of producers (US GHG tax times GGI for the product). Firm-wide averages could simplify the issues associated with provenance of exported products.\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nNote that, even at a modest starting level of $20 per tonne COz, the scale of domestic GHG taxes, export rebates and import charges would be very significant. With respect to taxes on fossil resources, in 2016 US energy- related CO2 emissions (approximately 5.2 billion tonnes CO2) would have yielded revenues of 100 billion US$. Exports, on the other hand (using a simple estimate—based only on carbon content, not a complete analysis of cumulative GHG emissions and only for petroleum products) of crude oil and other petroleum liquids in 2016 amounted to just over five million barrels per day, and imports to about 10 million barrels per day— with trends showing exports rising and imports falling. Export rebates in 2016 would have been about 20 billion US$ and import charges 40 billion US$. Thus, responsible administrative agencies would be processing domestic taxes, rebates and import charges of many billion US$ per year.\nBorder Charge on Imported Products\nIn this Framework, both the charge on imported products and the rebate for exported products are determined in the same fashion based on objective, accepted methodologies that do not discriminate against any nation, nor favor domestic producers over imports. The charge for products of a given firm would be assessed on exported products based on the national average for emissions GGI (in COze per tonne) from the entire domestic production of that product by the firm, or on the national average for the entire sector if firm-specific averages are not available. As described above in Section 3.1, a variety of internationally accepted methodologies exist to determine GHG emissions and they are essentially similar in their provisions. Moreover, many, but not all, nations have already implemented regulatory requirements to report GHG emissions by EITE industries. The same approach applied to US domestic manufacturers in a given sector, would be used to allocate emissions to their product slate, yielding COze emissions per tonne of product exported to the US.\nwww.rff.org | 10\nwww.rff.org | 11\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\npaid on similar products that are sold for domestic use.\nThe border adjustment of the upstream GHG tax on imports and exports of products from EITE sectors could raise concerns about potential violations of the rules of the WTO. The WTO’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) prohibits countries from providing export subsidies for their products. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) restricts the ways in which WTO-member nations impose taxes on imported products. Both agreements, however, follow the “destination principle,” which permits taxes to be border adjusted on products based on where they are consumed rather than where they are produced.? Moreover, both agreements permit the “downstream” border adjustment of an “upstream” internal tax on products so long as the tax 1s designed and implemented in a nondiscriminatory manner. Accordingly, a properly designed GHG tax would be permissible under the relevant rules of the WTO.\nBorder Adjustment of the GHG Tax on Exports\nAlthough the SCM Agreement generally prohibits export subsidies,!° the prohibition does not apply to the rebate of taxes imposed on “like” domestic products that are consumed domestically.!! Annex I contains an “TIlustrative List of Export Subsidies” that includes “(g) the exemption or remission, in respect of the production and distribution of exported products, of indirect taxes in excess\n10 See SCM Agreement, Article 3.1 (prohibiting subsidies contingent on export performance).\n11 See SCM Agreement, n.1 (“the exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for domestic consumption, or the remission of such duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued, shall not be deemed to be a subsidy.”’)\nThe border charge would impose the US GHG tax rate to products imported from other nations based on cumulative GHG emissions (GGI) required to produce them, and, in the case of fuels, to combust them. To avoid issues associated with determining (or shifting) the provenance of produced goods, emissions would be determined based on the company’s average for products manufactured in the exporting nation. If company-specific information is not available for an exporting company, then average data for the entire exporting country would be estimated and used to create import charges. Estimating and assigning emissions to imported EITE products (e.g., default national averages or values for specific production processes and commercial fuel and electricity use) will be central in determining the import charge for such products.\n3.4. WTO Rules and Border Tax Adjustments (A Deeper Dive)\nThe rules of the WTO permit internal taxes and charges to be “border adjusted” — i.e. rebated on exported products and applied to imported products. Significantly, BTAs need not be imposed or rebated directly on the product that is subject to the domestic tax, but may also be imposed or rebated on manufactured goods that incorporate the product—including energy inputs—that is subject to the domestic tax. BTAs on imports and exports, however, may not exceed the tax\n9 See WTO Secretariat, Taxes and Charges for Environmental Purposes — Border Tax Adjustment, WT/CTE/W/47, para. 36 (2 May 1997)(“WTO provisions on border tax adjustment follow the destination principle for [product based] taxes’’), available at\nhttps://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S0O 09-\n__\nDP.aspx?language=E&CatalogueldList=6608&Current CatalogueldIndex=0&FullTextHash=&HasEnglishReco rd=True&HasFrenchRecord=True&HasSpanishRecord =True.\nof those levied in respect of the production and distribution of like products when sold for domestic distribution. a”\n“Indirect taxes” are defined broadly to cover essentially all taxes on products, including “sales, excise . . . value added, transfer... and all taxes other than direct taxes and import charges.”!? This provision indicates that the remission of taxes on fossil fuels “used in the production and distribution” of exported EITE products would be permissible so long as the remission was not “in excess of” the taxes levied on products if they were sold for domestic use.\nParagraph (h) of Annex I even more explicitly permits rebates of taxes on energy inputs into exported products with regard to “prior stage-cumulative indirect taxes” (PSCI taxes).!3 “Cumulative” indirect taxes are defined as “multi-staged” taxes that are not credited at subsequent stages of the production process.!4 PSCI taxes may be remitted if they are “levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product....”!5 Inputs that are consumed in the product process include not only inputs that are\n12 SCM Agreement, n.58.\n13 Footnote 58 defines “prior-stage” indirect taxes as “those levied on goods or services used directly or indirectly in making the product,” which would describe taxes on fossil fuels used in making EITE exported products. The inclusion of taxes on services indicates that there is no requirement that the prior stage tax be levied on goods that are physically incorporated in the exported product.\n14 SCM Agreement, n.58.\n15 SCM Agreement, Annex I, (h). para.\nwww.rff.org | 12\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\n“physically incorporated” into the exported product, but also “energy, fuels and oils used in the production process....”!6 Accordingly, depending on how an upstream tax on fossil fuels was structured, it could be rebated on downstream exported products from EITE sectors under paragraph (g) or (h) of the SCM Agreement so long as the export rebate is not “in excess” of the taxes paid upstream.\nHere, the proposed structure of the domestic tax—applied both at the wellhead or mine mouth on coal, oil and gas (and therefore paid by upstream producers) and applied to (and paid by) the limited number of EITE industries that emit COz2 in their production process—raises a number of complications regarding the export rebate. With respect to the upstream tax on coal, oil and gas, the complication is raised by the fact that rebates are permitted for taxes “borne by the product” while the EITE products will only indirectly bear the tax through increased costs for electricity produced using coal, oil or gas. Moreover, because the tax is paid once at the wellhead or mine mouth, difficulties may arise in demonstrating that the tax is “cumulative” for purposes of falling under the permission\n16 SCM Agreement, n.61. The An earlier version of the SCM Agreement—the 1979 Subsidies Code—permitted export BTAs for PSCI taxes only when the taxes were imposed on inputs that were “physically incorporated” into the exported product. The relevant language in paragraph (h) was modified during the Uruguay Round negotiations to permit the remission of taxes on inputs—including energy and fuels—that were “consumed in the production of the exported products.” The change was made in response to a proposal by India, which argued that permitting the rebate only of taxes on physically incorporated inputs “places at a disadvantage countries with multi-stage cumulative tax systems vis-a-vis those with value added tax systems [covered under paragraph (g)] as in the latter, there is no impediment to the exporter collecting full credit for all prior stage taxes paid on inputs.” WTO Secretariat, Negotiating History of Footnote 61 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, para. 10, WT/CTE/W/16 (Dec. 1, 1995).\nprovided in paragraph (h) of Annex I.!7 However, the concern of these provisions is to ensure that subsidies are not hidden through rebates for unseen inputs. It will thus be critical to structure the export rebate in a transparent manner and to ensure that the amount of the rebate does not exceed the amount of the charge effectively imposed on domestic products.\nBorder Adjustment of the GHG Tax on Imports\nThe GATT similarly permits border adjustment of internal taxes on imported products. Article II of the GATT restricts the imposition of customs duties (tariffs) on imported products to the rates specified in schedules annexed to the GATT.!8 Under Article II:2, however, a charge “equivalent to an internal tax” imposed on a competitive domestic product may be imposed on an imported product or, significantly, on “an article from which the imported product has been manufactured or produced in whole or in part.” Thus, GATT Article II:2, like the SCM Agreement, permits the border adjustment of prior stage taxes on inputs to products that are traded internationally.\nArticle II] of GATT similarly recognizes the ability of governments to border adjust on imports taxes that are imposed on inputs used in producing competitive domestic products.\n17 Cumulative taxes generally thought of multi- are as stage taxes levied where there is no mechanism for subsequent crediting of the tax if the goods or service subject to the tax at one stage of production are used in a succeeding state of production. See, A. Hoerner and F Muller, Carbon Taxes for Climate Protection in a Competitive World, prepared for the Swiss Federal Office for International Economic Affairs (June 1966), at 36.\n18 See GATT Article II:1.\n19 Under GATT Article II:2, charges levied imported on products must be imposed “consistently with the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article III...”\n20 GATT Article III:2 (emphasis added).\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nBTAs pursuant to GATT Article II:2 must comply with Article III:2,!9 which states that imported products “shall not be subject, directly or indirectly, to internal taxes or other internal charges of any kind in excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to like domestic products.”2° The reference to taxes imposed “indirectly” encompasses taxes on “raw materials used in the product during the various stages of its production.’”’2! As with export BTAs under the SCM Agreement, imports BTAs under GATT may not be imposed in a discriminatory manner—1.e. “in excess” of the taxation imposed on like domestic products.?2\n3.5. Specification of EITE Industries and Information to be Reported\nThe concept of EITE industries has existed for some time, but it remains unclear exactly how they should be defined, and systems differ between nations with different GHG policies. Nearly a decade ago, H.R. 2454 (the Waxman-Markey Cap-and-Trade legislation) included criteria to determine US industrial sectors eligible for relief in international trade under that cap-and-trade proposal and based on GHG emissions from facilities and operations, not products. An interagency task force led by EPA then identified 46 sectors”\n21 Japan—Customs Duties, Taxes and Labelling Practices on Imported Wines and Alcoholic Beverages, L/6216 - 348/83, para. 5.8 (adopted on 10 November 1987).\n22 If import BTA held to be inconsistent with an were GATT Articles I or III, it could still be permissible under Article XX, which provides exceptions for measures that are “necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health” (XX(b)) and measures “relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources . . . “ (XX(g)). A discussed above, however, properly a designed BTA should be permissible without recourse to Article XX.\n23 The Effects of H.R. 2454 International on\nCompetitiveness and Emission Leakage in Energy-\nwww.rff.org | 13\nwithin the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that were presumptively eligible.\nThe Framework here requires additional information from EITE sectors beyond what was required for H.R. 2454, and requires information from additional sectors to track cumulative GHG emissions from producers to their products across the entire supply chain. Consequently, the Framework includes Oil & Gas Production, Petroleum Refining, Coal Production and Electricity as covered EITE sectors. There are several reasons to include them. First, each of them creates products that are exported from and imported to the United States and each of them are energy-intensive. Second, conditions have changed dramatically over the past decade, notably for oil and gas, with the United States now exporting significant and growing amounts of crude oil, finished petroleum products and LNG. Third, and most importantly, the Framework requires additional information on emissions of these and the other EITE sectors. To implement the Framework as applied to products, producers will need to know the cumulative GHG emissions (GGI) for inputs from their suppliers, and to determine and communicate them for products they sell.\nMost of the information required is currently available, though not all of it is published or communicated in suitable form. For example, neither federal regulation nor all states require that US electricity suppliers provide customers with information on GGI (in this case: COze per MWh)—although that information is submitted to and published by the US EPA. Manufacturers and their national associations will have an incentive to provide this information because it forms the basis to claim rebates for exports and to impose import\nIntensive Trade-Exposed Industries (December 2, 2009). https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016- 07/documents/interagencyreport_competitiveness- emissionleakage.pdf\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\ncharges on products that may otherwise enjoy a competitive advantage.\nFacilities and operations in US EITE sectors already report a great deal of the information necessary to implement the Framework. Industrial facilities and power plants are required to report GHG emissions (and other information) to the US EPA. This information for facilities is available at EPA’s web sites for the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program” and for power plants at The Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID).*° However, sectors and regulators will need to consider what, if any, additional information and allocation methods would be needed to apply available information on GHG emissions for facilities to determine GGI for the products they produce, and how to provide that information to customers, primarily business-to-business customers, to implement the Framework.\nOne of the reasons for this study is to help to lay the groundwork to implement the Framework and to encourage US firms and trade associations in EITE sectors (as defined here in Section 3.5) to develop voluntary procedures to produce and share information on cumulative GHG emissions. Voluntary pilot efforts—perhaps public-private partnerships—in this area would help suppliers, producers, competitors, customers and regulators begin to understand the implications, challenges and benefits of developing such an upstream approach for border adjustments. Even in a preliminary, voluntary form, better information on GHG emissions required to produce products would increase transparency with regard to national GHG policy. In particular, it would provide the public, entrepreneurs and innovators with information that would inform their decisions and actions now. The information on\n24 https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do\n25 https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation- resource-integrated-database-egrid\nwww.rff.org | 14\ncumulative GHG emissions (GGI) will also inform citizens and consumers of the impact of the upstream tax paid only by a few businesses on the many downstream products purchased by consumers (e.g., gasoline }— though not everyone will regard this as a good idea.\n3.6. Border Adjustments in the Framework of a Cumulative Emissions Charge\nTable 1 (discussed above) explains the terms and definitions in the proposed Framework to account for upstream cumulative GHG emissions along the supply chain leading to products in EITE sectors, and how they can be used for rebates on exported products and to impose charges on imports.\nThe following example from petroleum fuel products makes clear that GGI can be materially greater than the carbon content of the fuels. Conventional petroleum fuels manufactured anywhere in the world have essentially identical carbon content. For example, a gallon of gasoline contains 2.42 kg carbon that would release 8.89 kg of CO2 upon combustion; while a gallon of jet fuel contains 2.61 kg carbon that would release 9.57 kg of CO2*° (these values are for petroleum fuels without added biofuel). GGI includes contributions from a refinery’s process emissions (if any) and from inputs to the refiner from other manufacturers, e.g. crude oil, electricity and commercial fuels. These can differ significantly depending on how crude oil was extracted, processed and transformed into a product slate. Life cycle analyses?’ show that, on average in the US, emissions (CO2ze) associated with production and refining of crude oil add another 20 percent (1/3 from production, 2/3 from\n26 For convenient list of fuels and emissions a see: www.rff.org/blog/2017/calculating-various-fuel-prices- under-carbon-tax\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\nrefining) to those from combustion of petroleum fuels, while in Canada production and refining of oil sands on average adds 30 percent. So, on average, GGI for gasoline or other finished products would be at least 20 percent higher than a value based solely on its carbon content. Moreover, GGI varies considerably depending on the particular resource produced, emissions associated with purchased electricity, and the product slate of the refinery. For commodity products like gasoline sold by a distributor, where profit margins for end-use sales are only a few percent, the variation from different suppliers could be an important determinant of competitiveness. Similarly, GGI for electricity suppliers will vary significantly and have an impact on the amount of the GHG charge passed on to EITE producers depending on the source of fuel and technology used to produce electricity.\n4. Cross Cutting Issues: Electricity, Co- Generation and Recycling\nThis section describes, in general, how the Framework addresses three important cross- cutting issues that affect nearly every EITE sector: electricity, co-generation and recycling.\n4.1. Electricity\nBecause every EITE sector relies to some extent on electricity as an input, an upstream GHG tax will alter the competitiveness of domestic producers of electricity and sectors that use electricity. To date, discussions of border adjustments in the United States have always considered the need to address the implications of electricity, especially since lower-cost, GHG-intense electricity in many developing nations could create competitiveness issues. This is incorporated in\n27 See Canadian Oil Sands: Life-Cycle Assessments of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Richard K. Lattanzio, March 10, 2014, Congressional Research Service https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42537.pdf\nwww.rf.org | 15\nthe Framework by including electricity as an EITE sector. In practice, the key to implementation is to require that electricity suppliers provide the relevant information: GGI (COze per MWh) to their customers. Information on direct emissions from power plants (CO2 per MWh, not CO2ze) is already reported to the EPA by suppliers (as described above in Section 3.5); however, electricity suppliers are not currently required to communicate that information to their customers. For this Framework, as described in the previous section, electricity suppliers would need to know and report not only the carbon content of their fuels, but also the cumulative GHG emissions required to produce them. For this reason, we would require electricity suppliers (like all other EITE suppliers) to determine and communicate cumulative emissions GGI to customers, especially those in other EITE industries.\n4.2. Cogeneration\nCombined heat and power, presents an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity exists because operations in many EITE sectors require copious amounts of process heat to carry out transformations. Once generated to supply the heat necessary for its primary purpose, e.g., generation of steam for use in several processes throughout the facility, in many settings the residual, otherwise wasted heat can be used to co- produce electricity that can then be used in the facility or, when regulations allow it, sold for use by others outside the facility. Cogeneration dramatically improves the overall, combined energy efficiency to produce steam and electricity, compared with producing them separately. The challenge arises because of ambiguity about how to determine the emissions from co-generation facilities and, even more, how to allocate them among products, e.g., electricity and steam.\nWhen a facility such as a refinery implements cogeneration, it does so to take advantage of the residual heat available after producing steam to satisfy the enormous\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\ndemand in numerous units across the entire facility. In this case the cogeneration facility is not managed to optimize profit from its ability to produce two products: steam and electricity, but, rather, to serve the larger need to run the entire facility safely, efficiently and profitably. As well, the cogeneration unit may utilize fuels from internal operations or purchased fuels and electricity acquired to meet the needs of the entire facility. In this situation, it seems appropriate to consider treating the unit as an internal operation that affects overall operating costs and to regard any electricity sold outside the fence to have been generated with zero emissions. That is: none of the GHG emissions from the cogeneration unit, or the inputs from purchased fuels and electricity, should be allocated to the product: electricity sold by the refinery; all of them should be allocated to the slate of petroleum products produced by the entire refinery.\nThe situation would be entirely different for a stand-alone cogeneration facility run by an independent operator, perhaps to provide electricity and heat in some form to a variety of customers in an industrialized locale. In that case, the independent producer should be required to obtain GGI indices for purchased inputs and to specify the basis to allocate them to products it sells to others.\n4.3. Recycling\nMany EITE sectors, e.g., steel, aluminum, pulp and paper, make extensive use of recycled materials. Typically, these require far less energy to be transformed into new products than is required to convert fresh raw materials. However, the gathering process is such that recycled materials from many sources may be combined in such a way that it is impossible to determine their provenance. Consequently, there may be no reliable way to determine values GGI for them. Accordingly, in most cases we recommend that a single US national average should be assigned to recycled materials. However, in some situations other approaches may be\nwww.rff.org | 16\npreferable—details are discussed for several sectors in the Compendium.\n5. Application of the Framework to IIlustrative EITE Sectors\nThis section discusses procedures to determine GHG taxes, and cumulative GHG emissions, export rebates and import charges for products in EITE sectors: first in general and then in more detail for several illustrative sectors. As discussed above in Section 3.5, the information necessary to determine factors required to implement the Framework (primarily the carbon content of fossil resources and fuels, process emission from operations in EITE sectors and the cumulative emissions index: GGI) appears to be available, although not necessarily in convenient or appropriate form. As discussed above this is analogous to the approach used with VAT to track that tax. As an administrative procedure, the Framework determines cumulative GHG emissions using GGI for specific products from specific manufacturers and combines them to determine a national average <GGI > for the firm’s entire domestic production from all its facilities. If the product is exported, then <GGI> X (US GHG tax) is the rate (US$ per tonne) for the rebate. Similarly, for imported products of a specific foreign manufacturer, their domestic average <GGI> is the basis for the import charge rate: <GGI> X (US GHG tax); however, if firm-specific information is not available, then an average for the product based on the entire EITE sector will be used for the import charge.\nFor each sector, the Framework applies to specific manufacturing facilities and operations in the same way. A manufacturer transforms inputs, 1.e., products, from a variety of suppliers into new products that will be sold to customers. The approach requires the manufacturer to determine total cumulative GHG emissions: GHG Total (in tonnes COze), from all inputs and the emissions (tonnes COze) implied by GHG taxes paid (if any) to operate the facility, 1.e., Total Tax divided by GHG charge rate. (Keep\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nin mind that upstream producers of fossil resources “pre-pay” the GHG tax for emissions that will later occur from processing, e.g., by refiners, and combustion by end-users of fuels.) GHG Total is the amount of emissions to be allocated to the entire slate of products produced by the facility. For many sectors, it is appropriate to allocate GHG Total to products by simple procedures, such as by weight in proportion to the weight of all products, or, in the case of produced fossil resources and processed fossil fuels, in proportion to their carbon content. However, for other sectors this may require additional information and procedures.\nAs discussed in the Compendium, and illustrated in Figure 1 for a few sectors, all sectors include contributions to GGI from their use of purchased commercial fuels and electricity, and only a few sectors, notably producers of coal, oil and natural gas, and manufacturers who convert limestone to CO2 and lime, pay upstream GHG taxes. In the United States, the information necessary to determine upstream GHG taxes for facilities and operations and to determine rebates for exported products (GGI) appears to be available in most cases. However, it will need to be combined in new ways, especially to determine allocations for cumulative GHG emissions from suppliers and manufacturers to GGI for products in some sectors and to resolve associated issues, e.g., with cogeneration and recycling. Work will be required to determine GGI for imported products, especially those manufactured in nations without well-developed procedures for firms to measure and report GHG emissions from facilities and operations, or by firms without adequate capacity and experience.\nThe Compendium contains descriptions of the way the Framework could be implemented for Oil & Gas Production, Coal Production, Petroleum Refineries, and Electricity, and includes shorter modules for another 31 EITE sectors. In every case there are elements that must be managed by one or more administrative agencies that would need to be\nwww.rff.org | 17\nwww.rff.org | 18\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nwith both WTO and UNFCCC obligations. The Framework proposed here does that.\nThe Framework proposal describes procedures to implement WTO-compliant border adjustments in the context of an upstream US domestic GHG tax—an indirect domestic tax on products that can be rebated for exports and applied to imports. Border adjustments are based on objective, internationally recognized methodologies to measure GHG emissions from facilities and operations of manufacturers in EITE industries. However, to apply them to products traded in international commerce these methods require extensions as proposed here: 1) to include contributions to GHG emissions from upstream suppliers of products utilized by specific manufacturers, and 2) to allocate GHG emissions from facilities of a given manufacturer to the specific products that they produce. The Framework does this using an efficient administrative tool (analogous to VAT in other settings) to track cumulative GHG emissions from suppliers to manufacturers of domestic products eligible for export rebates and to products imported from foreign nations.\nIn general, the Framework estimates emissions associated with specific products without having to examine each step in the sequence to produce the product. The first few, very energy-intensive steps usually account for the vast majority of GHG emissions in the entire production chain required to manufacture EITE products. Once those are accounted for, emissions for final products can be allocated using simple rules, e.g., based on the carbon content of the processed fuel, or average emissions per unit weight of precursors incorporated in the final product, e.g., raw steel transformed to bars or pipes. This simplification serves the dual environmental and administrative goals of reducing GHG emissions to limit risks from climate change without undue administrative burden.\nThe Framework covers not only CO2 but also emissions of other significant GHGs covered by US regulations. This allows the\nspecified in legislation to implement the proposed Framework. In view of the significant sums involved and the close link to the upstream GHG tax, collection and disbursement of import charges and rebates should be assigned to the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service. Because of its extensive involvement with trade issues, tariffs, domestic and foreign companies and foreign governments, including via investigations carried out in foreign countries, the most logical US federal agency to administer these border adjustment methodologies is the Office of Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. Activities associated with border adjustments would include determining charges for imports and rebates for exports based on approved procedures and receiving information on covered products from affected firms and trade associations. This would also require annual updates of required information recognizing that important changes may occur as technologies and practices by manufacturers evolve, and that these will also affect their suppliers, e.g. of electricity and commercial fuels.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nFor decades, proponents and opponents of actions to address climate change have recognized that ambitious climate policies may shift production in EITE industries to nations with less stringent policies, resulting in leakage of GHG emissions and loss of business, jobs and investment. These concerns continue under the Paris Agreement (2015) because national pledges—most extending to 2030—differ significantly both in stringency and types of policies they use to limit GHG emissions. Proposed remedies typically rely on border adjustments with relief for exports and charges on imports. However, devising WTO-consistent border adjustments has proven to be challenging (see footnote 4). To avoid lengthy, potentially divisive battles between trading partners, it would be desirable to formulate domestic climate policies that are compatible\nGHG tax (in US$ per tonne CO2) to be applied to the full set of emissions expressed as tonnes CO? equivalent (CO2e). To track the flow of cumulative emissions from suppliers to producers in all EITE sectors the Framework includes Oil & Gas Production, Petroleum Refining, Coal Production and Electricity as well as the 46 sectors within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that were determined to be presumptively eligible under H.R. 2454 (2009). Most of the information required for the Framework is currently available and reported to the US EPA, though not all of it is published or communicated in suitable form. For example, neither federal regulation nor all states require that US electricity suppliers provide customers with information on the GHG emissions (CO2e per MWh) associated with their purchase of electricity.\nTo avoid “gaming” that might be done to cherry pick products from the most or least GHG intense manufacturers of firms in specific nations, and in recognition of the lack of clear provenance in many cases, we propose that products exported by US companies, or those imported from foreign firms, should be assigned emissions based on the average for the firm’s entire domestic production of that product, or, if specific firm averages are not available, then based on the average for the entire national sector. This also serves the purpose of assuring for WTO- compliance that rebates for exports do not exceed the domestic tax and that imports are not subject to internal taxes or charges in excess of those applied to like domestic products.\nTo apply equally to all nations this approach does not take account of GHG policies, regulations and costs already imposed in the exporting nation—which differ enormously among nations that trade with the US. While this runs counter to many discussions of border adjustments, it also has additional advantages besides being WTO- compliant. In particular, it is extremely difficult to assess the actual cost of the portfolio of GHG policies used in many\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nnations, let alone their cost to specific products. For the United States and other nations that adopt it, in essence, this proposal fundamentally shifts costs to mitigate emissions connected to international trade from a system based on where goods are produced to one where they are consumed. A companion Compendium discusses how the Framework would be applied in many EITE sectors. In particular, it provides detailed discussions for producers of Coal, Oil & Gas, Electricity, and Petroleum Refining and modules of varying length for 31 other EITE sectors. While much of the required information on GHG emissions appears to be available, it is not in the appropriate form in many cases and will require effort to develop approved procedures to allocate emissions to products and product slates of manufacturers.\nOne of the reasons for this study is to help to lay the groundwork to implement the Framework and to encourage US firms and trade associations in EITE sectors to pro- actively develop voluntary procedures to produce and share information on cumulative GHG emissions. As with development of GHG emissions reporting that began in earnest in the 1990s, this effort will no doubt require several years to understand and find solutions for complications and challenges that will surely arise. International sectoral trade associations and multi-national companies can play an essential role building expertise and capacity in other nations and sharing their experience from efforts in many nations to develop internationally accepted procedures. Both will be invaluable to establish accepted procedures for internationally traded products. Voluntary pilot efforts—perhaps public-private partnerships—in this area would help suppliers, producers, competitors, customers and regulators begin to understand the implications, challenges and benefits of developing such an upstream approach for border adjustments. Such information would increase transparency with regard to national GHG policy. In particular, 1t would provide many actors with information that would\nwww.rff.org | 19\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\ninform their decisions and actions now. The information would also inform citizens and consumers of the impact of the upstream tax paid only by a few businesses on the many downstream products purchased by consumers (e.g., gasoline)—though not everyone will regard this as a good idea.\nFinally, the need to find WTO-compatible procedures for border adjustments is likely to grow as domestic and international climate policies evolve. The ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement will require rapid transformational change at a scale that is difficult to comprehend: one that will surely have growing implications and challenges for trade and investment. On the one hand, trade and international investment will need to work even more effectively than today to develop and deploy advanced technologies on a vast scale. On the other hand, they are likely to exacerbate tensions associated with GHG leakage and jobs, trade and investment. Developing policies and agreed procedures that are compatible with both WTO and UNFCCC obligations will be essential to smooth the transition.\nwww.rff.org | 20\nNot showing feedbacks\nfrom Other Sectors\nPetroleum\nLiquids\noo\nSo\nRefining\nTable 1.

        "pdf_text": "EU Green Deal — Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism EDF Contribution\nThe Climate Law, published by the Commission on 4 March 2020, includes the goal of climate neutrality for the EU by 2050 and suggests an increased climate ambition to reduce GHG emissions by 50-55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Reaching these targets is likely to involve a significant increase in EU ETS carbon price that can lead to carbon leakages. To allow competitive EU industries to decarbonize their processes, EDF supports the principle of a Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism to offer a level playing field between EU industrial products and imports from third countries under less stringent carbon pricing policies.\nThe power sector in Europe is already affected by carbon leakages as fossil fuel based electricity is imported to the EU ETS region mainly from Russian, Ukraine, the Western Balkans and Morocco. Unlike domestically produced electricity, this imported electricity is not subject to carbon pricing which leads to markets distortions and undermines the effectiveness of the EU ETS to decarbonize the power sector. Carbon leakage in the electricity sector should be combatted. A CBA mechanism could be easier to design for the power sector than for others because some methodologies already exist to estimate the carbon content of electricity.\nOther industrial sectors - including electro-intensive industries due to the indirect price of carbon- are likely to be at risk of carbon leakages given their high energy consumption and their exposure to international markets (eg. cement, steel, aluminum, chemicals). In theory a CBA mechanism would be an efficient tool to ensure that all products are subject to a carbon pricing similar to the one applied in the EU and help European industries to decarbonize. From a practical point of view, significant technical (calculation of carbon content of imported goods), legal (WTO compliance), strategic (possible retaliatory measures) and political challenges will necessarily arise during the design and implementation of such a mechanism, which will need to be addressed. An important part of the work will also relate to the selection of sectors subject to this measure. The Commission should conduct an in-depth study on possible impacts of a CBA mechanism on strategic low carbon value chains — mainly renewables and storage — for which imports currently play a role in the development of cost-competitive projects.\nDifferent options can be designed to implement a CBA mechanism, either through a tariff on importations or through the participation to a carbon trading scheme. One possible option is therefore the participation of importers of products from third countries in the EU-ETS to replicate the same conditions as for domestic producers who pay a carbon price. If importers are made subject to the EU-ETS and entitled to purchase allowances, the demand is expected to increase, which could have a significant impact on the EU-ETS market balance and drive prices up. Another option could be a tariff on importations, the level of which varies automatically with the traded EU ETS price to ensure a level playing field. In any case, the EU- ETS must always provide a significant and predictable CO2 price signal that puts the EU on a cost-effective decarbonisation pathway.\nFinally, it should be stressed that CBA mechanisms are not the silver bullet for achieving an ambitious climate goal in the European industry. Other policy tools to mitigate carbon leakages risks and encourage low carbon investments in energy-intensive industrial sectors will be needed for preparing the future. A CBA mechanism should be part of a wider package of complementary policies to achieve carbon neutrality in a cost-efficient and socially acceptable way. Bilateral agreements on climate ambition/policy could be a complementary way to engage other countries in implementing policies to reduce their GHG emissions. As massive investments will be needed in industry to undertake appropriate restructuring of value chains and decarbonize their processes, the EU should also focus on implementing measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in Europe. Support for research and innovation and a climate-driven industrial policy will therefore be crucial in establishing a true EU leadership."

Considering the complicated interplay with ETS, WTO, and current plans to increase EU ambitions in terms of climate, an Impact Assessment is absolutely necessary.\nIf the Impact Assessment is to analyze individual sectors, Grupa Azoty calls on the Commission to include our sector - the fertilizer sector - in the Impact Assessment and stands ready and willing to provide the Commission with any required data.\nBelow, Grupa Azoty lists a number of factors the Commission should investigate when designing CBAM and therefore should include in its Impact Assessment.\nPurpose of the Measure. The single most important issue the Commission should first determine is the exact purpose of the measure. Only once the exact purpose of the measure is ascertained, only then can the detailed structure of the measure be determined, because the former informs the later. Official EU documents and speeches of EU officials suggest a mix of two purposes. On the one hand, suggestion is made that the purpose of the measure is to avoid carbon leakage. On the other, suggestion is made that the purpose is to encourage 3™ countries to increase their climate ambitions. However, both purposes require different measures. The primary tool to avoid carbon leakage have historically been free allowances, therefore the solution to avoid further carbon leakage in context of EU’s increased climate ambitions would need to be based on the free allowances concept. If, on the other hand, the purpose of the measure is to encourage 3 countries to increase their own climate ambitions by using access to the EU market as an incentive, then the mechanism should be a border measure imposing cost on polluting imports. This instrument, however, is not concerned with carbon leakage and therefore does not revolve around the free allowance concept and should be kept separate therefrom.\nCarbon Leakage. If the Commission determines that avoiding carbon leakage is central to the new mechanism, a thorough analysis of carbon leakage that has already occurred since ETS was introduced should be carried out in order to identify the sectors most exposed (and therefore eligible for CBAM) and verify whether existing measures for preventing carbon leakage have been successful.\nIn this context, it is important to note that EU law does not provide a clear definition of what exactly constitutes carbon leakage. Different interpretations of this term lead different stakeholders and institutions to reach different results on whether carbon leakage actually occurs.\nGrupa Azoty therefore ask the Commission to be flexible and inclusive. Specifically, any processes - such as changes in trade or investment patterns - that result in the manufacturing of products consumed in the European Union, or previously produced in the European Union (even if destined for exports) where they had been subject to ETS, to\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nincreasingly take place outside the European Union, where they are not subject to carbon pricing, should be considered carbon leakage. In this sense, replacement of EU production by foreign production should always be considered as carbon leakage, as production is moving away from ETS-imposed carbon pricing. The exact reason for such shifts in trade or investment patterns is not as determinative as its result of avoiding cost of carbon emissions. The physical transfer of EU production facilities to 3\" countries should not be required to determine existence of carbon leakage.' In fact - such transfer will occur only in the most extreme of cases. Most carbon leakage occurs through EU producers losing domestic and exports markets to non-EU/ETS production, as well as investments into new capacities. This loss does not even have to occur within one company: if EU company decreases production, but another foreign company increases production, builds a new foreign production facility to supply the EU market, redirects its existing production to the EU market to replace the production lost by the EU company, or redirects it existing production to a 3 market replacing prior EU exports to that market, that too is carbon leakage as EU production that was subject to carbon pricing is replaced by 3 country production that is not subject to carbon pricing.\nTherefore, while assessing carbon leakage, the Commission should take into account four easily ascertainable data points for the sector and its key products: (1) the volume of production, (2) the volume of imports into the EU;” (3) the volume of exports out of the EU; and (4) list of investments in new production capacities in the sector in both the EU and abroad, in particular in key countries exporting to the EU, especially if they are in close proximity to the EU. This data for the last fifteen years would allow the EC to establish carbon leakage in this sector. For example, if imports into the EU are growing while exports are decreasing, both for the sector as a whole and its main products, and investments in new capacities are taking place outside of the EU at disproportionate rate compared to those in the EU, then carbon leakage is occurring. If the opposite dynamic takes place, then no carbon leakage occurs.\nIn addition, other points need to be clarified. The Inception Impact Assessment states - following the Green Deal Communication - that “[a]s long as many international partners do not share the same climate ambition as the EU, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs when production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction or when EU products are replaced by more carbon- intensive imports.” (emphasis added).\nFirst, it should be determined whether in fact risk of carbon leakage occurs only if “many” international partners do not share the same climate goals as the EU. It may be that even\n1 In this the Commission to precise terminology when referring to carbon sense, we encourage use leakage and avoid phrases suggesting such transfer is required (such as “Carbon leakage occurs when production is transferred from the EU to other countries.”)\n2 In analyzing trade flows, EU should exclude impact that EU trade defence could have volume of any on imports into the EU.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\na very limited number of partners not sharing EU climate goals and therefore not limiting carbon emissions in their territory could lead to significant carbon leakage, if they are in close proximity to the EU. A single or just a few countries with no carbon emission limits could easily become export hubs of carbon-intensive products to the EU market, if the risk is not addressed.\nSecond, some EU documents state that carbon leakage occurs when EU production is replaced by “more carbon intensive imports. ” However, unless exporting country has an an ETS system that is linked to ETS, it is impossible to verify whether imports from non-EU countries are more or less carbon-intensive than EU production. Also, even if imports are just as emission-intensive as EU production, but more competitive due to lack of ETS costs in home countries, the replacement of EU production by such imports also may constitute carbon leakage. The Commission should therefore investigate how carbon leakage is described in its documents related to the new mechanism to ensure consistent messaging.\nFree Allowances. As Grupa Azoty believes that the purpose of CBAM should be exclusively encouraging 3\" countries and 3 country exporters to lower their carbon emissions, CBAM should not affect in any way the current carbon leakage measures, in particular free allowances. Grupa Azoty considers that free allowances do not conflict with CBAM, as any benefits that EU producers get from free allowances can be considered in the value of CBAM measure imposed on imports at the border, considering the emission-intensity of the imported product. For example, the net cost that an EU producer and a 3 country producer with identical production emissions should pay could be analogous. This needs to be emphasized and is key to securing the political support for CBAM: the purpose of CBAM is not to lead to double protection. Its only purpose should be to incentivize 3 countries and exporters to lower their emissions, by imposing a cost at EU border. This is not linked in any way to free allowances. The Impact Assessment should consider how to make this possible in a non-discriminatory way.\nProduction vs. Consumption Emissions. The Commission should study how the fact that most EU countries contribute to greenhouse emissions more by consumption than production,? affects WTO compatibility of any border measures. It seems that since imports, not production, are major contributors to carbon emissions in the EU then a measure targeting imports should be consistent with environmental objectives of lowering carbon emissions.\nSectors. Another key question is what sectors should be covered by the mechanism. The Commission should use a number of objective criteria to select the sectors, to ensure the process is objective, fact-based and not political. Some of the criteria the Commission could use include:\n(1) anticipated/estimated carbon emissions of imports of this sector;\n3\nl.e. consumption emissions for most EU countries higher than production emissions.\nare\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\n(2) attractiveness of the EU market for imports of this sector; (3) historical volume of imports of this sector (import intensity); (4) whether the sector already pays for emission allowances under ETS or whether it has surplus allowances from previous years (i.e., whether the sector actually incurs a cost that is not compensated by current or past free allowances); (5) number of exporting countries and individual exporters supplying the EU market in this sector;* (6) impact on downstream industries (here, one of the key criteria is whether the product is mainly a finished good, or mainly an intermediate product);° (7) type of emissions (direct or indirect),° and (8) production complexity of the sector in terms of calculating emissions.\nThe relative weight and importance of these criteria should be matched to the purpose of the measure: different criteria should be prioritized if the purpose of CBAM is prevention of carbon leakage, and different if the purpose is encouraging 3™ countries to increase their climate ambitions.\nType of the Measure. The Commission should evaluate what type of measure would best accomplish the objective and what features such measure should have. If - regardless of its ultimate objective - the measure is expected to be responsive to the emission-intensity of the imported product, then the measures would have to be devised in a way that allows the authority to establish the emissions related to the specific imported product and impose an adequate duty, cost or levy.\nThe best unilateral measure that the EU can introduce to incentivize 3 countries to reduce their carbon emissions may be an import greenhouse gas emission tariff, the purpose of which is to introduce on imports ETS costs identical to producing in the European Union, inclusive of transport emissions of bringing the product to the EU border.’ The border is the place where emission-intensity of the imported product could most easily be evaluated. The Commission should therefore also study whether it is practically\n4 The smaller the number of exporting countries and exporting companies, the manageable the more system would be in practice when assessing the level of the measure.\n5 Finished goods should be preferred, intermediate products could raise problems with decreasing as competitiveness of the finished goods industry.\n6\nThe mechanism should focus mainly direct emissions, indirect emission too difficult to\non as are properly quantify in a 3 country, EU industry’s emissions depend on their national energy mix (no reliable EU average), and some EU Member States may compensate them nationally in certain sectors, therefore it would be practically difficult to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of imports.\n7\nInclusion of emission from\nis\nthe\nis eliminate emissions.\ntransportation necessary, as objective to Bringing the product to Europe leads to increased emissions, therefore should be included. However, transport emissions within the EU do not have to be included, until EU industry does not incur similar cost.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nfeasible for other forms of the measure, such as an internal consumption tax, to differentiate the value of the levy depending on the products’ emission-intensity.\nVariability of the Measure. The measure’s main feature should be to impose cost on imports that compensates for direct carbon emissions during production of the product and bringing the product to the European Union. This implies that the same type of products could be subject to different level of tariff/tax/duty, depending on their exact production processes, installations, or transportation methods. Only this way a differentiation between “green” products and “polluting” products could be made. Accordingly, the mechanism should allow (1) assessment or verification of the emission intensity of the imported product, and (2) imposition of variable tariff, whose value depends on emission intensity of the product. The Impact Assessment should analyze how to structure a variable duty system that is practicable for the authorities, yet punishes polluting products and rewards the “green” products.\nTwo-Level System. To impose a carbon measure at the border in a non-discriminatory, WTO-complaint manner, that is at the same time practically manageable, the system could be based on a two-level approach.\nFirst level. An estimation of emission-intensity of the product should be carried out, based on publicly available information,® considering the exporting country or region. This evaluation should result in setting up an automatic default value to be used for majority of imports, depending on their origin. A default automatic system is necessary, as the system cannot function with detailed analysis of emission-intensity of every single import. This default value would be added to the EU customs system to be imposed on imports of specific products falling into covered customs codes, assigned to specific exporting countries (countries of origin), together with the regular import tariff. It would function as an “all others rate” in trade defence proceedings.\nSecond level. A system should also be introduced allowing individual exporters claiming lower emission intensity than the default one to prove that they qualify for preferential lower rate or no rate at all. Accordingly, a verification system could be created to allow verification of exporters’ claims of lower emission intensity. This system could be modeled on trade defense proceedings, including exporters’ questionnaires that are later verified on spot by EC staff or a private 3 party certification system.\nThe Impact Assessment should analyze how best to establish the system so a fair duty can be imposed if no additional information on the imported product’s emissions is available, but at the same time how to enable importers to benefit if their imports are verifiably “green”.\n8 This information could be secured from publications, available commissioned studies provided by or interested parties, technical brochures, or even materials collected as part of a public consultation or data gathering process preceding the introduction of the measure, enabling all exporters, their public authorities and other interested parties to contribute.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nSubject Countries. In the Impact Assessment, the Commission should analyze whether all imports of the selected sectors are to be covered by the measure, or only imports from certain polluting countries. If some countries are exempt, the criteria for such an exemption must be determined.\nGrupa Azoty believes it is paramount that the Commission does not exempt any countries a priori, as this (1) could raise WTO discrimination issues (no MFN treatment), (2) would lead to politization of the system (powerful countries could force the EC to exempt them), and (3) would weaken the carbon-reducing incentives of an across-the-board applicable system (formal compliance with environmental criteria would prevail over factual compliance or real cost imposed). Instead, any preferences given to countries lowering emissions should be dealt with within the value of the first level duty described above. For example, a country operating a domestic carbon-pricing system or formally complying with the Paris Agreement could be offered a lower default rate. Or - preferably - a case-by-case analysis should be done for each exporter claiming to be subject to a domestic carbon-pricing system. On spot verifications - similar to those conducted in trade defense cases - could verify that carbon emissions had in fact been paid for in the accounting documents of the producing exporter. The Impact Assessment should analyze which model of considering the exporting countries’ different levels of climate ambitions could be most effective.\nCarbon vs. Greenhouse Emissions. Grupa Azoty also believes that to achieve EU climate objectives, CBAM should not only cover carbon emissions (i.e., carbon dioxide), but all greenhouse gas emissions that are subject to the ETS for the given sector. In the case of fertilizers, this also includes N20.\nTransportation Emissions. If the objective of CBAM is to eliminate or lower emissions generated by EU consumption through pressuring exporters and exporting countries to lower emissions involved in bringing the product to the European Union, then the Commission should consider including in the CBAM not only the emissions generated in the production process of the imported product, but also the transportation emissions generated in bringing the product to the EU border. While EU producers do not pay similar emission cost, they do not have these emissions at all, so WTO non-discrimination principle would be kept. The Impact Assessment should analyze how to quantify such emissions and whether they can be included in a WTO-compatible way.\nForm of Payment. The final issue the Commission should consider is the form of payment of the measure. As the reference for the payment would be emissions per ton of imported product, a price needs to be allocated to each ton of these emissions and method of payment established. As for the method payment, a decision must be made whether it should be cash, an ETS allowance or some quasi-ETS allowances. Requiring ETS allowances from importers could equalize their situation to EU producers, but on the other hand would most likely require increasing the number of allowances available. A cash payment would require establishing a carbon price that is identical to prices paid by EU producers with analogous ability to plan head or hedge for risk, which may be difficult to do. The\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nCommission should therefore investigate whether creation of a system analogous to ETS allowances, but parallel to it could be a possible solution.\nGrupa Azoty thanks the European Commission for the possibility to contribute in this consultation and looks forward to working with the Commission on developing the CBAM concept.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com"

Ensuring a sustainable supply of raw materials is crucial for Europe's industrial leadership and to achieve a climate neutral, resource efficient and competitive European economy. Large investments are needed in industrial transformation, and it is of major importance for economic, employment as well as environmental and climate reasons that European industry remains competitive in the green transition. The fact that a limitation and/or a price on CO2 is missing in important competitor countries outside the EU already has consequences for the Swedish mining, mineral and metal industries today in favor of more carbon intensive production outside the EU, which does not benefit the climate nor the European economy. \nAgainst this background, Svemin welcomes the fact that a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is further considered at EU level. However, the devil is in the details, and in this context Svemin would like to highlight certain key aspects that need to be addressed in the design of a CBAM:\n \tClimate transition and competitiveness must go hand in hand. It is crucial that in the transition to become climate neutral, the industry can maintain and even improve competitiveness. A CBAM must be designed with the overall objective to contribute efficiently to reducing CO2 emissions in a way that is administratively manageable for companies and causes as little trade friction as possible.\n \tIt is crucial that the risk of carbon leakage for companies with export to third countries is addressed. The carbon and investment leakage that we already see today, i.e. that investments are prioritized in other countries with lower climate ambitions and higher CO2 emissions in production, must be addressed. This leakage is likely to increase over time if the EU increases its climate ambitions while other countries do not. Therefore, if the instrument of free allowances in the EU ETS is not compatible with a CBAM, another instrument that tackles the risk of carbon leakage must be developed.\n \tThe indirect costs for industry of a higher electricity price need to be taken into account. The mining and minerals industry in Sweden has adopted a roadmap in order to reach fossil-free mining operations by 2035 and climate neutral metals and mineral processing by 2045. In order to reach these climate targets, electrification is key. This requires access to fossil-free electricity at competitive prices. Svemin’s member companies are mainly established in the Nordic countries, with a very high degree of fossil free electricity. Due to the marginal cost pricing of electricity, the industry still pays the price of the coal, natural gas and oil in the system, even if the electricity is fossil free. The consequence is that switching from fossil fuels to fossil free electricity does not give any price incentives and competitive advantages for the first movers, but rather increased costs due to the increased electricity consumption that follows from moving away from fossil fuels and thus a competitive disadvantage compared to the slow movers. To get the incentives right to benefit the first movers, not punishing them, is crucial for the green transition and to achieve the EU climate targets. \n \tIt is crucial that the existing system remain functional until another solution has been tested and proved effective. A temporary weakening of competitiveness can lead to non-reversible effects that have a negative impact on the economy, the environment and the climate.\n \tParticular attention must be taken to ensure that no distorting effects are created between sectors and value chains in cases where different protection mechanisms would be applied to different sectors, e.g. free allocation of allowances for one sector and a CBAM for another. Ensuring a level playing field is essential for the functioning of the internal market.",

        "feedback": "Amongst the 3 main paths which are usually envisaged (ETS-based, trade measures, tax measures), only the former would allow to reach a sizable result in a relatively short timeframe. Indeed, relying on trade policy (strong application of modernised TDIs, upscaling of tariffs in order to internalise carbon costs, adequacy mechanisms in FTAs...) would either be underwhelming or on the contrary trigger harsh reactions/retaliation; in any case any meaningful move would need bilateral/multilateral negotiations (by definition, painstakingly long). The fiscal pathway is politically/institutionally difficult due to unanimity rule but not totally blocked thanks to the passerelle clause established in the environment title of TFEU; however even in the hypothetical case of a Council green light, it would mean almost starting from scratch to define the tool, so the CBAM would come very late. Yet climate action is needed asap.\nWhich brings us to the ETS approach, ie inclusion of imports: ETS covers « only » a subset of industry, yet those sectors (steel, cement, chemicals, paper, glass...) are responsible for a large proportion of industrial emissions (EU and worldwide). Thanks to the benchmark system already in place, and given the fact that we're only dealing with \"simple\" products and semi-products, calculation of typical carbon footprint is not so complex. With regards to the WTO, a measure that applies to both imports and domestic products should be fully accepted as long as it does not discriminate against imports (« national treatment ») or against imports from particular countries (MFN). From that perspective it appears that moving to a CBAM would necessarily mean getting rid of the much-abused system of free allocation of allowances (currently in place to prevent carbon leakage risk), otherwise it would be a clear discrimination in favour of domestic production. And it would probably make it difficult to pick-and-chose impacted products according to their origin. In any case, and even though it should be possible to devise a prima facie WTO-compatible mechanism, there's always the second layer of argumentation under Article XX (general exceptions)...\nA word of concern however with regards to the ETS as a whole (which explains why certain climate-minded stakeholders are reluctant to create a CBAM relying on it) : first it was demonstrated that the current parameters for Phase IV (especially LRF) are not in line with net-zero in 2050, and currently the Covid-19 crisis (and its consequences on industrial activities) shows that its market-based philosophy can run counter to its long-term goal goal (need of predictably rising CO2 price to change behaviours, but decrease of emissions = less demand of allowances = CO2 price going down). In order to end up with a credible, climatically ambitious and at the same time industrially fair system, an ETS-based CBAM cannot take place without an urgent fix of the ETS itself.\n",

It is needed to achieve the long-term ambitions of EU climate policy while avoiding carbon leakage. CBA can also be seen as a temporary tool whereas the long-term target is to have a global price for carbon. CBA should be based on the whole carbon footprint which takes into account direct emissions, the emissions from electricity production as well as the emissions from the production of raw-materials. If this is not possible in the scoping of CBA, then EU should immediately start preparing standards to set limits for carbon footprint. The timing and products should be the same as for CBA. In the transition towards global climate neutrality, CBA needs to complement the current for carbon leakage preventing measures in the Emission Trading System, i.e. free allocation and compensation for indirect costs.\nCarbon emissions need to be reduced globally\nWith the European Green Deal, the EU aims to be a global leader for the EU leadership in the global climate change mitigation. The target of the Green Deal is to be the first carbon neutral continent by 2050 and to increase the ambition of CO2 reduction to 50...55% by 2030. The ambition level of other countries can be assessed after 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement have submitted their final Nationally Determined Contributions.\nGlobal CO2 emissions continue to grow. In addition to economic growth in emerging markets, this growth is driven by carbon leakage as it is more cost efficient to produce goods in emerging markets with lower environmental costs compared to production in EU. This is evident in the steel market where imports of stainless steel now account for more than 30% of the European steel consumption. At the same time, the steel produced in Asia creates up-to 5 times higher CO2 emissions compared to European producers’ emissions. Avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe.\nCarbon Border Adjustment is essential for the European carbon-neutrality\nTackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant due to the market characteristics of the sector. The 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” and the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive recognize the steel sector as the most exposed sector, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment. Also, the European Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialize in different forms, either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports”.\nAs long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts and the level of ambition between the EU and other countries differs, there is a need to reduce the risk for carbon leakage with effective measures in the short and medium term. This risk has been addressed by granting free allocation and indirect compensation in the EU ETS.\nEU ETS free allocation and indirect compensation are designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, thus tackling the carbon leakage only partly. Carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in the imported products if it takes into account the total carbon footprint. This would incentivize all companies globally to reduce their carbon footprint to remain competitive. CBA could also be an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in the third countries exporting to the EU so that higher emission reductions are delivered globally. The preparation of\noutokumou\nstainless steel @) 7\nhigh performance\ncarbon border adjustment should start with the most vulnerable sectors, such as steel. Especially for stainless steel, it is crucial that Carbon Border Adjustment will take into account the whole carbon footprint\nCarbon Border Adjustment must include the whole carbon footprint to be effective\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design. As long as imports into EU are setting the steel price at lower value and with a bigger carbon footprint, the situation is causing a concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries. At the same time, the situation is counterproductive for the successful implementation of the European Green Deal\nTwo examples on how the level of CBA should be defined\n1 Taking into account the comprehensive product footprint including direct emissions, indirect emissions and the production of raw material (scopes 1, 2 and 3). Considering the entire footprint is needed to create the optimal incentive to improve the carbon footprint of the entire supply chain Setting the level of CBA based on the available data of worst available technology by country. To an importing producer to gain a lower CBA, they would need to provide evidence that they have a smaller carbon footprint than the worst available technology in their home market\nCarbon footprint of Outokumpu and\nChinese stainless producers\nmScope 1 (direct)\nm Scope 2 (indirect)\nmScope 3 (raw materials)\nP|\nSC\nOutokumpu\nThe chart above illustrates the need to include scope 3 into carbon footprint calculation of stainless steel products as a significant part of the product CO2 footprint is typically attributed to scope 3. Including scope 3 could also tackle the risk of source shifting. If it is not possible to take the whole carbon footprint into account the EU needs to set limit values for product carbon footprint. The time-schedule and scoping should be the same as for carbon border adjustment\nReporting and measurement of carbon emissions as part of CBA\nThe reliability of the carbon emission data will be the biggest challenge for CBA. The data submitted by producers should be measured and reported according to a specified protocol and there should be a verification by a third party. The EU should define a standard for the calculation of the total carbon footprint. It would also be possible to use international standards, for example for life cycle assessment and protocols, in the submission of data and in setting limit values\nIn case the provided data would not be enough, there is scientific literature available that the EU could use There are also initiatives done by the EU Commission to study and pilot footprints. For example, the EU has piloted Product Environmental Footprints (PEF) and Organization Environmental Footprints (OEF). A PEF study measures all quantifiable environmental impacts over the life cycle of your product, including emissions to water, air and soil, resource use and depletion, and impacts from land and water use. For the purpose of CBA, only CO2 related data would be used\nChina\nSource: Outokumpu 2020\noutokumpu.com\noutokumpou\nhigh performance stainless steel\nThe current carbon leakage measures are still needed\nUntil the EU has a comprehensive CBA mechanism and enough experience of its functionality, the current tools to reduce the risk for carbon leakage, i.e. free allocation, and indirect compensation, are essential. Even if it is important to develop a border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. Even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future\nA carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. A border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would also decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain\nA carbon border measure should be applied for a transition period, until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and products with low carbon footprint reach a critical mass in the market. At the same time, it is an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that more ambitious reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully used for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies\nEU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the “trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies\nThere is also a need for a long-term regulatory framework for the advanced transition phase and the post- transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire lifecycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at the EU level and at the border\nOutokumpu Oyj, EU Transparency Register ID: 085686030231-69 Salmisaarenranta 11, 00180, Helsinki, Finland\nMore information: Mia Nores, Head of Low Carbon and Energy Efficiency mia.nores@outokumpu.com, +358 44 330 0928\n7 ™\n..\noutokumpu.com"

This would replace the current system whereby free EU emissions trading system (ETS) allowances are granted to certain industrial sectors based on emission benchmarks and, in some member states, state aid is offered to electro-intensive sectors that pay a heavy burden in the form of the higher electricity prices that result from the EU emissions trading system (ETS). Any mechanism must be compliant with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\nWTO compatibility\nWTO case law has not provided rulings on climate taxes. Article XX(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows measures that are “necessary” to protect human, animal or plant life or health. However, would a CBA applied at the EU level make a material contribution towards the global climate objective? Also, are there better policy options that would be less disruptive to trade?\nGATT Article XX(g) allows trade measures that are “related to” the conservation of exhaustible natural resources in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption. It is argued that clean air could be such a natural resource that can be depleted by pollutants, including greenhouse gases (GHGs).\nHere, it should also be noted that Article 3 of the the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) states that climate protection measures should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, or a disguised restriction to international trade.\nA domestic EU tax on carbon-intensive products (e.g. on steel, cement and aluminium), applied equally to imports, is one way forward and is WTO compatible. However, taxation in the EU is a national competence and an EU carbon tax would require unanimity across member states. It is for this reason that the EU adopted the EU ETS and also explains why the Commission is now exploring a CBA mechanism, rather than the carbon border tax that President von der Leyen sought in her mission letters to European Commissioners dated 10 September 2019.\nEURACOAL response\nEURACOAL understands that calls fora CBA mechanism are a logical counterbalance to the EU’s stringent, unilateral policies linked to climate action. We believe that European industrial competitiveness has been severely compromised, although we note that reports for the Commission suggest that this is not the case (e.g. reports of the Carbon Leakage Evidence Project). In 2017, the Commission concluded that, “While at present, ETS costs constitute a very small share of the total costs for industrial sectors covered by the ETS, even for energy intensive industries, the situation\nRue de la Science 14b 1040 Brussels Belgium\nn° d’entreprise 0408.290.816 EU transparency register no. 19853116579-64 +32 2 775 31 70 euracoal@euracoal.eu www.euracoal.eu\nEURACOAL\nmight change in the future ol . The situation has changed and it is for that reason that we support measures to “level the playing field” for EU industry. In fact, such measures are now essential and should apply to all sectors, including the power sector. However, whilst we can see the pros and cons of a CBA mechanism, we remain neutral on whether or not to introduce such a mechanism as there may be better alternatives.\nThe Commission states that, “the main objective of the carbon border adjustment is fighting climate change by avoiding carbon leakage.” EURACOAL believes that another objective of any measure introduced should be to preserve jobs and economic activity in Europe by enabling EU industry to compete on a level playing field.\nCurrently, EURACOAL has not reached a position on a CBA mechanism. We await concrete proposals, but offer some initial views here in our response paper.\n1.

Scope of a CBA mechanism\nTo grant carbon-leakage protection to selected sectors is a market distortion. Other similar but competing sectors, would be disadvantaged. For example, steel, aluminium, cement (concrete), timber and plastics are often interchangeable in construction and product design. Decisions on what materials to use are typically made on a techno-economic basis. It would be a market distortion if EU officials had the power to assess the carbon penalties applied to particular materials for two reasons. Firstly, such assessments could never be “correct” as there is no perfect way to calculate embedded carbon emissions. Secondly, the Commission proposes to apply a CBA only to “selected sectors” which would effectively determine the market competitiveness of selected materials. This is unfair and would discourage the competitive forces that lead to better and more innovative products; CBAs for selected sectors would pre-empt decisions on material choice and might therefore unnecessarily increase carbon emissions when, for example, lightweight steel components produced in the EU are replaced by imported plastic ones.

The Commission would therefore have to fall back on assumed values for the carbon emissions associated with particular processes. Once again, the transparency and fairness of a CBA mechanism would be compromised if arbitrary decisions were taken based on embedded-carbon assumptions. Instead of a level playing field, it would penalise some at the expense of others and have unverifiable and uncertain environmental outcomes. These complexities point to the need for a simpler, more transparent, fairer approach that can be applied more easily to all sectors.\n4. Carbon trade wars\nAny imposition by the EU of a CBA mechanism, or any other form of carbon border taxation, would inevitably lead to a trade war with third countries. We saw this when the USA imposed tariffs on steel, kicking off a trade war which continues today. Other countries would view a CBA as protectionism. It is for the EU to decide if it wants to take this approach to trade, but EURACOAL itself has always championed open and transparent markets with fair competition on a level playing field, the international coal trade market being an excellent example. Of greater concern to EURACOAL today is the import of coal from countries where production is subsidised which competes unfairly against unsubsidised EU producers.\n5.

This can be done by taking the value of any particular trade and imposing a tax based on the overall CO or GHG emissions per unit of GDP of the trading partner.’ No new administration is needed as the carbon tariffs could be added to existing tariffs collected through existing customs arrangements. Country-by-country GHG emission data is available from the UNFCCC, albeit with a three-year delay, and GDP data is available from the World Bank. The rate of carbon tariff, in terms of euros per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCOze), would have to be set unilaterally by the EU or by multi-lateral agreement.\nSuch an approach may also lead to trade wars, but the retaliatory measures would hopefully be limited to third countries imposing import tariffs on goods from the EU at the same rate, based on the EU’s carbon emissions per unit of GDP. In practice, such tariffs would disadvantage poorer nations vis-d-vis wealthier ones who can afford cleaner, more expensive energy sources. As such, it could reduce trade and lead to impoverishment or even resentment.\nThere are no easy answers to encourage the rest of the world to follow the EU and adopt equally tough climate policies. EURACOAL looks forward to a wider debate on this important topic and will reach a position on a CBA mechansim after a proper internal debate of a concrete proposal from the Commission.\n1 April 2020\n> e) / (€/tCO.e) Tariff (€) = value of goods (€) x national GHG emissions (tCO GDP (€) x carbon tariff\n3"

Repsol welcomes the opportunity given by the Commission to provide input to the publication of the inception impact assessment on the Carbon border adjustment mechanism of March 4th, 2020.\n\nUnder its commitment to lead the energy transition, in line with the Paris objectives and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, Repsol is the first energy company to make the commitment to achieve net zero emission by 2050. This target includes emissions from both our production and our products, so we have therefore established intermediate goals in 2025, 2030, and 2040 (https://www.repsol.com/imagenes/global/en/ON02122019_repsol_strategy_against_climate_change_tcm14-170857.pdf).\n\nRepsol welcomes that the preliminary draft ideas over the Carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) shared by European Commission already makes clear the intention to balance both desirable environment objectives together with the required maintenance of a strong and competitive EU-based industry.\n\nLikewise, Repsol considers that CBAM should be understood as part of an integral review of the current regulatory and tax regime applicable over the energy system, so welcomes that EU Commission indeed states the required integration between the regime settled therein and the envisaged review of the Energy Taxation Directive, all comprised within the objectives and reforms derived from the so-called “EU Green Deal” initiative.\n\nAccording to the Inception impact assessment document, CBAM alternatives seem to apply only to imports into the EU, for purposes of maintaining competitiveness of the EU-Based industry in the internal market. However, Repsol considers that any CBAM measures should also provide effective carbon leakage protection for the European companies exporting abroad EU so that CBAM will play sideways: imports and exports.  \n\nIn other words, any future measures should be complementary to the existing ETS free allocation system or at equivalent system that effectively would cover – on an integral point of view - carbon leakage risks in a comparable or better manner as the current free allocation system in the EU ETS. \n\nLastly, the concern about the impact on the competitiveness of European-based industries becomes even more crucial at this time due to the adverse economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic specially over the European producer sectors, which makes a transition period recommended in order to adapt business models to the new environment.\n\nRepsol is willing to become an active participant into the next stages of the definition and implementation of a carbon border adjustment mechanism in the European Union.\n",

        "feedback": "The following points referred to the EC Inception Impact Assessment intend to represent a first SNAM contribution to proposal for a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” Directive.\n•\tEuropean economy competitiveness shall continue to be a key goal for EU policy, being strictly linked to employment levels and, in general, to the overall internal wealth. In this perspective, measures aimed at safeguarding the competitiveness of European industries are imperative, especially if directed to offset the effects of an increased cost of production linked to choices aimed at fostering the energy transition towards a low carbon economy.\n\n•\tA mechanism to reduce the risk of carbon leakage as well as EU industries being less competitive due to higher energy costs is therefore deemed as an appropriate measure bringing together also valuable economic and social impacts. Indeed, production activities set up (or relocated) outside Europe only for exploiting lower energy costs for the absence of negative externalities correction mechanisms (e.g. Emission Trading System or other arrangements in the EU framework, such as Energy Taxation Directive) determine a net adverse environmental balance at global level.\n\n•\tEuropean industry is characterised by a top-class energy system for reasons linked to both technological and legislative evolutions. Such a competitive advantage should not be undermined by the introduction of the virtuous legislative provisions envisaged under the new EU Green Deal aimed at safeguarding the environment. In this perspective, a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” could defend EU economy on the one side against delocalisation choices and on the other side from competition against goods produced at lower costs by using more polluting fuels. This would have a double negative effect: on society, for the loss of local employments and skills, and on environment, since the overall pollutants level is not reduced, being GHG emitted elsewhere in the atmosphere.\n\n•\tAdditionally, we share the view that a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” would contribute to the enhancement of the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) diffusion both in and outside Europe. In particular, a well-designed and properly implemented adjustment scheme could prevent obstacles in the development of renewable gases technologies and the whole supply chain needed to support the energy transition (biomethane and hydrogen newly-born European sectors), that could be endangered by distortive/unfavourable competitive conditions.\n\n•\tThe “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” should be also designed to consider the effects of the policy decisions on export goods in order to keep the competitiveness of EU industries at global level. In this respect, if an increase in costs for imported goods produced with more polluting fuels will be put in place,  equally also a “discount” for exported goods have to be envisaged if those products are produced with low carbon and/or renewable sources (such as biomethane, syngas, hydrogen and abated natural gas).\n\n•\tWhen designing the legislative measures establishing the Mechanism, a correct link with EU Emission Trading System and Energy Taxation Directive should be ensured to adequately reflect in the imported products prices the cost of carbon as well as the different taxation levels applied to energy sources according to their environmental and social impacts.\n \n•\tA “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” would allow to gradually overcome the free allowances granting system - introduced also for mitigating the carbon leakage risk – so that the cost of carbon would be correctly reflected in all the economy sectors.\n",

EEX develops, operates and connects secure, liquid and transparent markets for energy and commodity products. At EEX, contracts on power, emission allowances as well as freight and agricultural products are traded or registered for clearing. EEX is part of Group Deutsche Borse.\nEEX is involved in the EU ETS through its appointment as the Common Auction Platform for 25 EU Member States, as well as, the Opt-out Platform for Germany and conducting auctions for Poland, and as a secondary trading platform for emission allowances. Beyond Europe, EEX is actively supporting emissions market developments in China in collaboration with local partners. In North America, EEX Group’s Nodal Exchange, in cooperation with IncubEx, develops and offers a wide range of environmental products for the North American market including trading in California and RGGI carbon allowances. From this perspective, EEX takes a global perspective on carbon pricing. EEX is a strong advocate and active supporter of increased cooperation and mutual learning between different emissions trading systems as a key policy tool to achieve global emissions reduction targets.\nEEX strongly supports the European Green Deal\nEEX welcomes the Green Deal initiative as a pivotal step for Europe to achieve its ambitious 2030 and 2050 climate targets and assert its role as global climate action leader. Energy markets, and in particular power and emissions markets, will be a key instrument in delivering on Europe’s long-term climate ambitions.\nEuropean energy and emissions markets cannot be considered in isolation, especially when it comes to decarbonisation. Europe is one of the world’s largest energy net importers as well as an important centre of industrial production and final consumption. Europe’s action will have a significant influence on decarbonisation at the global stage.\nThe global expansion of carbon pricing offers significant potential for cooperation\nEEX agrees on the need to address possible carbon leakage from the European Union, as well as supporting European business competing in the global market by creating a level playing field across different national jurisdictions. At the same time, both the existing carbon leakage provisions as well as any new mechanism should take into account global climate policy developments. Over the last few years, we have seen a rapid increase in carbon pricing globally, in particular in form of emissions trading schemes. There are now 21 systems covering 29 jurisdictions with an ETS in force. While significant differences in policy exist globally, the global policy landscape is gradually moving closer towards the vision of global carbon pricing. This also offers significant potential for cooperation between different trading schemes, for instance in the form of linking. Encouraging such global cooperation needs to be a core priority for all stakeholders as pricing carbon globally is the most efficient remedy against carbon leakage.\nPage 1\n© EEX AG - part of eex group\nee\nWith the Green Deal, Europe is setting out to intensify its efforts in global climate diplomacy. We welcome this course as it can make a significant contribution to both increasing global climate action efforts and aligning them, thereby facilitating cooperation. Introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism, if well designed, can be one element in a suite of different policy initiatives and actions contributing to this. It must complemented by other elements, such as leading by example, intensifying outreach to global partners and supporting them in implementing climate policy.\nParticular attention in the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism should be paid to minimizing the risk of global trade disruptions. Such disruption could emerge from the mechanism itself, but also from retaliation measures by non-EU countries in reaction to the mechanism. It should be designed to comply with World Trade Organization rules and other international obligations of the EU. A carbon border adjustment mechanism should first focus on specific pilot sectors, to test the effectiveness of different policy configurations, and ensure the possibility to pivot towards other solutions leading to better results. This is particularly relevant given the high complexity of measuring the carbon content of imports.\nThe Roadmap for a Directive on a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism names several requirements for such policy. It is expected to ensure that the “price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content”. It also states that “the complementarity of the measure with internal carbon pricing, in particular the EU ETS, will also have to be assessed, as well as how it relates to the current measures to avoid the risk of carbon leakage. [...] The measure should be commensurate with the internal EU carbon price. Against the background of these policy objectives, EEX sees the following key principles for the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism should it be implemented:\nKey principles for a carbon border adjustment mechanism\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism should be as closely as possible integrated with the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

Importers would be required to surrender EU Emission Allowances for goods which they import to the EU. This policy approach has several significant advantages over alternatives, such as an import tax/tariff or product standards:\ne An inclusion of imports in the EU ETS would ensure full compatibility with carbon pricing in the EU and the existing energy and climate policy framework. The existing infrastructure of the EU ETS could be used for implementation. The price importers pay would be fully transparent and equal to what EU producers are paying, providing a clear and easily comparable measure for their efforts. They could rely on the liquid and efficient EU emission market to manage their exposure. Inclusion in the EU ETS provides an optimal basis for increasing cooperation between jurisdictions. Other regions would be encouraged to monitor and track emissions in line with the EU ETS, increasing compatibility between different climate policy regimes globally.\nThe introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism for a sector has to be linked to a gradual phase- out of free allocation. The policy objective of such mechanism is to provide an alternative to free allocation and counter some its disadvantages. For reducing administrative complexity, any mechanism should use existing standards, infrastructure and common EU benchmarks already used today for policies to limit carbon leakage.\nPage 2\n© EEX AG - part of eex group\nee\nA decrease in free allocation has to be matched with an increase in the auctioning share. Auctioning is the default allocation method for allowances in the EU ETS. It is the most transparent allocation method, providing a transparent, harmonised and non-discriminatory process. The principle of auctioning, and the objective of gradually moving to full auctioning, is fundamental to the objective of emissions trading as it guarantees costs of carbon are internalized. Auctioning revenues make a significant contribution to climate action in Europe. In 2018, revenues for the EU’s Common Auction Platform alone amounted to more than 14 billion Euros. Member States spent or planned to spend close to 70% of these revenues for specified climate and energy related purposes over the course of the year’.\nContact\nDaniel Wragge Director Political & Regulatory Affairs daniel.wragge@eex.com +49 30 59004 240\nTimo Schulz\nSenior Political & Regulatory Affairs Advisor\ntimo.schulz@eex.com\n+49 30 59004 243\nTransparency Register ID 09579576238-53\n1 Report the functioning of the European carbon market, COM/2019/557 final/2 on\nPage 3\n© EEX AG - part of eex group"

This summary is expanded upon in Ember’s attached report; and ClientEarth’s and Ember’s joint attached briefing, both of which form part of our submission.\nScope of the CBAM \n\nThe main objective of the CBAM is to fight climate change by tackling carbon leakage. The measure will be more effective if it captures leakage of GHGs such as methane. Therefore, we suggest replacing the term “carbon” with a broader term such as “emissions” or “GHG”. \n\nExisting and new methodologies should evolve where possible to capture GHGs. The CBAM should seek ways to overcome administrative burden and include measures that guarantee “ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries” per the roadmap.  \n\nThe CBAM should be assessed:\n•\tAs an alternative to the measures in the ETS that aim to address carbon leakage. Hence, it may nullify the need free allowances and indirect cost compensation if designed so as to ensure a level playing field between EU industries and their non-EU counterparts in relation to the price of carbon-intensive goods imported to the EU. \n•\tTo ensure compatibility with the Energy Taxation Directive under revision. \n•\tIn light of the New Industrial Strategy for Europe and the announced White Paper on an Instrument on Foreign Subsidies, as well as the update of the Industrial Emissions Directive.\n\nA CBAM can be compatible with WTO rules, for example Article II.2 or Article III.2 of the GATT. In any case, the CBAM could be justified under Article XX of the GATT exemption, and more specifically for the reasons described in paragraphs b (allowing measures for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health) and/or g (allowing measures for the conservation of exhaustible natural resources). As the CBAM objective is to combat climate change rather than to favour EU domestic products and services over foreign ones, it can be designed in a way not to constitute an arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.\n\nApplication\nThe measure should apply in the following areas of the energy sector: \n•\tTrade of electricity through interconnectors\nElectricity imported to the EU from non-EU countries through interconnectors is not subject to carbon pricing, and is often sourced from carbon-intensive power plants (e.g. Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Turkey, Morocco, Ukraine). Research by Ember shows that carbon leakage in electricity is already occurring, and a CBAM could be the only effective way to avoid this leakage. \n•\tFossil fuel imports to the EU\nThe EU’s importing of coal, fossil gas, LNG and oil involves significant risk of leakage given the emissions intensity of extracting, processing, storing and transporting those materials. Such emissions may not be properly accounted for due to lack of adequate legal climate frameworks, and so could cause GHG leakage.  The Commission should ensure the CBAM properly accounts for the emissions involved in these imports.\n\nForm\nThe roadmap and Ember in its report suggest several options for the mechanism. The choice of the most suitable and effective form should be based on compatibility with WTO rules, timing of the mechanism, adaptability and effectiveness. \n\nLegal basis and instrument\nAs the main purpose of the measure is to combat climate change, Article 192 of the TFEU seems to provide a more suitable legal basis than Article 207. To safeguard a higher level of harmonisation and coordination in a complex area, a regulation is preferred over a directive.\n\nFinal remarks\nThe CBAM will link to various areas of EU policy and legislation. We strongly recommend the CBAM is adopted through a transparent, close and meaningful cooperation with DG TAXUD with DGs CLIMA, TRADE, ENER,  COMP and ENV.     \nFinally, ClientEarth and Ember should be included in the specialised audience, which will participate in the more technical consultation.\nClie",
        "pdf_text": "ClientEarth and Ember joint feedback on the Roadmap for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)\nApplications in the energy sector\nWe welcome the European Commission’s proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM or ‘mechanism’) envisaged in the European Green Deal as a means to achieve the EU’s ambition of reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 50-55% by 2030. According to the Roadmap Impact Assessment for the CBAM (Roadmap), the mechanism should apply to sectors with the greatest levels of leakage. As such, this document highlights the need for immediate action to address emissions leakage caused by current policy, specifically in the energy sector.\nOutlined below are considerations and recommendations relating to the objective of the mechanism, its consistency with relevant law and policy, methodological issues, scope and legal form.\nObjective\nThe Roadmap notes the EU’s GHG reduction efforts could be negated by the lower climate ambition of non-EU trading partners, and that the CBAM could address this risk by avoiding carbon leakage. However, in order to genuinely reflect the EU’s climate ambition, the term “carbon leakage” should be broadened beyond referring only to carbon dioxide; it should incorporate leakage of other GHG emissions such as methane. This approach would make the CBAM consistent with other EU tools and policies contributing to the EU Paris Agreement commitments, such as the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), the Effort Sharing Regulation, and the New Industrial Strategy for Europe (Industrial Strategy).* Therefore, we suggest the term “carbon”’ in the CBAM should be replaced with a broader term capturing all greenhouse gases, such as “emissions” or “GHGs”.\nConsistency with EU law and policy\nThe relevant EU legal frameworks and policies dealing with GHG liability must be consistent. As recalled in the Roadmap, the European Green Deal envisages a CBAM “for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage”. The CBAM is considered an alternative to the measures in the ETS that aim to mitigate carbon leakage from certain sectors, such as the allocation of free allowances and compensation for indirect costs passed onto electro-intensive industries.\nThe CBAM may therefore nullify the need for ETS-related State aid; this is particularly clear for the allocation of free allowances. In this respect, the draft ETS State aid Guidelines provide that “[t]he Commission may decide to review or adapt these Guidelines at any time if this should be necessary for reasons associated with competition policy or in order to take account of other Union policies or international commitments.”? The implementation of the CBAM could be one such relevant policy.’ The purpose of the aid measures would indeed disappear if a CBAM were designed in such a manner as to ensure a level playing field between EU industries and their non-EU counterparts which export carbon-intensive goods to the EU.*\n1 Commission’s communication of 10 March 2020, COM(2020) 102 final:\nhttps ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-eu-industrial-strate -march-2020 en.pdf\n? https://ec.europa.eu/competition/consultations/2020 ets stateaid guidelines/consultance report.pdf at\npara. 67.\n3 See Annex 1 of the draft ETS State aid guidelines submitted to public consultation between 14 January and 10 March 2020:\nhttps ec.europa.eu/competition/consultations/2020 ets stateaid uidelines/draft_ets uidelines_en.pdf\n4 The stakeholders’ submissions to the public consultation not published the Commission’s website yet. are on See e.g. ClientEarth’s observations on the draft ETS State aid guidelines:\nIn relation to the ETD, we consider that the CBAM would not affect the need to revise this Directive in order to bring it in line with the 2030 energy targets and climate neutrality by 2050.° While both the CBAM and a reform of energy taxation can increase the price of GHGs and contribute to climate objectives, these tools have different geographical and material scopes, and are complementary. Therefore, we recommend that the two files be conducted in parallel and made compatible with one another.\nThe need for and scope of the CBAM should also be assessed in light of the Industrial Strategy. The CBAM should be implemented as a safeguard measure for EU industry, not a permanent remedy. Differences in ambition between the EU and third countries will likely persist in 2021, which is the deadline set by the Commission to introduce the CBAM. There will probably therefore be a genuine need for the CBAM. Nevertheless, EU industry must not be able to exploit the CBAM to reduce its duties to rapidly decarbonise, become energy efficient and invest in the technologies to enable this. Likewise, the CBAM should not undermine the ambition of the EU to support industrial evolution as per its industrial policy commitments.\nThe Commission is currently seeking feedback on its roadmap® for an update of the Industrial Emissions Directive (‘IED’). That roadmap proposes exploring the inclusion of decarbonisation of industry within the scope of the IED, which applies to large combustion plants, amongst over 50,000 industrial installations. As pressure increases on EU installations to decarbonise, it is essential that decarbonisation is also encouraged amongst industrial operators exporting to the EU, including via a CBAM\nA final point in relation to consistency with EU law and policy is that the CBAM’s rates and methodologies should adapt to variations in subsidies given to non-EU industries that are exporting carbon-intensive goods to the EU. This could be linked to the announced White Paper on an Instrument on Foreign Subsidies, which will address distortive effects caused by foreign subsidies within the single market.\nConsistency with WTO rules\nThe Roadmap notes the feasibility of the mechanism will need to be assessed against WTO rules. Our conclusion is that the CBAM could be consistent with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provisions and be taken for example on the basis of Article II.2 or Article III.2 of the GATT. A detailed analysis of these options goes beyond the scope of the present document.\nIn any case, the CBAM could be justified under Article XX of the GATT exemption, and more specifically for the reasons described in paragraphs b (allowing measures for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health) and/or g (allowing measures for the conservation of exhaustible natural resources). As the CBAM objective is to combat climate change rather than favour EU domestic products and services over foreign ones, it can be designed in a way not to constitute an arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, (which are prohibited under WTO law).\nTo strengthen the justification under the WTO rules, we suggest the following features in the CBAM design:\nhttps www.documents.clientearth.or, library/download-info/clientearths-response-to-the-consultation-on- the-draft-ets-state-aid-guidelines/\n5 Roadmap and consultation the ETD : https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your- on say/initiatives/12227-Revision-of-the-Energy-Tax-Directive-\n5 Roadmap and consultation the IED: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your- on say/initiatives/12306-EU-rules-on-industrial-emissions-revision\nMaintain a high level of transparency and consistently emphasise the climate-related purpose of the mechanism throughout the drafting process and adoption, application, monitoring and reporting of the measure once in place; Seek a negotiated but principled solution with affected countries; Provide importers the opportunity to prove their own emissions; Avoid entrenchment by prescribing an expiration date that can be extended to prevent further leakage if warranted; Use any revenues generated from the CBAM to promote decarbonisation and climate policies in third countries;’ Use Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) alone or with Article 207 TFEU as the legal basis for the measure.\nMethodology\nMethodological considerations relating to the energy sector are set out below:\ne Existing and new methodologies should evolve where possible to capture greenhouse gas emissions in the whole production and value chain at upstream, midstream and downstream level including, for example, emissions from transportation and extraction that are not otherwise captured. We understand that the Roadmap favours reducing administrative burden overall but recognises that “ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries may be needed”. We recommend that the CBAM seek ways to address administrative burden rather than compromising the effective assessment of emissions intensity. For example, for electricity imports, the methodology used to estimate the emissions intensity will be a crucial design choice for both the effectiveness and legality of the measure. Carbon intensity varies enormously by country and by hour. Tracking these variations would make an effective policy, but country-specific treatment may contravene the non-discrimination rules of the WTO (for example, GATT Article |). A compromise could be to use technology benchmarks, combined with detailed generation data and other relevant information already at hand such as market data on international exchanges. Regardless, the relatively simple value chain of electricity production should minimise administrative burden.\nCBAM in the energy sector\nWe recommend that the mechanism apply to the following areas of the energy sector.\n1. Trade of electricity through interconnectors\nInterconnectors are considered a key component of the clean energy transition as they enable better integration of renewables and fairer prices for consumers. However, the EU has interconnections with multiple neighbouring non-EU countries that produce carbon-intensive electricity. Electricity from these countries is not subject to carbon pricing, and is often sourced from power plants that do not comply with environmental standards commensurate with the EU (e.g. Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Turkey, Morocco, Ukraine).\nResearch by Ember shows that carbon leakage in electricity is already occurring, and could increase with growing disparity in climate ambition between the EU and neighbouring states as the level of interconnection increases.® As it is not possible to know the origin of electrons at their point of\n7 See for example https: ost.eu/eu-green-deal-meeting-targets- by-lowerin eu-neighbour- ener -non- emissions-too/.\n8 Chris Rosslowe, ‘The path of least how electricity generated from coal leaking the EU’ Dr resistance: is into Sandbag (January 2020), available at https://ember-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-SB-Path- of-least-resistance-1.2b DIGI.pdf.\nconsumption, a CBAM on electricity imports is the only effective way to avoid this leakage. A CBAM on electricity would have the added benefits of incentivising clean electricity in other countries and improving cross-border health benefits. However, precautions would need to be taken to ensure EU Member States do not abuse such a mechanism to restrict the application of Article 16(8) of Electricity Market Regulation? , which prescribe an obligation for Member States to increase the use of interconnection capacity, and thus electricity trade, by at least 70%\n2 Fossil fuel imports to the EU\nWhere the EU imports coal, fossil gas, LNG or oil, there is significant risk that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction, processing, storage, and transportation of those fossil fuels may not be properly accounted for and so cause GHG leakage.\nEvidence now shows that emissions from extraction, processing and transporting fossil gas, LNG and oil is extremely greenhouse gas intensive. Methane can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as carbon dioxide over a 20 year period. A recent study showed that anthropogenic methane emissions, mainly from the oil and gas sector, have been underestimated by up to 40%.”° The processing and transport of LNG further increases greenhouse damage due to the level of methane leakage - Robert Howarth of Cornell University estimates that shale gas LNG imported to Ireland would have a greenhouse gas footprint at least 44% higher than that of coa |.24\nIn terms of coal, EU producers may be subject to stricter regulation and therefore higher carbon liability than neighbouring export countries. For example, methane emissions from mining are accounted for through the Effort Sharing Regulation 2018/842, meaning that coal production emissions would be covered by the EU's broad climate target. The CBAM could therefore level the playing field between coal producers in the EU and those from neighbouring countries in terms of such regulation and carbon liability.\nAs the EU develops infrastructure for increased importation of fossil gas, LNG and oil, and continues to import coal from countries such as Russia, stopping GHG border leakage will be critical. In order to avoid perverse incentives for the use of imported fossil fuels, the Commission, as part of its announced methane strategy, should ensure the CBAM properly accounts for the emissions involved in these imports.\nCBAM form\nThe Roadmap outlines three options for the form of the CBAM. The choice of form should take into account the following criteria.\nCompatibility with WTO rules: Extension of existing schemes, which apply to producers based within the EU, would have better prospects of passing the WTO test. Implementing the CBAM in this way would help show that the measures do not introduce discrimination against imported products. For example, the areas discussed in this submission could be regulated through changes to the ETS or the ETD. Timing: The review of related EU legislation such as the ETS and the ETD offer an opportunity to adopt the complementary CBAM by 2021;\n° Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 the internal on market for electricity\n10 Benjamin Hmiel et al, ‘Preindustrial 14CH4 indicates greater anthropogenic fossil CH4 emissions’ Nature (20\nFebruary 2020) Vol 578.\n1 Testimony of Robert W. Howarth, Ph.D. Cornell University before the Joint Committee Climate Action on House of Oireachtas, Ireland 9 October 2019.\n3. Adaptability: The selected form should be amenable to quick adjustment as a response to the increase of climate ambition in non-EU countries; 4 Effectiveness: An effective mechanism should: a Minimise risk of carbon price gaming; b Prevent resource shuffling, whereby exporters reduce their climate obligation by substituting electricity with lower carbon intensity, while exporting high-carbon electricity with other trade partners; Prevent bypass and semi-finished goods, whereby carbon related taxes may be avoided by producing and exporting semi-finished goods.’\nRevenues\nAs mentioned above, CBAM revenues should be used in a similar way to the ETS: to promote EU climate and energy policies, and support decarbonisation efforts and climate policies in third countries. Emphasis should be on the latter, given the Green Deal envisages the EU taking a leading role in the climate change fight. In addition, to mitigate possible negative social impacts, the Commission should consider distributing CBAM revenues to any vulnerable customers affected by price increases (in electricity or other goods) , as well as to support just transition initiatives in those areas, where local economies might be particularly impacted by rising costs of energy.\nLegal basis and instrument\nAs the main purpose of the measure is to combat climate change, Article 192 of the TFEU seems to provide a more suitable legal basis alone or together with Article 207 of the TFEU. To safeguard a higher level of harmonisation and coordination in a complex area, a regulation would be preferred over a directive.\nFinal remarks\nThe CBAM will interact with multiple areas of EU policy and legislation. We strongly recommend the measure be adopted following transparent, close and meaningful cooperation with DG TAXUD with DGs CLIMA, TRADE, ENER, COMP and ENV.\nIn addition to the general public consultation, ClientEarth and Ember request that we be included in the specialised audience to participate in the technical consultation.\n?For more detail on the above criteria on effectiveness please see Adam Whitmore, ”The ABC of BCAs: An overview of the issues around introducing Border Carbon Adjustments in the EU”, Sandbag (December 2019), available at https://ember-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-SB-Border-Adjustments DIGI-1.pdf\n5\nE PATH OF\nLEAST RESISTAN\nHow electricity generated from coal i eaking into the E\nWeal Sp\nVia GS!)\nww ip Vi NN\nLS, mK\nhis SS YW\nSs aN ty\nZ\n4\nI\nIp\neS QZ |\n“ol\nWY, lg)\nmi LE\nRD V4 ra ) RK\n=H ii Sz > As\nL i<\n(\ni\n«| A\nA a\nig\n<i\nFi (Baas %, S|\n— Ui ae NE\n= r Ibe ca mais A >\n[is\nSS\nge\nBZ\nvA aa\nDA | /\ni\" Ni\nNS\nr\\ Be v_IN au’\na=\n— 3 SS\n= TPs\nrx PS\na\nsandba 9g\nsmarter climate policy\ny\nMog\nA\na\nsandba g\nsmarter climate policy\nPublished in January 2020 by Sandbag.

We reveal that countries covered by the EU carbon price are increasingly importing electricity, and many new links are planned. Allowing this carbon leakage to continue will undermine EU emissions cuts, as well as incentivising further use of coal in neighbouring countries, turning them into ‘offshore carbon havens’.\nThe solution is to apply a carbon price on electricity imports - also Known as a border carbon adjustment (BCA). Applying a BCA for electricity is easier than for other internationally traded products (i.e. steel or cement), as flows of electricity are transparent, and the relatively simple production chain allows tracing of carbon emissions. Without ETS free-allocation, administration is easier, and trade politics are far simpler. A border carbon adjustment on electricity would not only restore the integrity of EU climate policy, but also incentivise low-carbon electricity generation in neighbouring states, and the spread of carbon pricing.\nThis report analyses:\ne How much CO2 leakage is there from electricity today? What growth in imports should we expect? Could a carbon border adjustment on electricity work to reduce carbon leakage?\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nKey findings\nCountries in the EU ETS are increasingly importing electricity. Net imports were up from 3TWh in 2017 to 21TWh in 2019. All the imports are from countries that have zero or near-zero carbon pricing. Imported electricity emitted an estimated 26 million tonnes of CO2 - more than the annual emissions of Italy’s coal fleet. Generating the same volume of electricity in the importing EU member states would have emitted 11 million tonnes less, as their power grids are lower carbon on average. Gross electricity imports in 2019 were worth €1.6bn. Had they paid the EU ETS carbon price, this would have generated revenue of €630m. Plans exist to increase interconnection capacity between EU and non- EU countries by 31%, further exposing EU power markets to imports. 15% of this expansion is with the Western Balkans, home to Europe’s most polluting power stations. New coal power (up to 57GW) is being planned or constructed in countries connected, or soon to be connected to EU power grids. This would mean a 53% increase in coal capacity in connected countries as a whole. Most is planned in Turkey (34GW), Egypt (11GW), Bosnia & Herzegovina (4GW), and Serbia (2GW). By 2025, five additional non-EU countries - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Israel, and Moldova - could be connected with EU member states. None of these have a carbon price.\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nWhich EU member states are most exposed?\nOf the 13 EU countries connected to a non-EU neighbour, some are particularly exposed to coal power imports. This is because they have ample interconnection with neighbours operating (or planning) large coal fleets, while themselves pursuing more ambitious decarbonisation. The key countries at risk are:\ne Greece, which will phase out coal by 2028, but is connected to Europe's largest coal developer Turkey, and plans to connect with the fossil fuel- heavy grid of Egypt. Finland, the largest importer of electricity in the EU - all from the fossil- heavy Russian grid. Spain, where domestic coal generation is collapsing, but imports of coal power from Morocco are rising, and more interconnection is planned. Croatia, which has proposed high renewable electricity targets for 2030, but is heavily integrated with the grid of Bosnia & Herzegovina, which is actively developing coal. Romania, which has the third highest interconnection capacity with non- EU neighbours, is expanding interconnection with Ukraine, and planning new connections with coal-powered Turkey and Moldova. Hungary, which intends to move beyond domestic fossil generation almost entirely by 2030, yet is the largest EU importer of carbon intensive electricity from Ukraine.\nPolicy recommendation\nWe propose a border carbon adjustment (BCA) on gross electricity imports into the EU ETS region. This would defend the integrity of EU climate policy by preventing offshoring of power sector emissions. It would also create an incentive for neighbouring states to decarbonise and/or align climate policies, accelerating the spread of carbon pricing. We offer some design recommendations, to reduce carbon leakage effectively, mitigate unintended consequences, and minimise the risk of legal challenge.\nNew European Commission President von der Leyen has put forward border carbon adjustments as part of a green deal for Europe. We believe the power sector is the best place to start implementing such a policy.\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nContents\nExecutive summary\nHow much carbon is leaking into the EU?\nElectricity flows Carbon emissions from traded electricity\nWhat changes in imports can we expect?\nA Border Carbon Adjustment on Electricity\nOverview Turkey — Greece & Bulgaria Morocco «+ Spain & Portugal Ukraine < Hungary / Romania / Poland / Slovakia Western Balkans « Greece / Croatia / Hungary / Romania / Bulgaria Egypt « Cyprus & Greece\n13\n13\n18\n20\n22\n25\n27\n20\nReferences\nAnnex 1: Annual electricity trade data\n55\n56\nHow much-carbon is:leaking int Qs.\nthe EU2/\n%\nInterconnectors are undoubtedly effective at lowering electricity costs and reducing curtailment of renewables. However, a disparity in carbon pricing at the border of the EU is creating a competitive advantage for high-carbon generators in neighbouring countries. In this section we analyse the effect this is having on electricity imports and associated carbon emissions.\nElectricity flows\nThe trade flows considered in this analysis are between the block of countries participating in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS, i.e., EU member states plus Norway and Switzerland), and any neighbouring country not in this block. In total, 13 EU countries are physically connected with 11 non-EU countries.\nThe ENTSO-E Transparency Platform’ pubishes hourly flows of electricity between these countries”. We cross-checked this dataset against the ENTSO-E’s Grid Map? of Europe, and found hourly exchange data exists for all relevant interconnections, except Morocco to Spain, for which we retrieved equivalent data through the Red Eléctrica de Espafia eSIOS platform’.\nThe EU ETS region is a net importer of electricity. Figure 1 shows that every year since 2015, the EU ETS region has imported 3-21TWh more than it has exported. The highest gross and net imports have come in the last two years, simultaneous with the increase in the EU ETS carbon price. The net import in 2019 was 21TWh, or 0.6% of EU electricity demand (3256TWh in 20165). Annual figures are provided in Table 1.\n1. ENTSO-E Transparency platform.\n2.

Note: Imports from Russia to Lithuania all originate from the Kaliningrad enclave.\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nIn Figure 2 we show gross imports in 2019 by origin and destination. A total of 33TWh was imported. The majority (79%) originated from just three regions: Russia (38%), Ukraine (22%), and the Western Balkans (19%). Imports were received mostly by 4 EU countries: Finland (23%), Lithuania (17%), Greece (17%), and Hungary (13%).\nOnly 12.6TWh was exported in 2019 (Figure 1). The biggest exporting member states by far were Bulgaria (40%) and Slovakia (23%).\nTaking into account both imports and exports, the EU ETS countries with the largest net imports were Finland (8TWh), Lithuania (S5TWh), Greece (5TWh), and Hungary (4TWh). Trade with the Western Balkans was high in both directions, with 6.3TWh imported and 6.9TWh exported by the EU. Annex 1 contains full data for country-country exchanges in 2019, and the full multi-year dataset can be explored on our website.\nIn Figure 3, we show how exchanges with individual neighbouring countries have changed over time. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Bosnia & Herzegovina have been consistent exporters to the EU since 2015. Morocco became a net exporter to Spain for the first time in 2019. Gross imports from Morocco to the Iberian peninsula grew from almost nothing in 2018 (0.18TWh) to 1.2TWh in 2019.\nThe average ETS carbon price rose from approximately €6 in 2017 to €16 and €25 in 2018 and 2019 respectively. This is a cost that EU generators face, but electricity imports do not. We find that between 2017 and 2018, net imports increased from 8 out of 9 non-EU countries (Turkey being the only to decrease).\nAs well as volume, ENTSO-E publishes the hourly price of electricity in each EU country. We multiplied the hourly price by the hourly import flows to calculate the value of electricity imports in every country. We found that the total value of gross imports in 2019 was €1.6bn. Despite having the third largest imports by volume, Greece was the largest EU importer by value, importing €366m in 2019, up from €259m and €338m in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In terms of origin, €549m was purchased from Russia, €370m from Ukraine, €363m from the Western Balkans.\nThis means that in 2019, 33TWh of electricity worth €1.6bn was imported into the EU ETS region, having been generated in an effective carbon price haven.\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\n\nEU electricity imports from neighbouring countries\nAlbania\nBelarus\n1500\n1000\n500\n0)\n500\nBosnia & Herzegovina\nMorocco\nNorth Macedonia\nRussia\n1500\n1000\n500\n0 Sat ere\n500\nSerbia\nTurkey\nUkraine\n1500\n1000\n500 7h ryt ee\nmae,\nMarne.\n0\n500\nx\n©\nRy\n©\n%\nS\n©\n%\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nN\nVv\nN\nS\nN\nS\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nNet monthly imports to all EU member states from different non-EU countries, for the period January 2015 to December 2019 inclusive.\n\nAnnual electricity trade, and associated carbon emissions, between countries in the EU ETS and connected neighbours.\nYear\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nImport\n26.8\n29.0\n25.9\n36.1\n33.3\nElectricity\nExport\n23.8\n20.8\n22.8\n16.8\n12.6\n( TWh) a\nImport\n21.5\n23.2\n20.3\n29.2\n25.6\nCarbon\nExport\n12.0\n10.2\n10.9\n8.5\n6.0\n(MtCO2)\nNet\n9.5\n13.0\n9.4\n20.7\n19.6\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nCarbon emissions from traded electricity\nOf the 11 connected non-EU countries, only Ukraine has any form of carbon pricing applying to electricity generation (currently set at €0.31/tCO2). In comparison, electricity generators in the EU ETS must surrender allowances to cover their carbon emissions, which in 2019 cost approximately €25/tCO2. In this section, we ask: how much unpriced COQ2 is being emitted in connected countries to satisfy the demand of EU imports?\nThere is sufficient open data to quantify volume and value of electricity trade, but estimating the resulting carbon emissions is more difficult. It requires knowledge of the carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh) of electricity flowing through each interconnector. Such an estimate is not straightforward, because the electricity is rarely traceable to a specific power plant, and even if it were, the carbon intensity of an individual power plant is not easily available. The best approximation would use the carbon intensity of the marginal generating unit at the time of export. However, despite recent efforts [1], this remains a challenging calculation, beyond the scope of this report.\nWe followed a simplified approach, estimating the average carbon intensity of the exporting country’s electricity supply. For this calculation®’ we took the annual CO2 emissions from each country’s power sector (EDGAR? v5, data for 2018), and divided this by total annual electricity generation (IEA). While sufficient for this analysis, this method could be improved upon in several ways. For example, an hourly estimate could be achieved by combining the hourly flow data with the hourly generation mix in each exporting country. Combining this with an assumed carbon intensity for each generating technology would then provide an hourly average carbon intensity of electricity generation. ENTSO-E publishes such hourly generation data for some, but not all countries considered in this analysis.\n6. All Imports into Lithuania are from the Kaliningrad enclave, which has a different generation mix to Russia as a whole. The largest power stations in Kaliningrad are the gas-fired Kaliningradskaya (QOOMW) and Pregolskaya (455MW). We therefore adopted an assumed carbon intensity for gas power stations of 500gCO2/kWh [2].\n7. We took a slightly different approach to Ukraine, due to its segregated grid structure. Hungary and Slovakia are connected to the ‘Burshtyn island’, a section of grid disconnected from the rest of Ukraine since 2002, operating synchronously with its ENTSO-E neighbours, and dominated by the Burshtyn (2.3GW) coal plant. Similarly, the connection with Poland is specifically with the Dobrotvirska (510MW) coal plant. For exports through these connections we use carbon intensities of these individual plants taken from the literature [3].\n8.

We find that out of the 21 cross-border interconnectors, 17 serve to connect an EU grid to a higher carbon intensity non-EU grid, with just 4 doing the opposite. Moreover, 8 of the 10 connections carrying the largest gross imports into the EU do so from a higher-carbon grid.\nGiven the EU ETS region is a net importer of electricity, and connected grids are predominantly higher carbon intensity, it follows that it is also a net importer of carbon. We estimate that in 2019, the EU ETS region imported 26MtCO2 while exporting 6MtCO2, i.e., a net import of 2OMtCO2. This net import of CO2 has doubled since 2017. Approximatley 35% of gross CO2 imported in 2019 originated from Russia, followed by 27% from Ukraine and 20% from the Western Balkans.\nx\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nCountries in the EU ETS collectively imported 26MtCO2 in 2019 (20MtCO2 net), equivalent to the annual emissions of the Italian coal fleet’®.\nIt's clear that significant and increasing amounts of high-carbon electricity is entering the EU via a number of routes. These dynamics are highly suggestive of carbon leakage in the EU ETS. What’s driving this leakage? More detailed modelling of connected grids would be required to answer definitively. However, it can only be encouraged by the sharp disparity in the price of carbon at the border of the EU, combined with ample interconnection providing generators on either side access to the same markets. This view is supported by the observed increase in net imports in 2018 and 2019, simultaneous with the increase in EU ETS carbon price.\nIf gross electricity imports had been subject to the EU ETS carbon price on a real-time basis in 2019, additional costs would have totalled €630m.\nThis works out as an average of €19/MWh (€630m/33TWh). This is indicative of the cost advantage enjoyed by generators in the EU’s 13 neighbouring countries, which will be higher for high-carbon generators such as coal power plants. The avoided carbon costs of €630m are not insignificant compared to total ETS auction revenues, which were €14bn in 2018\".\nElectricity used in EU countries, but generated outside of the EU ETS, avoided €630m of carbon costs in 2019.\nAllowing this to continue risks undermining decarbonisation objectives in the affected EU states, and beyond. As EU member states attempt to decarbonise their power sectors, interconnectors tapping in to cheap, high-carbon electricity risks emissions being exported rather than genuinely reduced. The EU's target to increase interconnection between member states to 15% by 2030 could expose more member states - beyond those considered here - to the same risks of carbon leakage.\nIn the following section we show that without policy intervention to prevent carbon leakage, divergence in energy policy (i.e., decarbonisation ambition) combined with increases in interconnection, means the problem is only likely to get worse.\n10. Emissions in 2018 were 25.3MtCO2 based on EU ETS data from the European Union Transaction Log, via Europe Beyond Coal.\n11.

A 2018 EU study [4] provides the total interconnection capacity of every EU country with its non-EU neighbours. These capacities are not always fully available for exchange, because in price-coupled areas such as those encompassed by ENTSO-E, capacity for (day-ahead) trade is allocated based on the optimum market solution. However, given the objective of this process is usually to maximise trade between price zones, to even prices, the physical capacity should be a reasonable approximation of what is made available. We compared these total connection capacities to the total physical energy flows observed in 2018, to estimate interconnector utilisation for each non- EU country. Our estimates ranged from 5-41%, with an overall utilisation of 13%. Albania had the highest (the only one above 20%), and Belarus the lowest. On this basis we conclude that spare interconnection capacity exists with every presently connected non-EU country.\n12\nWhat changes in imports can we\nexpect?\nOverview\nIn the previous section we established that high-carbon electricity is leaking into the EU, through interconnections with non-EU states that predominantly generate electricity with a higher carbon intensity. In this section we explore the future of interconnection, and power sector development in connected countries, to assess the future of carbon leakage without policy intervention.\nMore interconnectors are planned. To assess developments in interconnection, we consulted the ENTSO-E Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), the EU Commission list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI), and national energy strategies. In Figure 5 we present a map of all existing and planned interconnectors between EU (ETS) and non-EU countries. We found that by 2030, interconnection capacity between EU and non-EU countries is planned to increase by 31%. This expansion will connect 2 additional EU ETS countries (Cyprus, Portugal) and 5 additional non-EU countries (Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Moldova’). In Figure 6 we summarise the increases that are planned between 14 pairs of countries. It can be seen that 10 out of 14 of these pairs involve a non- EU country with higher carbon intensity electricity than its EU counterpart. Figure 7 and Table 2 provide a full breakdown of current and future interconnection capacity with each neighbouring country.\nMore coal plants are also planned, in countries connected or soon-to-be connected to the EU. Using data from Global Energy Monitor on coal power development (July 2019) [5], we found that connected or soon-to-be connected countries are collectively planning 57GW of new coal capacity’. The largest developers are Egypt, Turkey, Serbia, and Bosnia & Herzegovina. A full breakdown by country is given in Figure 7, and values can be found in Table 2.\n12. Power lines already connect Romania and Moldova, but these are not in operation. A project to restore the connection to 600MW was identified as a Project of Mutual Interest in 2016 in the framework of Energy Community.\n13.

We assessed power sector developments in connected countries, using draft National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs, EU) or Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs, non-EU), as well as national strategy documents. We found that some of the largest importers of electricity, such as Finland, Greece, and Croatia, also have the most ambitious power decarbonisation plans. Six EU countries: Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, and Finland, have committed to phasing-out coal power domestically before 2030, but will remain exposed to non-EU coal power imports after this date without policy intervention. In general, decarbonisation progress in EU countries risks being undermined if imports of coal electricity continue to have a competitive advantage. Climate goals will be thwarted if emissions are exported rather than genuinely saved.\nFrom here, we focus our analysis on five regions that strongly exhibit the problems outlined above:\ne Turkey < Greece / Bulgaria Morocco <> Spain Ukraine < Poland / Slovakia / Hungary / Romania Western Balkans <> Croatia / Hungary / Romania / Bulgaria / Greece Egypt <> Greece\nWe do not provide further analysis on Russia or Belarus, despite both being major sources of electricity imports to the EU. In brief, the Baltic states - importers of Russian and Belarusian electricity - are seeking to reduce their reliance on these imports, instead pursuing projects to synchronise their networks with the EU grid by 2025. The other major recipient of Russian electricity is Finland, which has no plans to increase interconnection capacity with Russia. The increase in imports is partly caused by the delays in commissioning the Olkiluoto-3 nuclear reactor, which is currently due to connect to the Finnish grid in summer 2020.\n17\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nTurkey <> Greece & Bulgaria\n\nSchematic map of interconnection between Turkey and neighbouring EU member states\n=\nRO\nCapacity (GW)\n@ 1\n@2\n@:;\nCoal plants\nMK\n@\nOperating\n© Planned\ngCO./kWh\n1000\n@ @\n750\n500\nGR\na £\n250\n7\nYD\"\nTR\na\nrN\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation. All cross-border power lines are represented as a single line, with total transfer capacity indicated (GW). Planned connections (dashed) are shown in red. Points indicate operating and planned coal power stations in Turkey (GEM).\nCurrent trade\nTurkey exported 2.8TWh of electricity to its EU neighbours in 2019 (2.7TWh to Greece, 0.1TWh to Bulgaria), worth €177m. Turkey was the 4th largest source of electricity imports to the EU ETS, and Greece the 3rd largest importer. We estimate gross imports from Turkey accounted for 5% of all CO2 from electricity imports. Over the same period, Turkey imported 1.1TWh almost entirely from Bulgaria, making it a net exporter to the EU, and almost a pure exporter to Greece. This is suggestive of a potential flow loop, with Bulgaria exporting to Greece, via Turkey. However, even if this is the case, the majority of Turkish exports to Greece must originate in Turkey.\nEnergy development plans\nUsing data from 2018, we estimate that Turkey has a slightly lower average grid intensity than both Greece and Bulgaria. In its 2012 energy efficiency strategy,\n18\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nTurkey announced a target to reduce the intensity of its electricity by 20% by 2023, however, an 2016 IEA\" review found “no concrete steps taken”. Instead, renewable energy installations have stalled, and a radical increase in coal capacity is planned. According to GEM, an enormous 34GW of coal power is at some stage of planning, adding to 19GW already operational, and placing Turkey third behind only China and India in its intent to add new coal capacity. This has already started, with 7GW permitted or under construction.\nIn contrast, power sector emissions in Greece are declining (approx 40% between 2007-2016), and further decarbonisation plans have been outlined. These include phasing-out all 4GW of coal power by 2028\", and a commitment to increase the share of renewable electricity consumption to 61% by 2030. The latter will require significant investment. The carbon intensity of Bulgaria's electricity will likely fall steadily, with the latest NECP draft’® recommending a 27% share of renewable generation by 2030 (up from 15% in 2017), and no new coal capacity planned.\nFuture of interconnection\nTurkey is connected to neighbouring EU member states with a substantial 4.4GW capacity (1.9GW Greece, 2.5GW Bulgaria). This means that after retiring its own coal fleet, Greece could feasibly import half the same capacity from Turkey. While our research revealed no plans to increase capacity with Greece or Bulgaria, we estimate both existing lines have spare capacity, with both operating at less than 20% of the physical maximum in 2018 (see Box 1). A new 7OOMW sub-sea connection with Romania has been proposed (Figure 8), and was included in Romania’s energy strategy for 2011-2020.\nCarbon pricing in Turkey?\nAn Emissions Trading Scheme is being considered. So far the Government has only adopted legislation for monitoring, reporting and verification (in 2012), with monitoring commencing in 2016 [6].\nSummary\nTurkey is a net electricity exporter to the EU, almost entirely to Greece. We estimate these exports emitted over 1.3 million tonnes CO2 last year. Unlike generators in Greece, Turkish power stations do not face a carbon price, and are unlikely to for several years. The power sectors of Greece and Turkey are quickly\n14.

Sufficient interconnection capacity exists to replace a substantial amount of Greece's retiring coal fleet with coal imports from Turkey, repeating the pattern seen with Spain and Morocco. A border carbon adjustment on electricity would remove the cost advantage for coal generators in Turkey, hence reducing carbon leakage, while protecting investments in renewables in Greece.\nMorocco <> Spain & Portugal\n\nSchematic map of interconnection between Morocco and neighbouring EU member states\nES\n/\n/\nPT\n‘\ngCO,/kWh\nSS\n. 600\nOn4)\n400\nCapacity (GW)\n@:\nMA\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation. The capacity of cross-border power lines is indicated (GW). Planned connections (dashed) are shown in red. Points indicate operating coal power stations in Morocco (GEM).\nCurrent trade\nEurope's only existing connection with North Africa is via subsea cables to Morocco. Until late 2018, these predominantly carried power from Spain to Morocco, however the direction has now reversed. From 2018 to 2019, net imports to Spain increased by 4.2TWh from -3.4TWh to 0.8TWh. Over the same period,\n20\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nSpain reduced domestic coal generation by a much larger 24.6TWh\"’, meaning the interconnector is far from fully compensating for this. However, coal power in Morocco will out-live that in Spain, risking many more years of carbon leakage.\nFuture of interconnection\nTwo subsea cables with a combined 1.4GW connect Spain and Morocco. A memorandum of understanding was signed in February 2019 to build a third, 7OOMW cable, commissioned ‘before 2026. A new 1GW connection between Morocco and Portugal has also been proposed\", with feasibility studies supposedly concluding in 2019, and completion possible before 2030. If delivered, these projects would increase the interconnection capacity between Morocco and the EU by 120%, to 3.1GW by 2030. However, recognising the threat of coal power imports, the energy ministers of both Spain and Portugal have raised concerns about the lack of carbon pricing at the border.\nEnergy development plans\nWe estimate the carbon\nintensity electricity Spain's (using 2017 data). The opening of the 1.4GW Safi coal plant in Morocco in December 2018 has likely increased that gap. How is this likely to develop? Morocco pledges in its INDC to limit total GHG growth to 24-57% between 2010 and 2030, and in the power sector is aiming for 52% renewable electricity by 2030'°. Spain has a head-start, and is set to proceed much faster. Their draft NECP outlines an ambitious target of 74% renewable electricity by 2030, rising to 100% by 2050. Electricity generated in Portugal has a slightly higher carbon intensity than Spain, but still far below Morocco. Portugal also plans to decarbonise swiftly, phasing-out its 2GW remaining coal power by 2023, and growing renewable electricity to 80% by 2030. These renewables in Portugal and Spain will mostly satisfy domestic demand, and are unlikely to export to Morocco due to the correlation with wind and solar there. This means the main function of the interconnector will likely become importing Moroccan coal power in periods of high demand when solar or wind are not producing.\nof Morocco’s\nis twice that of\nSummary\nBetween 2018 and 2019, Spain reduced domestic coal generation by 25TWh, yet increased net imports from Morocco by 4TWh. This is a clear sign of carbon leakage. On average, the imported electricity was twice as carbon intensive as the domestic supply, but no price was paid on these emissions, and carbon pricing is\n17.

The differing speed of decarbonisation in Morocco compared to Spain and Portugal means the carbon intensity gap is likely to grow in the 2020s, and the interconnectors will continue to import coal power. Simultaneously, the proposed expansion of interconnection risks the Iberian becoming more exposed to coal, offsetting GHG emissions saved by domestic power decarbonisation and coal phase-out. A border carbon adjustment would protect against this, and support the deployment of clean alternatives in all three countries.\nUkraine < Hungary / Romania / Poland / Slovakia\n\nSchematic map of interconnection between Ukraine and neighbouring EU member states\nPL\nHU\nRO\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation.

In 2019, Ukraine exported 7.2TWh to these countries, and imported 3.0TWh, making it a net exporter to the EU. Electricity imports from Ukraine accounted for 22% by volume, but 27% in terms of CO2 emissions. As shown in Figure 2, the largest net flow from Ukraine is into Hungary, followed by Romania and Poland, whereas Slovakia provides nearly all flows in the other direction. It’s possible this electricity flowing into Ukraine from Slovakia is in transit to a third country, e.g., Romania, rather than a genuine import by Ukraine, which would make Ukraine an even more significant exporter to the EU.\nFuture of interconnection\nUkraine has the largest interconnection capacity with EU neighbours of any non- EU country (Table 2). A small increase in the interconnection with Slovakia is planned, in the form of a new 400kV line. Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary are connected to the so-called ‘Burshtyn island’, a section of grid disconnected from the rest of Ukraine since 2002, operating synchronously with its ENTSO-E neighbours, and dominated by the Burshtyn (2.3GW) and Kalush (200MW) coal power plants. Romania and Hungary have second connections to the main (eastern) grid of Ukraine. The connection with Poland allows access specifically to Ukraine’s 510MW Dobrotvirska coal power plant, and has only flowed in the direction of Poland (since 2015). This means Ukrainian electricity exports to\nHungary, Poland and Slovakia are almost entirely coal powered.\nEnergy development plans\nUkraine as a whole has a substantial 21.8GW of operational coal capacity, with a further 660MW at the pre-permit stage in the eastern section of its network, connected with Romania and Hungary. In 2017, coal had a 32% share of generation, with the remainder largely from nuclear (55%), hydro (7%), and natural gas (5%) (IEA). However, as explained above, most connections with the EU are with coal-dominated sections of grid. The Burshtyn and Dobrotvirska power stations have emissions factors of 1080 and 1110g/kWh respectively [3], meaning they generate some of the highest carbon electricity in Europe. Given the Burshtyn island represents the first step toward integrating the wider Ukrainian grid with ENTSO-E, the Burshtyn power station is expected to remain operational for the foreseeable future.\n23\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nThe dominant importer of this extremely high-carbon electricity from Ukraine is Hungary. They have announced the phase-out of all 1GW of coal by 2030, and plan to increase the share of renewable electricity to 20% by the same year (from 7% in 2016), eventually moving beyond fossil generation completely. Next is\nRomania, which also generates lower carbon electricity than Ukraine. Slovakia has also announced a coal phase-out, with its remaining 800MW retiring by 2023.\nCarbon pricing in Ukraine?\nIn 2014, the Ukrainian government signed an EU Association Agreement’, obliging them to develop an emissions trading scheme within 2 years of it coming into force, which happened on 1st September 2017. This scheme is yet to materialise. Ukraine does however have a functioning carbon tax, which applies to power generation. As of 1st January 2019, the government agreed to increase the rate from UAH0.41/tCO2 to a still very low UAH10/tCO2 (€0.31/tCO2), and communicated an intention to increase it by UAH5 per year to reach UAH30 (~€1/ tC02) in 20232\".\nSummary\nConnections of Hungary and Poland with Ukraine are being used to import some of Europe’s highest carbon electricity into the EU. The carbon price paid on this electricity at the point of generation is a tiny fraction of what would be paid in neighbouring EU member states. The strong disparity in carbon price at the border with Ukraine is expected to persist, and gap in carbon intensities across these connections is expected to widen. Ukraine continues to operate heavily polluting thermal power plants, while the main importer of this - Hungary - aims to phase-out coal and increase its share of renewable electricity by 2030. The coal phase-out in Slovakia might also cause this trade flow to flip, risking further Carbon leakage.\n20. https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/november/tradoc_155103.pdf 21.

All cross-border power lines are represented as a single line, with total capacity indicated (GW). New connections (dashed) and planned increases are shown in red. Points indicate coal power stations in the Western Balkans (existing and planned, GEM).\nCurrent trade\nThe Western Balkans (WB) exported 6.3 TWh to the EU in 2019, ranking it third - as a group - behind Russia and Ukraine. Over the same period, 6.9TWh was imported from EU neighbours, making WB a net importer overall. The largest flows into the EU occurred across the borders of North Macedonia/Greece (2.7T Wh) and Bosnia & Herzegovina/Croatia (1.6TWh). The largest flows into the WB occurred across the borders of Bulgaria/North Macedonia (1.8TWh), Bulgaria/Serbia (1.3TWh), and Romania/Serbia (1.0TWh).\nSl\n25\nHU\nCOs\n®\nRO\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nDespite being a net importer of electricity by volume, the Western Balkans are a net exporter in terms of CO2 emissions to the EU. We estimate the 6.3TWh supplied to the EU by the WB emitted 5.2MtCO2, or 20% of CO2 from all electricity imports. On the other hand, EU exports to WB emitted 3.6MtCO2. This reflects the large differences in carbon intensity across EU/non-EU borders in this region, with Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina among the most carbon intensive considered in this analysis.\nFuture of interconnection\nThe WB already has a large 13.8GW interconnection capacity with EU neighbours (Table 2). Our research revealed plans for 2GW of new interconnection capacity. This includes additional lines connecting Serbia and Croatia, North Macedonia and Greece, and an eventual upgrade (to 1.2GW) of the recently commissioned 600MW connection between Montenegro and Italy.\nEnergy development plans\nCoal power projects totalling 6.3GW are at some stage of planning in the WB, representing an 86% increase on the 7.3GW already operational. Bosia & Herzegovina accounts for 4.1GW of this planned coal capacity, while their INDC outlines only a modest annual 3% increase in the share of renewable electricity, from around 25% (in 2017, IEA). The remaining planned coal capacity is mostly in Serbia, which has a similar share of renewable electricity to Bosnia & Herzegovina, and has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2030. Macedonia’s GHG emissions increase under all scenarios in their INDC, with no target set for renewable electricity, currently providing ~23% (2017, IEA). It is therefore likely that fossil sources will continue to dominate power generation in these countries until at least 2025. Looking towards countries likely to be importing high-carbon electricity from WB, Greece and Croatia have stated their intentions to increase renewable electricity to 61% and 64%, respectively, by 2030. Greece has also pledged to phase-out coal power entirely by 2028.\nRecently connected Italy has announced a coal phase-out by 2025, and aims to increase its share of renewable electricity to 55% by 2030 (from 40% in 2018, IEA).\nMontenegro generates a similar share of electricity from renewables, but the rest is entirely coal, meaning the grid intensity is higher. This gap is likely to increase as decarbonisation proceeds faster in Italy.\nSummary\nThe Western Balkans are well connected to EU neighbours, and electricity trades are relatively large in both directions. Despite being a net importer of electricity from EU neighbours, WB are a net exporter of carbon emissions, due\n26\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nto high grid intensities. The energy and climate targets of WB countries indicate that fossil sources will continue to dominate power generation until at least 2025. Meanwhile, the largest EU importers of WB electricity (Greece, Croatia, and potentially Italy) have declared ambitions for much faster power sector decarbonisation. Increases in the already high volumes of interconnection increases the risk that emissions saved through EU power sector decarbonisation will be 'offshored' to the WB.\nEgypt < Cyprus & Greece\n\nSchematic map of proposed interconnection between Libya/ Egypt/Israel and EU member states Greece and Cyprus\nGR\n4\nTR\nAV»\n@ o¢\nCoal plants\n@ Operating\n-----@----.-\n© Planned\nim)\nCapacity (GW)\n® ©\n@ 3\n@ 4\n@>=\ngCO./kWh\nJO\nEY\n600\n400\nEG\n200\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation.

The section linking Greece to Egypt is due to be commissioned in 202172.\nEnergy development plans\nUsing 2017 data, we estimate that Egypt had a slightly lower grid intensity than Greece (485 vs 560gCO2/kWh). However, power generation in Egypt is firmly on a fossil trajectory, whereas Greece has already begun decarbonising. In Egypt, Government bans on coal imports and coal power generation were lifted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, and two large coal power plants are currently proposed totalling 10.6GW, with a tender already awarded for the enormous 6.6GW Hamrawein plant. Egypt is also experiencing a natural gas boom. The discovery of the Zohr gas field in the Mediterranean has doubled Egypt's natural gas reserves, and prompted investment in new gas generation. Siemens has been contracted to construct and operate the three biggest CCGT plants in the world (3 x 4.8GW), increasing Egypt's installed capacity by over 40%. These developments vastly outweigh progress on renewable installations, which only made up 7% of installed capacity and 8% of generation in 20187°. The Government has set renewable generation targets of 22% and 42% by 2022 and 2035 respectively. Israel has 4.9GW of operational coal, but has announced this will close before 2025, and is likely to be replaced by gas. Libya has no coal capacity, but still produces carbon intensive electricity owing to its exclusive use of oil and gas.\nIn contrast, power sector emissions in Greece are declining (~40% decline 2007 - 2016, draft NECP), and faster decarbonisation plans have been outlined. These include phasing-out all 4GW of existing coal power by 2028, and a commitment to increase renewable electricity consumption to 61% by 2030. Cyprus currently generates 9% of its electricity from renewables (2017, IEA), but has expressed an ambition to increase this. The 2015 Renewable Energy Roadmap [7] co-produced by the Cypriot Government and IRENA, concluded that between 25-40% is possible by 2030.\nSummary\nThe EuroAfrica and EuroAsia interconnectors will connect the decarbonising grid of Greece, and Cyprus, to new fossil generation in Egypt, coal power in Israel, and gas and oil power plants in Libya. The electricity imported will not pay a carbon price. As Greece phases-out 4GW of coal power by 2028, and Egypt constructs\n22. https://www.euroafrica-interconnector.com/historicagreement/\n23.

While the interconnector will deliver benefits for renewables and system security on both sides, without a border adjustment it will incentivise fossil generation Egypt, Israel, and Libya. It will also slow the transition in Greece and Cyprus by providing a source of cheap, carbon intensive energy. A border carbon adjustment would accelerate the deployment of clean alternatives on both sides of the Mediterranean.\n29\nES\nSI\nSN\nal\nA Border Carbon Adjustme\non electricity\na\nWe propose that a border carbon adjustment is introduced for electricity entering the EUETS region, until the trading partner in question implements an equivalent emissions trading scheme or carbon price of their own.\nHere we explain why this would further the goals of the EU ETS, and discuss some key design features that it is important to get right for the full benefits to be delivered.\nBenefits\nA BCA on electricity would:\nDefend the integrity of EU climate policy by preventing the offshoring of power sector emissions.\ne\nLevel the playing field for all generators operating in the same markets.\nProtect progressive investments of governments and companies. We have shown that some of the highest-ambition EU member states will remain exposed to imports of carbon intensive electricity, just when investment in low carbon alternatives is needed in order to achieve climate goals.\nGenerate revenue for the EU. Revenue that could be used to support environmental projects or monitoring in neighbouring countries (generating political capital), or protect vulnerable customers from any electricity price increases.\nIncentivise carbon pricing in neighbouring countries. Rather than see revenue streams going to the EU, they may wish to redirect to themselves This could instigate a domino effect of carbon pricing in EU neighbours.\n30\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nUnintended consequences\nWhile the benefits are significant, introducing a BCA could result in some unintended consequences, specifically:\ne Resource shuffling. This is a specific type of carbon leakage, where an exporter lowers their obligation by substituting electricity with lower- carbon intensity, while exporting high-carbon electricity with other trade partners. The risk of resource shuffling is highest in markets with large variations in carbon intensity, and a large global scope. While the former is true for electricity production, the latter is not, due to physical constraints on transporting power. There is some evidence for resource shuffling in the Californian ETS (which includes electricity) [8], where some load- serving entities have divested from coal contracts. Another channel for resource shuffling is the direct purchase of low-carbon electricity for import, by mechanisms like power purchase agreements or renewable energy certificates. Energy price increases. Detailed modelling would be needed to assess the effect on electricity bills. Depending on the extent to which importers absorb the additional carbon costs, some may be passed down to end users. The revenues generated by the BCA could be used to mitigate this consequence, as the costs should be met by polluters, not citizens.\nDesign\nA BCA on electricity could take one of two forms: a tariff on imports at the border, or the requirement that importers purchase allowances to cover embodied emissions. The only operational BCA on electricity - under the Californian ETS - takes the latter approach. Under that scheme, “first deliverers” of electricity imports™* are liable to purchase credits to cover the estimated emissions. A separate Sandbag publication compares the two proposed methods, and explores in more detail the issues around BCAs in the EU in general.\nMuch attention has been paid to whether a BCA would comply with international trade law. More specifically, by causing imports to be treated differently, it’s possible a BCA would not comply with the non-discrimination principle of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Article Ill. A recent review [9] offers insights into the likely issues, and highlights how the legal validity would depend on specific design features. It is our view that a BCA on electricity could be designed in a compliant way. In short, this is because the carbon content of imports is measurable, and the EU ETS provides an explicit carbon price at which to charge them.\n24. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17: In the Californian ETS, according to section §95811(b), “first deliverers” of electricity include generating facilities, operators of electricity generating facilities located in California, and electricity importers. According to section §95812(c), importers are liable for “All emissions reported for imported electricity from specified sources of electricity that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year are considered to be above the threshold. All emissions reported for imported electricity from unspecified sources are considered to be above the threshold”.\n31\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nHere we offer some design recommendations, which apply regardless of the specific mechanism adopted (ETS or tariff). These would help deliver the benefits highlighted above, mitigate the unintended consequences, and minimise the risk of legal challenge.\nThree key features:\n1 Accurate calculation of the carbon intensity of imports\nThis is fundamental to setting the level of adjustment, and the choice of method has important legal implications. The carbon intensity of electricity generation varies enormously, from country to country and hour to hour. Consequently, a fair mechanism would measure the carbon intensity of imports in near real-time. This would require intraday (~hourly) data on generation by fuel type, which is available from some but not all neighbouring countries via ENTSO-E and national TSOs.\nStrictly speaking, the most accurate estimate of carbon intensity would be that of the real-time marginal unit in each exporting country. That is because the direction of flow is determined by the differences in wholesale price - flowing from low to high - and the marginal unit generates in the lower price region to satisfy the additional demand created by the interconnector. However, the highly connected nature of the European grid makes the marginal intensity very challenging to calculate in practice, despite recent progress [1].\nIn lieu of hourly generation data, or an estimate or marginal intensity, in this analysis we simply applied an average carbon intensity for each exporting country. In Box 2 we provide a worked example of how a similar approach could be put into practice. Using an average carbon intensity over some period has several benefits. It is simple, reducing the administrative burden; and it is transparent, which could ease political opposition. An average will underestimate the real carbon intensity on systems where the marginal technology is carbon intensive. However, this may be beneficial. GATT Art III.2 states that no taxes “in-excess” of internal taxes should be applied to imports of like products. A conservative estimate of carbon would therefore mitigate against this being breached.\nPerhaps the most difficult aspect of trade law to satisfy in this design is the need to avoid country-specific treatment. The calculation of carbon intensity as we have described it is inherently country specific. However, instead of national averages, estimates could use generation data for a country, combined with international benchmarks for the carbon intensity different technologies. Also, it has been suggested that foreign\n32\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\n33\nproducers should be afforded the ability to document actual emissions, demonstrating where they are lower than an international average. This would also add leverage to the BCA.\nIn ENTSO-E, there is a good basis for providing the detailed generation data needed to estimate the carbon intensity of imports. The provision of such data would need to be part of any legislative proposal. Finally, it is worth noting that these carbon calculations could be applied ex-post, if there was a lag in data availability. Forecasting of the approximate generation mix at the hourly level, and therefore the likely border adjustment rate, is within the capability of most market participants.\nNo rebates for EU generators\nWe do not believe that rebates should be given to EU generators for their carbon costs, as the objective should be that all power generated or consumed in the EU pays a carbon price. A border carbon adjustment would introduce this for imports. Removing the cost for EU exports in the form of a rebate would be a protectionist measure, and could incentivise emissions increases.\nTime-limited and participatory\nThe proposed BCA is meant to adjust for the difference in climate policy cost between EU and non-EU electricity generators, which we have shown is causing carbon leakage by incentivising coal generation over the EU border. It should therefore only remain in place as long as this difference exists. To avoid becoming entrenched, the expiration of the BCA should be prescribed, and only extended if warranted to prevent carbon leakage. Also, the methodology should be transparent and accessible for affected countries, and the border rate should account for equivalent policy costs in those countries. For example, owing to its domestic carbon price, Ukraine would currently receive a small reduction in its border adjustment, increasing in-step with the level of the domestic price.\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nBOX 2\nExample: Turkey in 2018\nBorder tariff\nWe estimate the carbon intensity of the Turkish grid in 2017 was 492tCO2/ GWh. Taking an indicative ETS price for 2018 of €24/tCO2 would give a flat- rate BCA tariff for Turkey in 2018 of €12/MWh (24 [€/tCO2] x 0.492 [tCO2/ MWh]). The same method could be applied to any time period for which an estimate of carbon intensity is available, the shorter the better, to capture real variations in carbon intensity.\nETS allowances\nUsing the above emissions factor, gross imports from Turkey to Greece in 2018 (2.9TWh) emitted 1.4MtCO2. The importer (interconnector) of this electricity would therefore be liable to surrender 1.4m ETS allowances.\n34\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nReferences\n1) Tranberg et al. 2019.

        "feedback": "Observations in anticipation to the impact assessment for a future Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n\nLegal basis\n\nIt is yet not clear whether this mechanism be proposed under a tax regime or in the form of customs duties. Clarity on this matter is necessary as this has a bearing on the legal basis, the delimitation of competences as established in the treaties and the decision making process (unanimity in the case of taxation).  \n\nInternational framework\n\nThe future impact assessment should investigate whether a proposed directive is compliant under the World Trade Organisation framework. Taxation on imported goods (other than customs duties/charges which are bound by WTO GATT) for any specific policy objective, are subject to National Treatment basis – in short, the measure cannot discriminate against foreign products. This seems to be the thinking in the inception impact assessment document. However, this also raises other considerations on how to design / administer such an instrument so as to avoid a burdensome instrument, ensure its efficient enforcement and prevent fraudulent practices by exporters / importers of covered goods.  \n\nEconomic/trade analysis\n\nAccording to the attached NSO data, imports in MT from third countries (including the UK because of BREXIT, but excluding Switzerland and ships and aircraft storage) result to Euro 3.79 billion (grand total 7318.1, less shipment & aircraft 0.2, less EFTA 58.7, less EU 4821.5, plus UK BREXIT 1352.9).  The sectors are found on page 5 of the attached NSO press release.  The Commission is yet to disclose the sectors it intends proposing to be subject to the carbon border adjustment mechanism.  It is important that the impact assessment would investigate whether importation from third countries could be easily substituted at a justifiable cost from importation from within the EU (excluding the UK, post BREXIT).\n\nThe impact assessment does not dwell on whom to attribute the calculation of carbon emissions on each product.  Is it up to the exporter, customs etc to calculate emissions? More details would be required so that an appropriate assessment may be prepared.  \n\nMandatory analysis in conjunction with each Member State\n\nThe impact assessment from the Commission calls for the competitivity of the single market as a whole vis a vis third countries.  Malta reiterates that the single market is comprised of different Member States’ economies, some of which, as in the case of Malta with inherent specificities.  Limited land resources, dependence on imported energy supplies and double insularity, lead to dependence on imports to sustain both economic and social welfare such that the Maltese economy ranks amongst the most open economies in the world. Such particularities give a different character to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the Maltese context since it risks rendering uncompetitive goods and services that are produced in Malta.  \n\nInsofar, a one size fits all carbon border adjustment mechanism, which does not address these inherit particularities, would fall short from creating a harmonised single market, but de facto would allow for severe competitive distortions between Member States.  In other words, there is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals, and would contradict cohesion policy within the Single Market.  \n\nThough upholding the Paris Agreement is noble in its own right, the Commission ought to study whether the proposed mechanism is proportionate to the likely economic disruption of Member States, heavily dependant on importation, and whether the shift from third country imports to EU imports is viable from an economic perspective. Furthermore, the proposal needs also to be studied from a distributional perspective, particularly assessing the impact of higher import prices on more vulnerable groups in society.\n",

The EU should pursue an ambitious implementation of the European Green Deal, including the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and a package of enhanced policies and measures to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. At the international level, the EU should continue cooperating towards an effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments in other countries, thus enhancing the global response to climate change while also reducing the risk of carbon leakage\n•\tThe risk of carbon leakage needs to be addressed with existing and new instruments, aiming in the first place at maximizing global climate protection while safeguarding EU competitiveness. An ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement by all Countries is the most effective way to reduce GHG emissions. While comparable carbon constraints are not in place and an actual risk of carbon leakage exists, the effectiveness of enhancing existing measures should be assessed and compared with possible alternative solutions such as a Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA).  The assessment should include evaluating the impacts both at sector/product level and at EU level, taking especially into account those global technological supply chains most critical to the energy transition, such as renewable energy technologies and batteries\n•\tA CBA should focus only on imports in order to maximize the legal compatibility with international treaties such as WTO and UNCCC.  The design and scope of the CBA should be consistent with non-discriminatory principles of trade treaties and with UNFCCC principles, which foresee more responsibility and efforts by developed Countries compared with developing ones. Applying the CBA only to imports is more likely to be compatible with WTO rules. Its application also to exports, while increasing its overall mitigation impact, makes it more questionable from a trade perspective  \n•\tThe choice and design of the policy instrument should consider its technical, market and political feasibility. Options could include a carbon tax on selected products – both on imported and domestic products, a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports, or the extension of the EU ETS to imports. Extending EU ETS to imports would maximize the overall feasibility of a CBA, simplifying its technical implementation, minimizing market distortions, favoring political adoption at EU level and easing discussions at international level, as the type of instrument and the level of carbon constraints applied to imports would be aligned with the EU domestic approach \n•\tThe possible adoption of a CBA should be considered together with a phase out of free allocation for the same sectors or products in order to be compatible with WTO rules.  The CBA should be applied to all imports in terms of import fees.  In order to avoid duplication and be compatible with WTO rules, its implementation would require the phasing out of the current regime of free allocation\n•\tTo overcome the technical challenges a staged approach should be tested characterized by increasing levels of accuracies. The starting stage would apply to imports country specific carbon border taxes based on simplified estimates of national carbon intensity. Later stages, triggered by bilateral agreements, would involve using certified exporting country generated data to review the country specific taxes and/or develop sector specific carbon border taxes. At the same time, it is necessary to consolidate and standardize carbon foot-print tracking methodologies applied to global supply chains in order to collect the data required for an effective and efficient  Carbon Border Adjustment implementation (i.e. carbon emissions along the full life cycle)",

Rusal’s PA and PA alloys are subject to the EU import duties of 3-6 %. \n\nAluminium sector with 1.1 Gt CO₂ e accounts for 2 % of global anthropogenic emissions. Rusal measures carbon footprint of its operations and supports industry-wide decarbonisation. Sourcing more than 90 % of electricity supply from renewable hydro energy, Rusal is one of the leading low-carbon aluminium (LCA) producers. \n\nRusal is a largest supplier of PA to EU processors of aluminium — a downstream sector dominated by SMEs — and is concerned that:\n-\toptions for the EU unilateral and sector-specific Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) could undermine competitiveness of its customers in case the CBAM is not fully WTO-compliant;\n-\tCBAM could fail to support the already distressed PA production in the EU and not cope with efficiently reducing the so-called ‘carbon leakage’ caused by energy costs in the EU, i.e. by the EU ETS;\n-\tnone of the discussed CBAM options appears to be in full compliance with the WTO rules, which may lead to severe and time-consuming trade disputes.\nEven a WTO-compatible CBAM does not offer appropriate environmental and trade policy measures for at least those carbon-intensive sectors, which have long moved capacities outside the EU due to the lack of raw materials, high energy and labour costs. The PA sector is a case in point of that. \n\nSince 2000, the EU PA smelting capacity shrunk by ca. 30 %, while the EU consumption of PA grew by approximately the same percentage. Today, the EU meets ca. 75 % of its PA needs through imports, that is expected to continue. \n\nIn this regard, there is little carbon leakage in the EU PA sector, as: \n1) no new smelters were commissioned in the EU for at least 30 years as a result of high costs, primarily in electricity and labour; \n2) reductions in the specific CO2 emissions of the existing EU smelters can only be achieved in external electricity supply, which accounts for 30-40 % of smelters’ costs. \n\nThe inclusion of PA in the scope of CBAM will inevitably drive up the price of imported and domestic PA in the EU. For downstream companies who employ more than 90 % of the industry’s workforce the cost of PA can constitutes 40 to 80 % of the total. Any unilateral increase of those costs may trigger further “drain” of production from the EU. \nIn order to deliver on the European Green Deal and to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2050, CBAM should employ tailored approach to such essential products as PA. \n\nThe European Commission (EC) may wish to consider permanent unilateral import tariff suspension vis-à-vis products with low carbon content, such as LCA. Rusal has been proactive in industry-wide efforts to define LCA benchmark reflecting average performance and would be pleased to share the available knowledge.\n\nThe tariff exemptions for LCA are achievable through a separate CN code and a reliable system of CO2 footprint certification. Such approach could apply only to selected products that are currently subject to substantial WTO-bound import tariffs of >2 % in the EU. It would be fully compliant with the WTO rules, would support the EU in its climate agenda and level playing field for the EU downstream.\n\nAdditionally, CBAM could encourage industry-wide incentives for research collaboration for decarbonization and sustainability. This could cover inert anode and other breakthrough technologies for emissions/cost reductions, x-ray/sensor-based/laser detection technologies for recycling, among others.\n\nRusal welcomes the guidelines on CBAM and a fair, transparent, and inclusive process and would be pleased to share its expertise on the optimal ways of making the EU CBAM truly viable for the low-carbon future, and  ready for swift implementation.\n",

We believe the EU ETS, with its cost compensation, is the most cost- effective policy measure to achieve greenhouse gas reductions in the EU while avoiding carbon leakage. The Commission then states that the “starting point of the exercise will be the new baseline scenario of the EU Green Deal and its higher ambition for 2030”. IFIEC believes that an increase of the EU’s climate policy ambition should in parallel be accompanied with an enhanced set of policy measures that provide the European industry with an effective carbon leakage protection.\n1.1 Type of policy instrument\nThe Commission states in the IIA that it will carefully assess the legal and technical feasibility of different policy options and their compatibility with the EU’s trade acquis and other international commitments of the EU as well as the EU’s Emission Trading System (EU ETS) and existing policy measures that aim at reducing the risk carbon leakage. Three policy measures are listed in the IIA as possible options for the implementation of a CBAM: 1) a carbon tax on selected products, 2) a carbon customs duty or tax on imports, 3) an extension of the EU ETS on imports. In relation to this, the Commission has stated in its Communication “A New Industrial Strategy for Europe”: “Should differences in ambition around the world persist, the Commission will propose a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in 2021 to reduce the risk of carbon leakage, in full compatibility with WTO rules. This should be supported by strengthening current tools to tackle carbon leakage. m1 our\nWe welcome the approach of the Commission to strengthen the EU’s current tools to prevent carbon leakage. Further developing and strengthening the existing policy mix is essential to provide an effective carbon leakage protection. A CBAM must be considered as an additional complementary possible option. In the assessment, the Commission should also assess the way to improve existing policy measures, as these policy measures have proven to be somewhat effective’ in the past to prevent carbon leakage and would only need to be partially adapted to provide better protection.\nIFIEC Europe agrees with the Commissions statement in the IIA that a careful assessment of the legal and technical feasibility of a CBAM should be carried out. Assessing the impacts of a CBAM in general and the impacts of its different policy design options on the EU ETS as well as its compliance with international treaties and law is highly important. IFIEC Europe notes that some further aspects should be taken into account: the assessment should also encompass aspects related to the political feasibility, including options for the implementation of a global monitoring system in collaboration with third countries.\n1\nEuropean Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, A New Industrial Strategy for Europe, COM(2020) 102 final, p. 8.\n2\nCarbon and investment leakage have occurred in some sectors, despite the introduction of measures for carbon leakage protection. In the European non-ferrous sector 10 out of 35 primary aluminum smelters that were based inside the EU have closed. Investments have been redirected to third countries and the production has subsequently been replaced by CO2 intensive imports from these countries.\n2\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nRif <C europ c\nntemati nal feder\nstrial energy consul\n1.2 Methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products\nThe Commission considers benchmarks as an approach to implement a CBAM and states: “To the extent that a sector is covered by the EU ETS, a border measure could be based on similar methodological considerations as for the ETS, i.e. benchmark values [...]”. IFIEC Europe notes that an approach that relies on carbon intensity could result in high administrative costs (see section 2.3 below). Moreover, not all production processes of a sector participate in the EU ETS. Implementing a CBAM with benchmark values would therefore either require that a) the CBAM and its benchmarks applies to all importers as well as non-ETS producers? or b) that the CBAM and its benchmarks applies only to imports that are manufactured in facilities with characteristics similar to those listed in Annex | of the EU ETS directive.\n[e) Option a): including non-ETS installations in the CBAM would result in double pricing, as various EU member states have introduced carbon pricing mechanisms at the national level in form of carbon taxes as well as national trading schemes. The CBAM would in this case increase the risk of carbon leakage substantially, unless the national carbon pricing policies are removed. [e) Option b): including only installations from third countries in the CBAM that match the characteristics of Annex | of the EU ETS directive would require the collaboration with third countries and independent verifiers. Proofing and monitoring that a product was indeed manufactured in an ETS-like installation would be necessary to avoid that products are falsely declared as being manufactured in non-ETS-like installations to circumvent the CBAM.\nThe Commission has stated that it will assess alternative approaches such as defining the carbon content of products. We agree that alternative methodological approaches should be analysed. A system for disclosing the carbon content of a product has not been developed so far. The data that would be required for this approach would at least include the information about the content of the product, the carbon footprint of each of the production processes involved in the production of each component (direct and indirect emissions)*. To take the whole value chain intro account, the Commission should also consider the emissions related to the transportation of imported products. Also, this approach would require the cooperation of third countries and independent verifies.\n1.3 Sectoral scope\nIn relation to the sectors that could be covered by a CBAM, the Commission states in its IIA that “[a]n important part of the work will also relate to the selection of sectors subject to this measure. A scoping in terms of sectors concerned will have to be defined to ensure that the measure applies where the risk of carbon leakage is the highest”. We believe that sectors at risk of carbon leakage should all be equally well protected and argue that this should not automatically result in the introduction of a CBAM. Rather, a policy measure should fit the needs of the industry.

We agree that the impacts a CBAM would have on these dimensions should be assessed carefully.\n2.1 The economic dimension\nWith regard to the economic dimension, the Commission specifically aims at assessing the impact on industrial value chains and effects on downstream and upstream sectors as well as economic efficiency of the policy measure. IFIEC believes that this is necessary, especially in case the CBAM would not be applied to finished goods due to the complexity of the model but more to upstream goods or activities: implementing a CBAM at the EU border would increase the prices of upstream goods that are imported and subsequently processed in installations within the EU. It will be important for the impact assessment to calculate the estimated increased costs of the CBAM throughout the value chain, and whether this in turn would result in an increased import of finished goods in Europe.\nThe Commission also aims at analysing the effects a CBAM would have on third countries and their markets. We believe that such an assessment is relevant. The analysis should be conducted in a transparent way and should closely involve all the stakeholders concerned. IFIEC believes that a structured dialogue and cooperation between the Commission and the industry- and energy sector must be established in addition to the envisaged public consultation, to thoroughly discuss and investigate the regulatory and trade related framework needed to prevent carbon leakage and to successfully master the transition to a low carbon economy.\nThe Commission states in the IIA that it expects positive impacts of a CBAM on research and innovation as well as the development of low-carbon products. IFIEC Europe believes that such an effect will only be realised, if certain additional conditions are met. The development of breakthrough technologies for the production of low-carbon products will require additional financial support, which must not be limited to technology innovation support, but also cover new applications and scale ups. To bridge the so-called ‘valley of death’, market barriers for low-carbon innovations must be removed.\nIf the EU would increase its climate targets for 2030 to 50 % to 55 % and would introduce a CBAM whilst other third countries would not raise their ambitions related to climate protection, export- oriented sectors would face the issue that their existing products become more and more uncompetitive at the world market, due to a rising EU ETS price and low or no carbon prices abroad, whilst low carbon products are not competitive on the world market either, due to the fact that in most cases the investment and operational costs of low carbon processes are much higher compared to existing production processes. Therefore, indirect cost compensation and free allocation should be maintained and improved and a rebate for exported goods for carbon avoidance costs should be foreseen to protect export-oriented production from the risk of carbon leakage. If a cross sectoral\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\n4\nKRifie\nntemati nal federatic strial energy consur\ncorrection factor is applied, the rebate should also apply to exports of current products, while taking into account which carbon leakage protection measures exist per sector.\nIf a CBAM is introduced the revenues should be primarily used to support exports. The remainder of the revenues should be used to reduce electricity cost of small and large-scale consumers. Reducing electricity prices is key for the success of the Green Deal, as most low-carbon production processes will either be using electricity directly or indirectly (e.g. via hydrogen and synthetic fuels produced form electricity). Other parts of the revenues should be used to facilitate research and development of low- carbon technologies as well as their market uptake and further improvement (e.g. energy and resource efficiency). We believe that a CBAM will not suffice to create a low-carbon economy and that the European industry further needs support of the European Commission and EU Member States.\n2.2 The social dimension\nThe Commission points out that a CBAM could lead to price increases of consumer products, including products for basic needs. IFIEC requests an in-depth reflection on carbon pricing policies that focus on a carbon signal in production and consumption. The Commission should consider to mitigate these impacts by reducing other cost that consumers must bear. As stated above reducing electricity cost of industrial consumers can help to facilitate the market uptake of low carbon technologies. Reducing electricity cost can also help to make manufacturing less expensive, which in turn could mitigate price increases of consumer products.\n2.3. The administrative dimension\nThe Commission states in the IIA that the introduction of a CBAM may require traders and authorities “to determine the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of an imported product” and that “[aJncillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries may be needed”. There is currently no system in place neither in the EU nor at global level to determine and compare the carbon footprint of domestic and foreign products and/or producers. A robust monitoring, reporting and verification system will need to be established, ensuring legal certainty and equal treatment of international competitors.\nFrom our point of view, determining the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of an imported product is a must or in other words an essential precondition for the functioning of a CBAM. Without the proper knowledge about the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a production process a CBAM is prone to fail, as companies from third countries could otherwise claim that their products are carbon neutral and generate windfall profits.\nThe Commission has noted in its IIA that the administrative burden should be minimized and proposed to this end to use greenhouse gas emission benchmarks for imports from third countries. If a company certifies “a lower carbon content and/or a higher carbon cost at origin” for its product, the CO» cost related to the product would be adjusted. This approach would limit the need to assess the production process of companies in third countries to cases where companies prove that the carbon content of their product is below the benchmark. Ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries would still have to be conducted ona regular basis to verify the actual emissions related to a product. Therefore, verifications should be conduction by an independent international\n5\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nKifiec europ c\ninternational federation of strial energy consul\norganisation. If the Commission considers to use a benchmark-based approach, the CBAM should apply a uniform benchmark. Differentiating between different third countries, country groups or regions could encourage exploitation. Products from one country with a relatively high benchmark could be transported other countries with lower benchmarks and exported from there into the EU.\n3 Conclusion\nIn addition to the existing carbon leakage policy measures, additional protection is required. Therefore, IFIEC welcomes that the Commission will conduct an impact assessment. We suggest that this in-depth reflection should be extended to carbon pricing policies in general and on all possible policy options that would help mitigate carbon and investment leakage for exposed industries with regard to import and export. We would like discuss our arguments and ideas for a future EU energy and climate policy with the Commission in more detail, to further contribute to the successful implementation of the European Green Deal.\nAbout IFIEC Europe\nIFIEC Europe represents 13 national European associations that comprise - on a cross-sectoral level - those industrial sectors for which energy is a significant component of production costs.

Independently from the future impact of this crisis which cannot yet be anticipated, the impact assessment by the Commission of the proposed Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) mechanism should primarily try to understand if, when and how can CBAs strengthen existing carbon leakage measures. The impact assessment should also assess how the mechanism can preserve the competitiveness of EU products on export markets. The impact assessment should also address the fact that for sectors with similar characteristics as in the ceramic industry, CBAs do not appear to be neither feasible nor efficient in strengthening carbon leakage measures. Consequently, it will be even more important for these sectors to maintain the existing system of free allocations for best performers, potentially combined with other complementary policy instruments.\nIn particular: \nCarbon Border Adjustments should be designed to strengthen carbon leakage protection in the long term\nDepending on the outcome of the ongoing decision making process on ETS benchmark updates and on the fluctuations of the carbon price (from 30€ to 50 €/tCO2), the European ceramic industry anticipates an ETS cost under Phase IV ranging from € 1 Billion to € 3 Billion, assuming that carbon leakage measures and the 2030 targets for the ETS sector remain unchanged.  In the absence of any carbon leakage measure, the cost for the sector would range from € 3.8 Billion to € 6.3 Billion.  Over the last years the European ceramic industry has done great investments to maintain its competitiveness in a globalised economy and reduce the carbon content of its products.  Any decrease of the carbon leakage protection foreseen until 2030 would significantly jeopardise the ability of the sector to further invest in new and breakthrough technologies or to develop key technologies further to bring them to the market (marketability). \n\nPolicies merely increasing carbon costs on EU manufacturing without duly considering the carbon leakage risk will reduce EU carbon emissions from manufacturing as a result of relocation but will increase the EU’s consumed carbon due to imports from countries with lower or non-existing carbon costs on manufacturing.  That is why the main objective of CBAs should be to strengthen existing carbon leakage measures.  \n\n",

Hydro operates primary aluminium smelters, and plants in recycling, rolling and extrusion. Aluminium inherent properties like light weight, high strength, formability, conductivity and durability make aluminium an attractive material, thus resulting in increased use of aluminium worldwide.\nWe welcome the EU climate policy and the European Green Deal (EGD) which will be the core framework for European electro-intensive industries in the years to come. Our production of recycled and low carbon aluminium will provide an important contribution to the ambitions in the EGD. Hydro are amongst the producers with the lowest carbon footprint in the industry, and we are constantly striving to improve our performance. We will continue to have an ambitious sustainability agenda and recently launched our new climate strategy by which we aim to reduce our GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 compared to our 2018 level.\nKey message\nWe strongly support the importance of preserving the competitiveness of European industries, which is rightly recognized in the Inception impact assessment (IIA) for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM).

In the Annex we describe how a CBAM needs be designed to benefit aluminium industry positively.\n1\nA global level playing field between industrial producers is essential to maintain the competitiveness of the European industry\nClimate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and reducing CO2-emission to limit global warming to 1,5 degrees will require substantial efforts across all sectors.\nA global CO2-cost would be the best way to achieve global CO2-emission reduction whilst ensuring a global level playing field for all industries. However, this is unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future. We fully support the EU European Emission Trading system (EU ETS), which aluminium is part of. To reduce the risk of carbon leakage, the EU has introduced carbon leakage measures to mitigate the actual risk of industrial closure and production decrease, namely free allocation for direct emissions and possibilities for Member States to compensate for CO2 costs in the power price, via State Aid policy.\nGiven our electro-intensive nature, aluminium is particularly exposed to risk of carbon leakage because of the indirect CO2 emissions costs (i.e. the CO2-price element passed on in power prices). Even Hydro, which is mainly based on non-emitting power sourcing has a substantial exposure to EU ETS cost through the carbon price incorporated in the power price, which is delinked from the electricity generation’s greenhouse gas footprint.\nIn addition, Hydro is also exposed to carbon leakage risk due to our direct emissions. To shield the aluminium industry a carbon exposed sector, fee allocation, up to calculated benchmark levels, serves as an instrument to reduce the risk of carbon leakage.\nWe are of the opinion that the existing measures are the most adequate carbon leakage protection measures for aluminium production in Europe, as they shield European producers from high carbon cost exposure which other global producers do not face, and thus ensuring a better level playing field between European and other producers.\n2\nCarbon border measure is not an adequate alternative carbon leakage measure for aluminium\nThe IIA specifies that CBAM is to be an alternative to existing carbon leakage measures, namely free allowances and indirect CO2 costs compensation.\ne The assumption that CBAM can be a carbon leakage measure in general must rest on the assumption that the tax will increase the price level on European products, and thus represent an opportunity for European producers to pass CO2-cost onto the product prices - an opportunity that does not exist today for aluminium. For CBAM to truly be a carbon leakage measure, the price effect should be 1-1 with the tax level. But whether such a price effect will be realized, will differ from market to market and product to product. Therefore, introduction of CBAM does not automatically imply increased carbon leakage protection, neither for indirect emission costs nor for direct emissions. The carbon leakage protection will depend on the degree of price effect from the CBAM, which again depends on the market and marginal importers of each product along the value chain. Furthermore, for a CBAM system to work, it would need to cover the whole value chain, upstream and downstream. If this would not be the case, customers buying primary aluminium might have an incentive to move downstream production out of Europe to avoid the effects of\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n2/8\nLegal unit: Hydro Energi AS P.O.Box 980 Skayen NO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nthe tax. Then the effect of CBAM would be lower primary aluminium demand in Europe and moving out of downstream production, and thus CBAM would have clear negative consequences.\n2.1 For aluminium, a CBAM based on carbon content of imports cannot be a sufficient measure for carbon leakage protection for the following reasons:\nIndirect CO2 costs - The biggest carbon leakage risk for European electro-intensive industry is indirect CO2 costs (the CO2-price element in power prices), see figure 2. Globally, it is only the European aluminium industry that faces such indirect CO2-costs. For primary aluminium, the indirect costs are 6-7 times larger than the direct costs. Electricity market price setting - Indirect CO2-costs depend on the specific price setting mechanism in the European electricity market and do not result from the physical fuel mix nor from its carbon content. For instance, Norway has almost 100% renewable electricity production, but still has a ‘price effect’ of the CO2-price on electricity price by 0,67' on all the electricity that industries consume. In other words, indirect CO2-costs are not correlated with indirect CO2- emissions. Indirect emissions vs indirect costs -Therefore, setting a CBAM on indirect emissions will not mitigate the carbon leakage risk linked to indirect CO2-costs for European aluminium producers. Hence, if a CBAM should be introduced for aluminium, it is essential that CO2- compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. CBAM vs CO2 compensation - The difference between CBAM and CO2-compensation can be illustrated as follows: [e) On average, there is a high carbon footprint in aluminium imported to the EU, anda CBAM means there will be a CO2 cost levied on imports. The potential price effects from the CBAM will however be based on the marginal importer. It is not unlikely that for primary aluminium, this will be Middle East producers. This production has a carbon footprint from indirect emissions that are higher than the European emissions, see figure 3. If a border mechanism carbon cost is calculated based on the emission level above the European average, this will mean a CO2-cost on imports from the Middle East. This cost level and potential price effect will however be far below the carbon leakage protection in CO2-compensation, see figure 4. If CO2-compensation, given at 75% aid intensity in the illustration, is replaced with CBAM in this case, this will mean that carbon leakage protection for European aluminium industry is wiped out, see figure 5.\n1 Cf IV of the 2012 Guidelines certain State aid in the context of the greenhouse emission annex on measures gas allowances trading scheme post-2012 for the CO2 emissions factors in the different geographical areas (tCO2/MWh): https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012XC0605(01)&from=EN\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n3/8\nFigure 2: Comparison of direct and indirect CO2-costs for different industries Source: Ecofys (2015)\nPrimary aluminum\nRefined copper\nSlab zinc\nproduction\nproduction\nproduction*\n16%\n@\n84%\n*Assuming all RLE is\nhydrometallurgical\nFerro-silicon and silicon\nmetal production\n77%\n77%\n0\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\nm Direct emissions costs = Indirect emissions costs\n(ex. process emissions)\nPulp & paper\nChemicals\nCeramics\n21%\nV\n79%\nii\nIndirect emissions ME\n6\n?

EU industries have relatively low carbon footprint compared to international competitors due to the low-carbon electricity production in Europe versus other countries, especially China with its high degree of coal fired power production, see figure 1. There is, however, no competitive advantage versus other regions with higher CO2-emissions in production. Today EU’s imported volumes of industrial products have a higher carbon footprint and at the same time most of the imported goods are produced in countries or regions with either no CO2-costs or a very low carbon cost compared to Europe.\nFigure 1: CO2-footprint in primary aluminium, Hydro and European average vs global average\nCoal\nCO2-emissions tonne aluminium\nper\n20,0\n18,0\n16,0\n* Small differences in direct\nemissions Global production has considerably larger CO2- emissions from indirect than European industry\n14,0\n12,0\nGas\n10,0\n8,0\n6,0\nRenewables\nNone outside Europe face any\n40\ncosts related to carbon content\n“ERR\naeeidalenun\nin power prices\né o e & a Ra & S\ns KS XP\n3G Ry Ro &\ng\nR\ne G\nKe)\nse\ns\nK\nRS)\n&f\n4\n‘y\nf Ra\n¢\n= Direct emissions Indirect emissions\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\n6/8\nVisiting address: Drammensveien 264 Oslo, Norway\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\nHow should a CBAM be designed to fit aluminium\n2\nAs explained in the previous paragraph, we are of the opinion that a carbon border measure is not an adequate carbon leakage mitigation measure for aluminium. If a CBAM should be introduced, it cannot replace current carbon leakage measures. It could be an additional tool to create a competitive advantage for low-carbon producers. In addition, if such a measure is to be introduced and be effective for aluminium, it needs to be carefully designed to avoid unintended effects with negative implications for industrial competitiveness. If not appropriately designed, such a measure could undermine rather than support the European aluminium industry.\nA model for an adequate carbon border tax adjustment-system for the aluminium sector should include the following criteria:\nA CBAM system should be designed to create a competitive advantage for low-carbon products and producers The purpose of a CBAM should be to add CO2-costs to high carbon imported products. This could create a competitive advantage for European producers with lower carbon footprint and give incentives to other producers to reduce their footprint to access the European market. Adding CO2-costs to imports does not automatically constitute a carbon leakage protection for European industry, and CBAM should therefore not be considered a carbon leakage measure. Current carbon leakage measures need to be preserved Both free allowances and indirect CO2-compensation must be continued alongside a CBAM-system. There is no certainty that a tax imposed on products will result in carbon leakage protection — that will depend on to what extent the tax allows European producers to pass on the CO2-costs into product prices. In addition: 1) EU Free allowances: If products in CBAM should be taxed for emissions above ETS-benchmark level, we would still nevertheless need free allowances to achieve a level playing field globally. Taking away free allocation up to the benchmark would lead to an additional carbon exposure for European industries that the importer will not face, 2) Indirect CO2-costs for European industry are not correlated with indirect CO2- emissions. Therefore, setting a CBAM on indirect emissions will not mitigate the carbon leakage risk linked to indirect CO2-costs. Hence, it is essential that CO2-compensation is kept alongside a CBAM. Asa CBAM does not imply carbon leakage protection for aluminium, keeping existing CO2- compensation would not create double compensation. A CBAM system needs to cover both direct and indirect emissions What differentiates carbon footprint of aluminium production globally is the indirect emissions (linked to the electricity consumption) in primary aluminium production. Hence, a system focusing only on direct emissions would not have the intended effect. A CBAM system needs to cover the whole value chain, upstream and downstream A CBAM system would work effectively if the system encompassed products from primary metal down to the final product. If this is not the case, customers buying aluminium might have an incentive to move downstream production out of Europe to avoid the effects of the tax. A CBAM system should focus on including emissions of the primary production The electrolysis process is where there are large differences in CO2-emissions in aluminium production globally, due to differences in indirect emissions. Other parts of the value chain have much less variation in emissions. The main focus should therefore be to include the carbon footprint of the primary metal embedded in all aluminium products throughout the downstream value chain.\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n718\nSystem requirements necessary to facilitate CBAM:\ne We need a legitimate system for disclosing carbon content of each product Today, there is no common system for disclosing the carbon content of imported products.

Introduction of CBAM could trigger WTO complaints against the EU by third countries and also some retaliatory trade measures.\nAll these criteria need to be fulfilled for a CBAM system to have a global climate effect and protect competitiveness of European industry.\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address: Drammensveien 264 Oslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n8/8"

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator and the second highest indirect emissions intensity among the 8 eligible sectors.\nThe European Steel Association\n1920\nIndirect emission\nTrade\nleakage indicator\nintensity\n(GOS instead of GVA)\nintensity\n[kg CO2 / EUR GOS]\nINAcE | 203-2015 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015\n1411 |Manufacture ofleatherclothes|__—_—3,029_— | 83,00% | 3,650\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\nefined petroleum products\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nSimilarly, the section 3.1.1 on aid intensity and degressivity of the consultants’ study assesses the impact of indirect costs (with a carbon price of 25€/t) after 75% compensation taking into account the GVA. In such assessment, among the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has around the fourth indirect costs impact (after 75% compensation), which is comparable to the sectors with the lower impact (blue bars below). Yet, if labour costs are excluded from the denominator (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector have very clearly the second highest impact (orange bars below), with a large difference above the remaining sectors.\nIndirect CO2 costs after 75% compensation\n5,4%\n5,0%\n4,3%\n4,0%\n2,9%\n3,0%\n2,3%\n2,1%\n2,0%\n1,9\n1,8%\n:\n1,39\n1,3%\n1,6%\n0 99\n0,99\n0,89\n0,9\n1,0%\n0,7\n0,69\n0,0%\n&\nxe)\nny\nCo\nSS\nov\n<2\nNo\nSS\nx2\n¥\ns\nNS\nRS\n<O\nSs\n<O\ngf\n&\ney\nS\nR\nNs\nSy\nBS\nAS\nNe’\nSS\n6\nRo\ny\nRNa\n»\nwv?\n&\nae\n&\ns”?\n<8\nSs\nKO\n‘Sy\ne\nPS\nwv?\n&\n<O\noe\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GVA\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GOS\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nThe above analysis is even more relevant if one considers the profitability of the eligible sectors.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Increased protectionism worldwide\nThird countries’ trade restrictions have increased since the imposition of the EU definitive safeguard measures, increasing the risk of trade diversion to the weakened European market\na Threats of the U.S. President to double again the 25% tariff on Turkish steel imports illustrates the extreme volatility in the implementation of the Section 232 policy on\nThe European Steel Association\n11\nsteel — and the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy (which is itself a source of deflection). Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

Carbone4 (http://www.carbone4.com/) calculated the carbon footprint of our company and of our products. In one year, we decrease our carbon footprint by 25% thanks to the optimisation of all levers (Clinker selection, logistics, cement recipes and packaging).\n=\nWe are convinced that the new carbon border adjustment mechanism would be a powerful tool to thrive for greener products.\nCem’In’Eu’s contribution\nTo contribute to the in-depth analysis Cem’In’Eu presents the following elements for consideration:\n] The EU should continue to work with global partners in applying ambitious carbon pricing, that will drive changes. It is thus crucial to ensure that the future mechanism will comply with World Trade Organisation rules. This requires a thorough analysis of the legal and practical feasibility of introducing such a mechanism. Importers and European actors must be treated equally in order to avoid any distortion of competition or unfair protection for old and polluting European cement industries. This mechanism is particularly relevant for the construction sector with the renovation wave announced by the Green Deal. Indeed, cement is the essential binder for the manufacture of concrete, which is involved in more than 80% of constructions. All initiatives must be carried out in a comprehensive approach to foster innovation and move from a status quo that was misused by cement industries for years. The EU should set the carbon border adjustment mechanism in a way that will incentivise investments made fo innovate for low carbon solutions. The carbon Border Adjustment mechanism would prevent innovation if it acts like a protective tax. A new carbon customs duty or tax on imports will not give the right signal to the industry. This is a matter of efficiency, as such a design will not incentivize old European cement industries to invest in low carbon solutions. Cem’In’Eu fully supports the idea of the extension of the EU ETS to imports with measures to safeguard the level playing field. New entrants, even from outside Europe, in the cement industry have the power to foster innovations and transform traditional industries. The carbon border adjustment mechanism should avoid complexity in design and administration. It should not be misused as a protectionist barrier that will benefit to less innovative or more polluting factories. Cem'In’Eu sees this mechanism as a way to massively scale up the cement industry’s contributions to the carbon neutral transition, by incentivizing the most efficient ways to lower emissions thanks to: a innovation that improves the energy performance of installations b a complete shake up of the supply chain taking into account the whole industrial process (upstream and downstream) To be efficient and fair, the tax must apply the same CO2 benchmark per ton of clincker as that in force for ETS 4. Moreover, new entrants, even importers should benefit from free ETS quotas based on the benchmark, for a fair measure. The previous EU ETS system until phase 4, created perverse effects that biased the system. Indeed, it did not generate a dynamic carbon price. In the definition of carbon content of products, the European Commission must integrate the full supply chain, not just the final product.\nCem’In’Eu is convinced that the carbon border adjustment mechanism is the right tool to foster innovation in the cement industry. It could create a momentum for a behavioural change if well coordinated with the EU ETS. The carbon adjustment mechanism, as a structural measure, must be built on the right design to be a cornerstone of the European Green Deal.\nWhat can be done to reduce now CO2 emissions?\nCem’In’Eu developed a new conception of the cement industry to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the product. We act on different elements to leverage our action:\nClinker selection: Our clinker producer operates with a new plant from 2015 whereas the last kiln built in France for example was in 1978. On average only 51% of the European producer used the most advanced technologies being dry process with preaheater and precalciner (https: ccassociation.or nr/). We know that modern plants use up to 40% less fuels than old “wet” process (https: ccassociation.or nr/). We also choose our clinker producer for logistics reason. The plant is based on a port, this avoids additional upstream logistics CO? emissions.\ne\nSupply Chain optimisation: We import our clinker by big vessels from Turkey to the port of Séte. The plant is located on the main Toulouse-Bordeaux railway line with existing branches leading to vacant sidings, one of which is exclusively for use by Aliénor Ciments. Clinker arrives at the site by train from Séte. To support its clinker logistics, Cem’In’Eu built a 60,000t clinker storage yard at the port of Séte, Cem’In’Log, allowing clinker to be transported directly to the plant by rail, the most efficient means of transport in terms of CO? per t/km.\nWe use a unique process, a bespoke container-based transport system, thus the clinker can be moved without any dust. Upon arrival each container is lifted individually by an automated overhead crane and loaded into the discharging position at an angle over the discharge bin, enabling a full train of 26 cars, loaded with 52 containers of 32 t of clinker each, allowing 1.680 t to be unloaded and reloaded in less than five hours. Every single journey of this train, with almost no CO? per t/km, avoids 60 truck on the road and the huge CO? emissions linked.\nv\nBy stopping the use of trucks to transport clinker from the port to plant, we reduced our CO? emissions by -10 kg of CO2/tonne of equivalent cement (calculation based on the Carbone 4 audit method)\nv\nThanks to an optimized supply chain, our upstream logistics emissions are equivalent to our downstream logistics emissions. The vessels emissions between Turkey and Séte and the rail between Séte and Tonneins, produce the same level of emissions (about 28kg of Co2) as the deliveries by trucks to our customers in our catchment areas of 200kms.\nPlant optimisation: Aliénor Ciments is a 0.24Mta cement grinding plant located in Tonneins. Its modular design enables it to be constructed quickly, efficiently and environmentally friendly. The mill uses around 105t of Vega grinding balls to grind the clinker. To reduce the nuisance of the grinding process, the mill building is covered in a special cladding to lower noise pollution by 32dB to 82dB when the mill is in operation. In terms of emissions control, air compressors are used to move material and any dust is contained. The plant is equipped with a Scheuch baghouse with 6.5m-long bags for dust capture. There is also a stack which only emits waste air from the process and dust is kept below 20mg/Nm3.\nVv\nThe plant — using Carbone 4 methodology with fixed assets & immobilization, energy consumption, company cars & vehicles, staff travel - produces only 5kg of CO2/tonne of equivalent cement\nCement recipes: As a cement producer we can change blends and reduce the proportion of clinker used.\n¥  Cem’in’Eu reduces the clinker factor and we reduce by -15kg of CO2/tonne of equivalent cement\nContact Cem'In’Eu Vincent Lefebvre, Président 1-2 allée Baco, 44300 Nantes - France v.lefebvre@cemineu.com\nWe are on the EU transparency register under to number: 50691 2037725-23\nFind out more at: www.cemineu.com"

We share the ambition of the initiative, stressing that as long as many international partners do not share the same Climate ambitions as the EU, there Is a risk of carbon leakage; meaning that there is a risk of production being transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emissions reduction, or that EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.\nThere is a choice here: securing the sugar supply of EU citizens either by a highly efficient, sustainable domestic industry or through external sources on which the regulatory framework of the EU has a very limited impact.\nSugar Sector\nThe EU sugar sector - in contrast to all of its global competitors - is now operating in a very liberalised market environment, becoming increasingly open to competition, due to the end of the production quotas on 30 September 2017. The EU is already granting preferential, tariff-free ac- cess for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACPs). The entry into force of a large number of new Free Trade Agreements entails enhanced compe- tition for EU manufacturers, and puts EU sugar manufacturers in an awkward competitive situa- tion, as sugar in third countries is often produced on the basis of lower social and environmental standards. In contrast, at global level, the EU sugar industry must trade on an uneven level playing field, at global level, with the major sugar-producing players receiving increasing trade-distorting public support and protection.\nIn the conditions described above, and because sugar is an international commodity, the EU market is inevitably affected by a world market price which does not represent real production costs.\n12018/19 Marketing Year Figures for EU-28; this sugar is produced from approximately 110 million tonnes or sugar beet.\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium\n& +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope\npage 2 of 4\nEU sustainable sugar production should not be undermined and replaced by cheap, unfair or illegal sugar imports sometimes travelling long distances.\nSugar manufacturing in the EU is currently subject to the highest standards and requirements of the world, when it comes to environmental protection, agricultural production and workers safety for instance.\nAmongst others, sugar manufacturing is regulated under the EU ETS (eg. heat and electricity production in high-efficient CHP generation, drying processes, lime production for purification of raw juice). Because of its high trade intensity (19,7 %) and its COz relevance, it is a sector part of the Carbon Leakage List.\nCEFS would therefore like to stress that, in any case, protection against carbon leakage needs to be ensured for the European sugar manufacturing sector,\nRecommendations\nThe proposed system of carbon border adjustment mechanism nevertheless brings questions:\n1 Scope of such mechanism: a Will tt encompass all sectors that are part of the Carbon Leakage List? If not, how will the selection be made? Will this system only take into account transformation, or additional parts of the value chain and environmental impacts? Could this policy option work well only on the import side (export reimbursement is not part of the present Commission's concept and would not be in accordance with WTO requirements)? If so, how to preserve the competitiveness of our exports? 2. Will the huge amount of necessary regulation be feasible? 3, What use will be made out of the revenues from this mechanism?\n1. Scope of the mechanism\na. The proposed system seems rather straightforward to set up for materials such as steel or cement (sectors eligible for state aid for indirect carbon costs compensation). However, when it comes to food products, and especially sugar, the system leaves room for interpretation. In case only transformation is counted, the impact of primary, raw materials and other co-products in the value chain (such as feed, fertilizers etc.) will not be collected and can lead to miscalculations, An alternative compensation system should then be put in place in this case.\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium\n& +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope\npage 3 of 4\nIt is moreover unclear whether such system will complement or replace the ETS rules. In order to guarantee a fair protection of the EU sugar manufacturing activities, CEFS advocates for the car- bon border mechanism to be used in additionto the ETS rules, and not instead of the ETS system.\nb, In food products, the agricultural upstream of production should be taken into account for this mechanism. In this way, land and soils use will be accounted for, as has been done in the past with ILUC in the RED Il. It should be recalled that EU sugar is made out of beet, a very efficient crop in terms of land use and water usage. Sugar produced outside the EU comes from cane, a tropical crop. In case the impact of cane on land is not taken into account in the mechanism, this could lead to undesirable situations of certain tropical forests being cut and burnt down in order to grow cane or to create space for other crops. This would be counterproductive and would not be in line with the Green Deal policies the EU Commission is currently putting in place.\nA further aspect that seems not to be taken into account is the fact that European sugar manufacturing brings further co-products as a result of the ETS-regulated processes of a beet sugar plant, such as: a large stillage of feed (several sorts of beet pulp), fertilizers (carbonatation lime), raw materials for fermentation and alcohol production. All of these products need to be taken into account by creating a system of CO. calculation for a border tax adjustment scheme to come to fair and coherent policy option replacing the present system of free allocations. Comparing sugar from abroad with European beet sugar needs to include the impact of those co-products into the scope of the future mechanism by allocating the correct emission share to each of these products. Only this procedure will represent a realistic carbon leakage protection, not mentioning the above-mentioned environmental impacts of our competitors on tropical crop level.\nc. While a protection on export level is not planned (and perhaps legally not feasible), a Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism (CBA) will constantly suffer only to manage one side of the carbon leakage medal. Therefore, facing an environment of distortion-free international trade relations, the question may be allowed whether it could really be a considerable policy option. If border (customs-based) measures cannot be implemented in order to fully cover the competitive gap (either on exports or imports), alternative and/or additional compensation systems should be envisaged.\nWe therefore request the European Commission to efficiently protect our sector with a more effective system taking into account the high performance of the EU sugar sector regarding agricultural, environmental and social standards,\n2. Bureaucracy\nNo doubt that a well working CBA will be based on a lot of results of international negotiations and well agreed international regulation. Facing the huge time and effort this will need to be achieved without any risk of retaliation measures from the WTO members, and the fact that it can only be an intermediate result on international level until 2050 we are asking whether it will not\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium\n& +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope\npage 4o0f4\nbe the smarter way to keep the present system and to put all negotiation power in finding a common CO: price on global level directly.\n3, Benefits of the CBA\nThe potential revenues stemming from the CBA should be allocated to the transition to a low-carbon economy of our European industry.\nCEFS therefore requests for a fair treatment of EU industries in order to be protected against carbon leakage, for coherence and consistency between regulations and policies when proposals are made by the EU. Furthermore, we consider that a more global approach (taking into account production modes among others) in determining the scope of the mechanism for food products is required, especially for sugar.\nCEFS remains available for more information or any question you may have.\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium & +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope"

It must allow for fair competition at global level and not simply to outsource “pollution”. While respecting the rules of the World Trade Organisation, the aim of this mechanism would be to be a key industrial policy tool in pursuit of a number of complementary objectives: \n\n1. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;\n2. Defending the highly strategic industrial sectors (such as the steel industry) of the European Union and thus defending the quality employment of workers employed directly or indirectly in these sectors;\n3. the application of fair competition at global level.\n\nThe reduction of greenhouse gases in energy intensive industries is generally achieved through innovation of disruptions. However, these technologies and disruptive innovations are and will become (increasingly) expensive, which could have a negative impact on employment in Europe if they are not properly managed, accompanied and supported. Therefore, it is crucial that the EU’s carbon adjustment policy is not in place on its own. It must be accompanied by a coherent set of policy measures (financial, fiscal, social, etc.). Thus, a policy/legal/regulatory/competitive environment conducive to innovation should be a prerequisite for the introduction of the carbon adjustment principle at the borders of the European Union. Specific measures in the award of public procurement could also be envisaged. The creation of a market that will be able to welcome these innovations is therefore essential. Similarly, a mechanism should be developed to support export industries. It is imperative to ensure that the impact of these measures on all parts of the value chain is properly assessed... without forgetting the establishment and maintenance of a genuine social dialogue with trade union organisations (at all levels: At European level, Member States, regions and each company concerned). The whole of the system, by any inadequacy, cannot, under any circumstances, miss its target... and damage entire sectors, building on the European industrial fabric. Conversely, care must be taken that one or more measures do not promote deadweight effects. Finally, the implementation of this body will not be able to make a debate on various issues: The question of free allocation of allowances; The issue of interaction with the HTA system; The question of interaction with the Trade Defense Instruments, etc.\n\nAs a trade union, a member of IndustriAll Europe, we are, of course, seeking to be involved in all this (- debate (s)).\n\nGabriel Smal\nSecretary-General \nACV-CSC METEA",

        "feedback": "Climate change is inextricably linked to economic inequality: it is a crisis that is driven by the greenhouse gas emissions of the ‘haves’ that hits the ‘have-nots’. Oxfam estimates of the scale of this inequality suggest that the poorest half of the global population – around 3.5 billion people – are responsible for only around 10% of total global emissions attributed to individual consumption. For years, developed countries have claimed they will not go beyond incremental targets to cut their emissions unless and until rapidly growing developing countries step up to cut their emissions too. While it is absolutely critical to any chance of averting the most dangerous impacts of climate change that all developing countries play their part too, it is worth remembering that the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries.\n- On Part C\nOverall, European Green Deal initiatives and legislation should undergo impact assessments and inter-service consultations to respect the ‘do no harm’ principle and policy coherence for sustainable development (PCSD). This is particularly important for the carbon border adjustment tax, which could impact domestic resources, exports and citizens in the Global South. \n- Likely social impacts\nIt is important to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalised by higher prices on essential products. Any environmental tax which is introduced must fit in a progressive tax mix. This means making sure that the polluter pays rather than further creating a burden on the poorest. When regressive effects of the tax are inevitable, compensation measures for the poorest should be introduced.  Ways of addressing this can include the provision of affordable alternatives and systems such as public transport as well as considering providing direct transfers to low-income households to mitigate the impact on their income.\n- Likely environmental impacts\nThe effectiveness of the instrument and alternatives should be carefully considered. Will a carbon border tax really discourage carbon leakage or greenhouse gas emissions in countries exporting to the EU? Or are there other better and more effective policy instruments that could be introduced, e.g. import standards regulations.\n\n- On Part D \n- Impact assessment\nImpact assessment should consider policy options to mitigate impacts on LDCs and the poorest. It is important to note that LDCs might lose exporting opportunities as a result of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which has repercussions among others on LDCs’ balance of payments. As such, the revenues collected from the CBAM should be earmarked for fairness purposes.  These earmarked revenues could (1) compensate the costs of climate-related losses and damages already being experienced by communities in the Global South, (2) finance adaptation measures and (3) fund investments to enable a just transition. In particular the revenues accumulated in the EU  via the CBAM, when imposed on products imported from developing countries, could be directed to the UN’s Green Climate Fund or a fund to stimulate different types of LDCs’ exports to the EU. When a CBAM applies to countries that are neither least developed countries nor developing countries, such as non-EU OECD countries, the proceeds could be used for redistribution in the EU to mitigate impacts on low-income households, or again to the UN’s Green Climate Fund. \n- Evidence base and data collection \nIt is important to consider additional sources of evidence related to impacts on developing countries and mitigating measures. \n- Consultation of citizens and stakeholders\nWe recommend consultation with CSOs on the impact that the measures can have on developing countries. We also suggest a longer period than 12 weeks for the public consultation to make consultation with CSOs meaningful. \n",
        "pdf_text": "OXFAM MEDIA BRIEFING\nEXTREME CARBON INEQUALITY\nWhy the Paris climate deal must put the poorest, lowest emitting and most vulnerable people first\nSUMMARY\nClimate change is inextricably linked to economic inequality: it is a crisis that is driven by the greenhouse gas emissions of the ‘haves’ that hits the ‘have-nots’ the hardest. In this briefing Oxfam demonstrates the extent of global carbon inequality by estimating and comparing the lifestyle consumption emissions of rich and poor citizens in different countries.\nStrikingly, our estimates of the scale of this inequality suggest that the poorest half of the global population — around 3.5 billion people — are responsible for only around 10% of total global emissions attributed to individual consumption, ' yet live overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change.\nAround 50% of these emissions meanwhile can be attributed to the richest 10% of people around the world, who have average carbon footprints 11 times as high as the poorest half of the population, and 60 times as high as the poorest 10%. The average footprint of the richest 1% of people globally could be 175 times that of the poorest 10%.\nWhile COP21 in Paris will see a deal negotiated between governments on the basis of the total emissions produced in their territories, the real winners and losers will be their citizens. The litmus test of the deal will be whether it delivers something for the poorest people who are both the least responsible for and the most vulnerable to climate change, wherever they live.\nOxfam’s new data analysis, which attributes estimated total lifestyle consumption emissions for different countries to the varying income groups within them (see Box 1 for definitions and methodology), not only shows the extreme nature of global carbon inequality, but also helps bust some of the myths that have circulated around the UN climate talks for years about who is driving climate change.\n2 DECEMBER 2015\nThe poorest half of the global population are responsible for only around 10% of global emissions yet live overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change — while the richest 10% of people in the world are responsible for around 50% of global emissions.\nThe average footprint of someone in the richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%.\nwww.oxfam.org\nOXFAM\nComparing the average lifestyle consumption footprints of richer and poorer citizens in a range of countries helps show that while some ‘emerging economies’ like China, India, Brazil and South Africa have high and rapidly rising emissions, the lifestyle consumption emissions of even their richest citizens remain some way behind that of their counterparts in rich OECD countries, even though this is changing and will continue to do so without urgent climate action. The lifestyle emissions of the hundreds of millions of their poorest citizens, meanwhile, remain significantly lower than even the poorest people in the OECD countries.\nWhile the richest citizens can and should contribute as individuals to cutting their own emissions through lifestyle changes, wherever they live, they cannot solve the climate crisis through voluntary action alone. Their choices are often constrained by the decisions of their governments in all sorts of areas, from energy to transport policy. Without question, a weak agreement in Paris is no more in their interests than it is in the interests of the poorest and least responsible. Increasingly members of the richest 10% are experiencing the impacts of climate change themselves, and are mobilizing to demand action from their governments.\nThe only beneficiaries of inadequate climate action in Paris and beyond are a much smaller elite with vested interests in the continuation of a high carbon and deeply unequal global economy. Between the Copenhagen and Paris climate conferences, the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with interests in fossil fuel activities has risen from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, while the size of their combined personal fortunes has expanded by around 50% from over $200bn to more than $300bn.? Governments in Paris need to stand up to their influence, and stand up for their citizens — the poorest, lowest emitting and most vulnerable among them first and foremost — if Paris is to deliver an agreement for those who need it most.\nBetween the Copenhagen and Paris climate conferences, the number of billionaires with interests in fossil fuel activities has risen from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015. Their combined personal fortunes have expanded by around 50% from over $200bn to more than $300bn.\n‘We see Oxfam's report and our recent paper \"Carbon and inequality: from Kyoto to Paris\" as two halves of the same walnut. The two studies converge towards one key fact: individual carbon emissions are highly unequally distributed throughout the world. Oxfam claims that any successful agreement at the Paris COP should take into account within- country carbon inequalities — and climate change impacts. We could not agree more. Our proposal to progressively tax carbon emissions in order to finance climate adaptation and Oxfam's call to secure a low-carbon developing space for the world's have-nots are highly complementary.’\nLucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty Co-authors, ‘Carbon and inequality from Kyoto to Paris,’ Paris School of Economics\n‘This timely report from Oxfam leaves no doubt that the test of an effective and climate just deal from Paris is the extent to which it protects the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. They are after all least responsible for and the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nThe report shows that women bear the heaviest burden in a warming world; they are particularly at risk due to gender inequalities, a reliance on climate sensitive livelihoods and a lack of assets to fall back on in harsh times. The recommendations of the report for the Paris Agreement, targeting increased finance for adaptation, attention to human rights and gender equality and the need to phase out fossil fuels while phasing in access to sustainable energy for all, are the measures against which to evaluate success.’\nMary Robinson President, Mary Robinson Foundation — Climate Justice\n1 Climate change and economic inequality are inextricably linked\nParis is a deal between governments, but the real winners and losers will be their citizens. In this briefing Oxfam uses new data analysis to estimate and compare the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of different countries, in order to demonstrate the scale of carbon inequality both globally and within key countries.\nThose with most at stake in Paris are the poorest 3.5 billion people on the planet, responsible for only around 10% of the total emissions from individual consumption, yet living overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In the dataset used to generate these estimates, individual consumption is responsible for 64% of global emissions, with the remaining 36% attributed to consumption by governments, investments (e.g. in infrastructure) and international transport. However, a recent paper by Chancel and Piketty finds very similar results attributing all national consumption emissions to individuals, * suggesting that our approach is a good proxy for attributing the shares of total global emissions. Figure 1 shows the distribution of global income from the richest to poorest 10% of people globally, and Oxfam’s estimate of their associated lifestyle consumption emissions as a share of the global total.\nFigure 1: Global income deciles and associated lifestyle consumption emissions\nPercentage of COz emissions by world population\nRichest\n10%\nichest 10% responsible for almost half of total lifestyle\nconsumption emissions\nPoorest 50%\nresponsible for\nonly around 10%\nof total lifestyle\nconsumption\nemissions\nSource: Oxfam\nWe conservatively estimate that the average emissions of a person in the poorest half of the global population are just 1.57 tCO2 — that equals 11 times less than the average footprint of someone in the richest 10%.* The average emissions of someone in the poorest 10% of the global population is 60 times less than that of someone in the richest 10%.\nWhile estimates at the extreme top and bottom of the global income distribution are more difficult to make, there is no question the gap is much wider still: the richest 1% may emit 30 times more than the poorest 50%, and 175 times more than the poorest 10%° (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Lifestyle consumption emissions per capita from different global income levels®\n60\n50\nle\n40\n30\n20\n10\n1% Richest 10% Richest40% Poorest 10% Poorest Global\nAverage\nSource: Oxfam\nThe average emissions of someone in the poorest 10% of the world population is 60 times less than that of someone in the richest 10%.\nA recent World Bank Study found that in the 52 countries analysed, most people live in countries where poor people are more exposed to droughts, floods and heat waves than the average of the population as a whole.\nWhat is more, the poorest half of people on the planet live overwhelmingly in countries that are considered the most vulnerable to climate change.\nFigure 3: Examples of where in the world people in the poorest half of global population live, and the scale of their lifestyle consumption emissions footprints’\n- »\n~~\n‘Ss\n~~\naa\n,.\nae Least vulnerable\nWomen bear the heaviest burden ina warming world, generally more heavily dependent on climate- sensitive livelihoods and with least to fall back on in harsh times.\nMost vulnerable | | | | |\nSource: Oxfam; Centre for Global Development Climate Change Vulnerability Index\n\nThe poorest people on the planet are not only least responsible for causing climate change, they also tend to be the most vulnerable to its consequences and least prepared to cope. But such inequalities are horizontal as well as vertical — with women facing greater risks than men, rural communities often more exposed than urban ones and groups marginalized because of race, ethnicity or other factors likely to be disproportionately affected.\nA recent study by the World Bank found that in the 52 countries analysed, most people live in countries where poor people (defined as the poorest 20% of the national population) are more exposed to disasters like droughts, floods and heat waves than the average of the population as a whole — and significantly so in many countries in Africa and South East Asia.°\nWomen often bear the heaviest burden of all in a warming world.® They are generally more heavily dependent on climate-sensitive livelihoods (such as rain-fed agriculture, and collecting water for household use), and they often have the least to fall back on in harsh times or to help them escape a downward spiral in productivity (such as access to land, training or capital).\nSuch inequalities can be seen in rich countries too. The poorest residents in the Gulf states of the USA — Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama — are exposed to a disproportionate threat from coastal flooding as a result of rising sea levels.'° When Superstorm Sandy hit New York in 2012, 33% of individuals in the storm surge area lived in government-assisted housing, with half of the 40,000 public housing residents of the city displaced. \"'\nNot only are richer countries and the richer communities within them less affected by climate change, they also tend to be far better prepared to cope with it.'* In California, USA, irrigation covers over 80% of arable land, while in Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad it is less than 1%. While 91% of farmers in the US have crop insurance to cover losses in the event of extreme weather, only 15% of farmers in India are covered, 10% in China and just 1% or less in Malawi and most low-income countries.\nWhat is clear is that climate change and economic inequality are inextricably linked. It is a crisis driven by the ‘haves’, which hits the ‘have- nots’ the hardest. If there is to be any justice in the deal in Paris, governments must deliver something for the have-nots, wherever they live.\nBox 2: Estimating the distribution of lifestyle consumption emissions\nA technical summary of the methodology behind the estimates presented in this briefing is available at http://oxf.am/Ze4e. The approach adopted assumes an elastic relationship between income and emissions. Put simply, it takes data on income shares of different percentiles at the national level and distributes aggregate national emissions to those percentiles.\nIt draws on two datasets: national income distribution data from analysis by Branko Milanovic based on household surveys for 118 countries in the benchmark year 2008; and estimates of CO, emissions associated with household consumption (which we here term ‘lifestyle consumption emissions’) from Glen Peters based on a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) trade model, covering 121 countries, for the year 2007.\nCritically, the CO. model represents emissions from consumption rather than production. The underlying trade model allocates emissions associated with goods/services to the territory in which consumption takes place rather than the country in which the production occurs. This gives a more realistic picture of the actual emissions of citizens of different levels of income within a country. Emissions associated with consumption by governments, capital and international transport are therefore excluded. The proportion of total consumption emissions attributed to the lifestyle consumption of individuals varies by country, but globally accounts for around 64% of the total.\nOxfam’s estimates should only be considered indicative of the orders of magnitude, but also as conservative, for two reasons. Firstly a significant number of mostly low-income countries are missing from the datasets; if they were included it would lower the average per capita emissions of the bottom 50% poorest people, and lower the share of the global total attributed to the bottom 50%. Secondly, we have assumed a nationally determined threshold of minimum emissions, raising the lower end of the distributions that may otherwise produce emissions values lower than might be considered plausible. See the technical note for a description of the approach taken and rationale.\nWhile 91% of farmers in the US have crop insurance to cover losses in the event of extreme weather, only 15% of farmers in India are covered, 10% in China and just 1% or less in Malawi and most low-income countries.\nClearly there will have been some changes to the income and associated emissions distributions since the benchmark year for the data of 2008; however the orders of magnitude presented here — notably the difference between the richest and poorest people globally — are likely still to hold. There will likely be a smaller but still very significant share of the global poorest 40% in some middle-income countries like China and Brazil, where growth has been fastest and relatively more inclusive, and a growing representation of some middle-income countries in the global richest 10% (see section 2).\n2 Lifestyle consumption emissions are highly unequal within and between countries\nThese new estimates can also help to dispel some of the myths that have long circulated around the UN climate change talks about who is responsible for driving climate change.\nFor years, developed countries have claimed they won’t go beyond incremental targets to cut their emissions unless and until rapidly growing developing countries step up to cut their emissions too. '? While it is absolutely critical to any chance of averting the most dangerous impacts of climate change that all developing countries play their part too, it is worth remembering that the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries, and that there are significant differences in the consumption footprints of rich and poor citizens among those countries too. That is, it makes little sense to treat them as though they are a single bloc (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Per capita lifestyle consumption emissions in G20 countries for which data is available\nTop 10% = Bottom 50% HBottom 40% Average\nUSA\n|\nCAN\nLe\nGBR\nDEU\nITA\nRUS\nFRA\nJPN\nKOR\nZAF\nMEX\nTUR\nARG\nCHN\nBRA\nIDN\nIND\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nHousehold CO, per capita (tonnes)\nThe lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries.\nThe vast majority of the world’s richest 10% high emitters still live in rich OECD countries, although that is slowly changing.\n50\nThe majority of the world's richest 10% high emitters still live in OECD countries; around a third are from the US. While the total emissions produced in China divided on a per capita basis have now surpassed those of the European Union, “ the per capita lifestyle consumption emissions of even the richest 10% of Chinese citizens are still likely to be considerably lower than the richest of their OECD counterparts. '° This is because such a large share of China’s emissions is from the production of goods consumed in rich countries.\nAs recently as 2008 (when the latest publically available data used in these estimates was produced) the average emissions of a person in the richest 10% of Chinese citizens was about the same as the average carbon footprint of someone in the poorest 40% of Europeans. Even allowing for the rapid growth in the size of China’s economy since then, this is unlikely to have changed dramatically yet, given the sheer scale of the Chinese population.\nWith regard to India the differences are even starker. Oxfam’s estimates suggest that even the richest 10% of Indian citizens have per capita emissions just one-quarter of the poorest 50% of those from the US, while the poorest 50% of Indians have a carbon footprint that is just one- twentieth of the poorest 50% in the US.\nEven in absolute terms, the sheer scale of the gap between the responsibilities of the richest compared with the poorest is compelling (see Figure 3). While the huge populations of countries like China and India clearly contribute significantly to the global total of emissions from lifestyle consumption — again reinforcing the need for strong climate action in those countries — the poorest half of the Chinese population (over 600m people) have a total emissions footprint that is still only one- third that of the richest 10% of US citizens (around 30m people). The poorest half of the Indian population (around 600m people) emits only half as much again, about the same as the richest 10% of people in Japan (around 12m people).\nThe average emissions of the richest 10% of Indians is just one- quarter of the poorest half of the US population, while average emissions of the poorest half of the Indian population is just one-twentieth that of even the poorest half of the population in the\nThe poorest half of the Chinese population (over 600m people) have a total emissions footprint that is only one-third that of the richest 10% of US citizens (around 30m people).\nFigure 5: Total lifestyle consumption emissions in G20 countries for which data is available\nm= Top 10% = Bottom 50% mBottom 40%\nUSA Sg\nCAN\nGBR\nDEU\nITA\nRUS\nFRA\nJPN\nKOR\nZAF\nMEX eee\"\nTUR\nARG\nCHN\nBRA\nIDN\nIND\n200\n400\n600\n1,200\nTotal Household CO, (million tonnes)\nHowever what is also clear from the data in Figure 2 is that rapidly growing ‘emerging’ economies like China, India, Brazil and South Africa, while showing significant diversity in the income and emissions distributions of their populations, all have highly unequal economies with correspondingly highly unequal emissions footprints between their citizens. ©\nThe gap between the richest 10% and poorest half of the population is greater in South Africa and Brazil than in any other country in the G20. In South Africa, the richest 10% of citizens already have per capita lifestyle consumption footprints ten times that of the poorest half of the population. In Brazil, one of the few G20 countries to actually start to reduce shockingly high levels of inequality in recent years,’ their footprint is eight times as high.\nThe estimates presented here are based on the latest publically available datasets from around 2007/8, and in the period since then both the income and emissions of the richest citizens in these countries will have increased (although the sheer scale of the populations of countries like China and India means the orders of magnitude are unlikely to have shifted dramatically yet). Without ambitious action to tackle inequality and drive down emissions in these countries, not only will it be increasingly difficult to eliminate extreme poverty*® but also impossible to limit global warming below the 1.5C threshold that more than 100 countries have called for.\n1,600\nThe poorest half of the Indian population (around 600m people) has a total emissions footprint about the same as the richest 10% of citizens in Japan (around 12m people).\nIn South Africa, the richest 10% of citizens already have average lifestyle consumption footprints ten times higher than the poorest half of the population. In Brazil it is eight times as high.\n800\n1,000\n1,400\n3 Vested interests in a high carbon and deeply unequal global economy are holding us back\nWhile the richest citizens can and should contribute as individuals to cutting their own emissions through lifestyle changes, wherever they live, it would be wrong to conclude that they are solely responsible for solving the climate crisis, not least because their choices are often constrained by the decisions of their governments and the market forces they shape. Equally it would be wrong to conclude that a weak agreement in Paris is remotely in their interests.\nSuperstorm Sandy, Hurricane Katrina, the US droughts of 2010 and 2012, the on-going California drought: these are events that are directly impacting the lives and bank balances of the richest group of citizens in the world. In Europe, heat waves and flooding have taken thousands of lives and cost millions in damages. In Australia, wildfires put thousands of properties at risk each year. And even those who have not yet found themselves directly in harm’s way can increasingly feel the indirect consequences in their own lives linked to instability abroad, as food prices rise or people are forced to leave their homes.\nIncreasingly, the richest citizens recognize it too. Tens of thousands of members of the global top 10% joined the massed ranks of 400,000 people in the biggest march for action on climate change in New York last year. Unprecedented numbers are taking action ahead of the adoption of a new global climate agreement in Paris. From Australia to Canada, they are signing petitions, re-thinking their consumer choices, and increasingly voting for alternatives.\nThe only beneficiaries of inadequate climate action in Paris and beyond are members of a much smaller elite with vested interests in the continuation of a high-carbon and deeply unequal global economy. It is this group that governments in Paris must stand up to on behalf of their citizens; the poorest, least responsible and most vulnerable first and foremost.\nA weak agreement in Paris is not remotely in the interests of rich high emitters. The only beneficiaries of inadequate climate action are a much smaller elite with vested interests in the continuation of a high carbon and deeply unequal global economy.\n10\nBox 3: Global fossil fuel giants, mega profits, and the carbon baron billionaires who front these companies\nMultinational fossil fuel companies are some of the most profitable on earth — and behind the well-known brands is a club of carbon billionaires. These are the mega rich super-elite who have made their wealth from the business of driving climate change — for which the poorest and most vulnerable pay the highest price.\nBetween the Copenhagen and Paris climate conferences, the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with interests in fossil fuel activities has risen from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015. Over these five years, the size of their combined personal fortunes has expanded from over $200bn to over $300bn. '°\nThe fossil fuel industry has a lot to lose from ambitious climate regulation — and so it is not surprising that the sector spends millions of dollars every year lobbying to try to influence and delay government action — buying more years to pollute and protect their profits.\nFossil fuel interests declare spending €44m a year on lobbying the EU in Brussels — around €120,000 a day. In the US in 2013, the oil, gas and coal industries spent almost $157m on lobbying — over $430,000 per day, or $24,000 per hour. By comparison, the entire alternative energy sector spent the same amount on lobbying in one year as just the top two spending oil giants, according to the Overseas Development Institute and Oil Change International. As these are self-reported figures in Washington DC and Brussels alone, they are clearly just the tip of the iceberg.~°\nAll this investment clearly buys results. One clue is in the subsidies and tax breaks awarded to the fossil fuel sector, which as the OECD shows far outweighs support to the renewables sector. The US government provides $5.1bn each year in tax deductions for exploration. In each annual budget, President Obama has attempted to repeal some of the most egregious tax breaks, but has been blocked by Congress — many of whose members rely on campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry. The US is now the world’s largest producer of both oil and gas, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.”\nThe fossil fuel industry declares spending €44m a year on lobbying the EU in Brussels — around €120,000 a day.

This means the agreement must meet the following four litmus tests as a minimum:\n1. Does it deliver fair emissions reductions that will keep open the chance of limiting warming below 1.5C?\ne Does it include a ratchet mechanism that ensures the inadequate emissions cuts pledged by countries (INDCs) are increased fairly and adequately by 2020, and every five years thereafter? Does it include a long-term global mitigation goal to see fossil fuel emissions fairly phased out and 100% sustainable renewable energy — with universal access — phased in by early in the second half of the century, with developed countries leading the way and providing the support that developing countries require to do the same?\nDoes it deliver a major increase in adaptation finance?\nDoes it include a dedicated collective adaptation finance target that will see at least 50% of public climate finance (or at least $35bn per year) dedicated to adaptation by 2020 as part of a clear roadmap to meet the commitment to mobilize $100bn per year? Does it include new separate climate finance targets for both adaptation and mitigation in the post-2020 agreement set on five yearly cycles, with the level of the adaptation target set commensurate with the level of global mitigation ambition? Does it include a commitment to a major increase in resources for the Green Climate Fund during its first replenishment from 2017, and immediately for the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund to ensure a fast-tracking of adaptation resources for those countries, communities and especially women that need them most? Does it include a commitment to establish new innovative sources of adaptation finance to halt the stretching of Overseas Development Assistance budgets, such as earmarking of revenues from the European Financial Transaction Tax, and commitments to ensure that carbon pricing schemes direct revenues from high polluters to those least responsible and worst affected by climate change, such as through an automatic set-aside of emissions allowances in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for the Green Climate Fund?\n3 Does it recognize the need to address loss and damage from the impacts of climate change to which it is not possible to adapt as a formal part of the new regime, distinct from adaptation?\n4. Does it recognize the need to respect the principles of human rights, gender equality and the need for a just transition for workers in the implementation of climate policies at the core of the agreement?\n12\nNOTES\n1 The emissions estimates presented in this paper refer to emissions from individual consumption rather than national production, based on the estimates of national consumption emissions provided by Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo. In total, individual consumption makes up 64% of global emissions in the Peters dataset, with the remaining 36% attributed to government consumption, investments (in infrastructure etc) and international transport. A similar study by Chancel and Piketty uses the same dataset but assumes that government consumption and investments can also be attributed to individuals as the ultimate beneficiaries, and finds very similar results. Therefore while Oxfam’s estimates strictly relate to the shares of total global emissions associated with individual consumption, they are also sound proxies for the shares of all global emissions. 2 Forbes, Billionaires list, available in real time at http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/#tab:overall Annual data taken from list published in March of each year. Billionaires were coded as having business interests or activities in the fossil fuel sector if the description of the source of wealth was interpreted to be related to the fossil fuel sector. In some cases the source of wealth is explicitly listed as ‘oil’, ‘coal’, or ‘gas’, or upstream/downstream sectors like ‘oil refining’, or ‘pipelines’. In others the company name, such as Lukoil, a Russian oil company is given. Some billionaires have interests in more than one sector, including fossil fuels. These are not the same individuals over time; some billionaires may enter or exit this elite group from year to year. Values given in ‘Money of the Day’ for each year, based on current exchange rates against the US$. Amounts have been adjusted for inflation. L. Chancel and T. Piketty (2015) ‘Carbon and Inequality from Kyoto to Paris: Trends in the global inequality of carbon emissions (1998-2013) and prospects for an equitable adaptation fund’, http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/ChancelPiketty2015.pdf Global total household consumption emissions in 2007 were 17,187,821,112 tCO2. The top 10% richest people globally have per capita emissions of 17.60 tCOz and total emissions of 8,431,448,890 tCOz, while the bottom 50% poorest people globally have per capita emissions of 1.57 tCOz and total emissions of 1,791,265,686 tCO2. The average per capita emissions of the top 10% are therefore around 11 times higher than the average emissions of the poorest 50%, and the total emissions of the top 10% are nearly 5 times higher than the total emissions of the poorest 50%. See technical briefing for full methodological explanation and findings. Since we do not consider our approach sufficiently robust at the decile level, we have estimated the lifestyle consumption emissions of the richest 1% on the basis of the richest 10% of citizens in the US, which make up around half the global 1%. See note 5. The climate vulnerability map is reproduced from Wheeler, David (2011) ‘Quantifying Vulnerability to Climate Change: Implications for adaptation finance’ http://www.cgdev.org/page/mapping-impacts-climate-change. Given the countries missing from Oxfam’s income/emissions model, the population size per country of the global bottom 50% is estimated as those living below $4.40/day in 2012 in 2011 PPP, based on World Bank data which shows approximately 50% of population in developing countries live below this income level — based mainly on consumption data. The $4.40/day in 2011 PPP is approximately $2.80 in 2005 PPP, or $1022/year. The lower limit of the range of emissions on the map is based on the estimated emissions of the bottom 10% poorest in that country. The upper limit is based on identifying the percentile of each country's population that has the highest income from the world income distribution in 2008 (2005 PPP) that is still below $1022/year and reporting the estimated emissions per capita of that group. The map and these calculations are intended purely for illustrative purposes of the types of countries where the world’s poorest 40% live, and the scale of their emissions footprints. 8 S.

Although there are some differences to our respective methodologies, Chancel and Piketty estimate that 10% of the top 10% highest emitters are from China. This would mean around 5% of the Chinese population is amongst the top 10% highest emitters globally (compared to approximately 70% of US citizens), meaning that the top 10% highest emitters in China are very likely significantly lower than the top 10% in OECD countries (note that the Chancel and Piketty study represents its findings in terms of the top 10% highest emitters, while in this paper we look at the top 10% richest people, although there is significant overlap in our findings).\n16 The highest proportion of the world’s poorest people now live in Middle Income Countries, see http://www.cgdev.org/files/1424922_file_Sumner_brief_MIC_poor_FINAL.pdf\n17 See for example: http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/for-richer-or-poorer-the-capture- of-growth-and-politics-in-emerging-economies-578757\n18 See for example: https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/cr-even-it- up-extreme-inequality-291014-en.pdf\n19 Forbes Billionaires List, op cit.\n20 H.

        "feedback": "1. Solvay welcomes the EU intent to safeguard the competitiveness of EU industries. The EU wants to become the first continent carbon neutral in 2050 which involves a deep turnaround of all the sectors of the EU economy. New climate constraints will nevertheless mean a more severe greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) reduction path with an increased risk of carbon leakage as underlined by the Commission. In this respect, Solvay welcomes the explicit recognition of the need to safeguard the international competitiveness of EU industries in light of asymmetric increasing climate ambitions in EU compared to the rest of the world. However, considering the recent Communication of the EU Green Deal, we believe that an impact assessment is needed on the different options envisaged to create a carbon border adjustment mechanism that would fulfil this objective.\n2. A carbon border adjustment mechanism must come in addition to the ETS carbon leakage measures not as an alternative\nThe EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) has been reinvigorated for the next period 2021-2030 with tighter mechanisms leading to fewer emissions and a stronger market price although with a reduced support to international competitiveness through shrinking free allocations. Considering those shrinking allocations, driven notably by lowered benchmarks, we will no longer be able to rely only on them to face the rising asymmetric situation for emissions costs between domestic production and manufacturing outside EU.\nAs the objective is to safeguard EU competitiveness, a carbon border adjustment mechanism should come as an additional complement to the ETS carbon leakage measures for chemicals and their value chains. Unfortunately and somewhat confusingly, the Green Deal is only considering such a carbon border mechanism as an „alternative“ to the ETS carbon leakage measures (see European Green Deal 11.12.2019 COM(2019) 640 final- page 5 para 4) which would then weaken the industry competitiveness. Chemicals are intricated in complex value chains with multiple stages each exposed to international competition and for which weighting carbon content is beyond feasibility. Removing the existing ETS carbon leakage measures would increase the chemicals costs as well as the value chain costs at stages for which a carbon border adjustment mechanism is also not feasible. This mechanism, if introduced as an “alternative” to ETS, would thereby fail to safeguard the international competitiveness of chemicals and its whole EU value chain.\n3. Imported emissions should be captured in Europe’s efforts to mitigate GHG: under ETS, we are facing a decreasing cap of emissions coupled with a price to pay if emitting GHGs beyond a certain theoretical benchmark level, the aim being to drive down our emissions. Imports are nevertheless not submitted to ETS and therefore are gaining an increasing competitive advantage particularly when facing lower or even non-existent domestic price for their emissions. Therefore a carbon border adjustment mechanism, if introduced as a complement to the ETS carbon leakage measures, would then become a welcome tool to safeguard competitiveness for the part above benchmark that the current ETS carbon leakage measures are not providing. Such a mechanism, as described just here above, would also help motivating third countries to implement similar ambitious climate policy as in the EU. Policy makers must indeed ensure to level the playing field with other economies that do not comply nor pay for their emissions the way the EU does. \n4. EU exports competitiveness must be ensured:As for the whole European chemical industry, Solvay relies also on its exports to keep production production in the EU. In this regard, keeping the ETS free allocations based on genuine benchmarks are vital in particular to safeguard the production of soda ash in Europe. Any new additional carbon border mechanism or ETS measures should therefore safeguard or even improve our ability to compete.",

Considering those shrinking allocations, driven notably by lowered benchmarks, we will no longer be able to rely only on them to face the rising asymmetric situation for emissions costs between domestic production and manufacturing outside EU.\nAs the objective is to safeguard EU competitiveness, a carbon border adjustment mechanism should come as an additional complement to the ETS carbon leakage measures for chemicals and their value chains.\nUnfortunately and somewhat confusingly, the Green Deal is only considering such a carbon border mechanism as an ,,alternative“ to the ETS carbon leakage measures (see European Green Deal 11.12.2019 COM(2019) 640 final- page 5 para 4) which would then weaken the industry competitiveness. Chemicals are intricated in complex value chains with multiple stages each exposed to international competition and for which weighting carbon content is beyond feasibility. Removing the existing ETS carbon leakage measures would increase the chemicals costs as well as the value chain costs at stages for which a carbon border adjustment mechanism is also not feasible. This mechanism, if introduced as an “alternative” to ETS, would thereby fail to safeguard the international competitiveness of chemicals and its whole EU value chain.\nSOLVAY S.A. - Rue de Ransbeek, 310 - 1120 Brussels - Belgium - T : +32 2 264 21 11 - F : +32 2 264 30 61 T.V.A.

Imported emissions should be captured in Europe’s efforts to mitigate GHG\nUnder ETS, we are facing a decreasing cap of emissions coupled with a price to pay if emitting GHGs beyond a certain theoretical benchmark level, the aim being to drive down our emissions. Imports are nevertheless not submitted to ETS and therefore are gaining an increasing competitive advantage particularly when facing lower or even non-existent domestic price for their emissions.\nTherefore a carbon border adjustment mechanism, if introduced as a complement to the ETS carbon leakage measures, would then become a welcome tool to safeguard competitiveness for the part above benchmark that the current ETS carbon leakage measures are not providing. Such a mechanism, as described just here above, would also help motivating third countries to implement similar ambitious climate policy as in the EU. Policy makers must indeed ensure to level the playing field with other economies that do not comply nor pay for their emissions the way the EU does.\n4. EU exports competitiveness must be ensured\nAs for the whole European chemical industry, Solvay relies also on its exports to keep production in the EU. In this regard, keeping the ETS free allocations based on genuine benchmarks are vital in particular to safeguard the production of soda ash in Europe. Any new additional carbon border mechanism and/or ETS measures should therefore safeguard or even improve our ability to compete at export.\nSOLVAY S.A. - Rue de Ransbeek, 310 - 1120 Brussels - Belgium - T : +32 2 264 21 11 - F : +32 2 264 30 61\nT.V.A.

Given the reach of our business and our brands, PepsiCo recognises the important role we can, and must, play in engaging and mobilising our supply chain to transition to climate neutrality.\nIn the spirit of providing constructive input, this note lists several elements we hope will be considered as and when any carbon border adjustment mechanism is developed.\n1. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EUROPEAN BUSINESS\nPepsiCo supports the introduction of a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism to address carbon leakage that may occur through imports. We believe a well-designed and evidence-based CBA mechanism could level the economic playing field, ensure the competitiveness of European based companies that are more carbon-efficient than competitors abroad, and encourage low-carbon economic production within Europe and its trading partners.\nThe CBA mechanism needs to identify carbon leakage risks not only for existing production facilities and operations within the European market but also with respect to new capacity expansion and economic growth, therefore preserving Europe’s attractiveness for both domestic and foreign investment.\n2. STRENGTHEN EUROPE’S GLOBAL ROLE IN CLIMATE ACTION\nEurope’s climate neutrality goal confirms the leading role Europe is playing on climate action. The introduction of a CBA mechanism would be a strong tool for the EU to strengthen its global leadership role\nS PEPSICO\nand encourage trading partners towards higher and aligned climate ambitions. A CBA could, for example, boost innovation into less carbon-intensive and more sustainable products within and outside the EU.\n3. CBAAS PART OF THE BROADER TRADE SYSTEM\nPepsiCo believes the CBA mechanism should be fully aligned to existing WTO guidelines to avoid potential obstruction of global trade. As CBAs develop over time, the European Commission may need to consider the establishment of a Carbon Custom Union with trading partners that have similar carbon reduction ambitions, encouraging those economies to harmonise their carbon pricing policies and therefore obviating the need for CBAs between them, allowing for frictionless trade internally and a common CBA externally.\nThe CBA should also be complemented by bilateral trade measures with EU trading partners that support the EU climate neutrality goal. In particular, PepsiCo believes that bilateral trade agreements with third countries should have measures to encourage less carbon-intensive products before applying a CBA mechanism.\nBroader alignment with the existing trade system should factor in the way the CBA mechanism would apply to countries that already have a carbon policy in place, and therefore find a balance between securing equal treatment to all trading partners according to WTO guidelines, while also avoiding double taxation of products.\n4. DESIGNING A TRANSPARENT AND FEASIBLE CBA IMECHANISM\nPepsiCo supports the effort led by the Commission to fully assess the potential impact the CBA mechanism would have on the European economy, environment and society. A CBA mechanism is a necessity to deliver on any ambitious climate policy but we are aware of the difficulties in combining such mechanism with the existing cap and trade scheme, which focuses on facilities as opposed to goods, thus presenting significant complexity in matching EU carbon pricing to the carbon intensity of imported goods. The European Commission will also need to present a transparent mechanism with respect to the basis for calculation, measurement of emissions, revenues, penalties for non-compliance and other critical design issues.\nThe CBA mechanism should be designed in a transparent, science-based and collaborative way while also maintaining confidential business information through supportive regulations.\nWe ask that when defining the sectors that would be impacted by the CBA mechanism, the Commission prioritises alignment between those covered by the ETS within the EU and those that will be covered externally so to ensure a fair and competitive level playing field and a uniform carbon pricing."

        "feedback": "The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) supports the concept of fully integrating the external environmental cost of products and consumption, including for goods that are imported to the EU. This is not being done in a satisfactory way today and in many EU countries, including Sweden, emissions per capita are higher than perceived if consumption-based emissions are accounted for. Further, SSNC fully supports that economic policy instruments in the EU should favour ambitious climate action and increase costs for environmentally damaging activities regardless of where they occur. \n\nA Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) has the ability to address both of these issues. If designed correctly, it could address the consumption-based emissions embedded in consumption goods being imported to the EU, while at the same time allowing for an appropriate and higher carbon pricing within the EU. Therefore, SSNC is positive towards the European Commission exploring if and how a CBA can be implemented. SSNC holds that a policy tool like CBA likely will be necessary to deliver on the EUs long-term climate goals.   \n\nSSNC would like to give the following recommendations to the European Commission regarding the development of a CBA:\n\n-\tSupporting a CBA does not imply that SSNC agrees with the notion that the EU industry suffers from carbon leakage, as this is still largely unproven. In this regard, a CBA will need to be complemented by a total phaseout of all free allowances that are currently being distributed to high emitting industries under the EU ETS, taking effect immediately. This must not be compromised. Giving out free allowances goes against the Polluter Pays Principle, and a CBA is therefore a better policy instrument to prevent possible carbon leakage, while allowing for a higher carbon price. \n-\tIdeally, the sectoral or product scope of the CBA should be as wide as possible to strengthen the environmental justification of the measure and for the tool to be able to address consumption-based emissions. SSNC recognizes, however, that applying a wide scope initially might increase administrative burden. For the sake of not delaying implementation, SSNC therefore supports that the Commission assess pros and cons of different sectoral or product scopes and, if necessary, make a proposal for a gradual inclusion of sectors starting with 1) carbon-intensive basic goods (e.g., cement, steel) and deforestation risk commodities; 2) industrially processed goods; and 3) others. \n-\tTo assist the implementation of a CBA, all industries and medium-large companies should start accounting for emissions from the whole value chain, including Scope 3, and the Commission should offer support in this regard.\n-\tThe sole objective of the CBA must be fighting climate change, and the CBA must not be used as a protectionist measure for EU industry. In this regard, the CBA should apply to imports only, and not also benefit exports. \n-\tTo avoid that the CBA result in negative equity impacts, it should be possible to grant exemptions for products (excluding hydrocarbons) from Least Developed Countries and countries responsible for a de minimis level of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n-\tRevenues from the CBA should be earmarked to further climate action in the EU or to assist affected lower-income countries to cut back on the carbon intensity of their economies.  \n\nNo measure known as a CBA has ever been implemented fully anywhere in the world. Putting in place a CBA is therefore likely going to be a big challenge, from a methodological and possibly legal point of view but also in terms of convincing trade partners of the usefulness and justification of the measure. In this regard, SSNC would like to stress that any reform or adoption of other policy measures, including adopting a new and revised 2030 climate target, must by no means be delayed while a CBA is being developed and negotiated.

In this context of crisis, Europe’s industrial strategy should be completely redefined. Climate, energy and industry policies should converge in a coherent way, ensuring security of supply for European citizens and a solid and pragmatic path towards carbon neutrality.\n\nUNIDEN welcomes the recognition by the European Union of the need to safeguard the competitiveness of industry in Europe in a context of increasing the Union’s climate ambition. \n\nThe objective of carbon neutrality proposed by the new European Commission will lead to profound changes in our behaviour to decarbonise our consumption patterns. This will therefore lead all European industry sectors to accompany this transition by investing heavily in decarbonising their production and at the same time offering low-carbon solutions to their customers.\n\nIn order to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the European Union and not just relocate our production to countries less concerned with their impact on the climate, it will be necessary to be able to finance these investments while maintaining the competitiveness of our means of production. This will be all the more difficult given that, with the Coronavirus pandemic, industry is heavily affected and their investment capacity is severely reduced or even non-existent.\n\nUNIDEN welcomes the explicit recognition of the need to put in place measures to preserve the competitiveness of European industry in order to combat climate change more effectively without transferring emissions from our consumption patterns to other countries. \n\nIn order to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, i.e. an increase in imports of products with a high carbon footprint to the detriment of low-carbon European production, UNIDEN considers that the introduction of a carbon inclusion mechanism at the borders of the European Union could — subject to appropriate arrangements and following an impact assessment — be able to preserve the competitiveness of European industry vis-à-vis industry located in regions or countries where the carbon constraint is much lower or even non-existent. \n\nHowever, such a mechanism will have to meet a number of conditions, and in particular must not jeopardise existing carbon leakage prevention schemes, in particular for energy-intensive companies; it will also have to be linked with appropriate measures to preserve the competitiveness of the downstream sectors.

In order to preserve international competitiveness, international cooperation and existing trading-regimes, any new established mechanism, e. g. a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, should be carefully considered. Necessary discussions to define such a system should be based on a holistic and carefully performed impact assessment. A complete package must focus on these main criteria: \n\n•\tThe VDA supports a multilateral, rule-based framework for international trade and investment. All potential measures being adapted  to avoid carbon and investment leakage have to ensure compliance with WTO rules and EU's international trade agreements.\n\n•\tPotential effects on the international trading system must be considered. This includes, for example, negative counter-reactions by affected states, regardless of whether the EU has de jure found a WTO-compliant measure. Any form of discrimination or unilateral preference must be prevented.\n\n•\tFurthermore, it has to be considered that according to the concept of the European Commission exports from the EU would not be unburdened from higher costs due to EU-climate policies.

Achievement of ambitious climate targets requires to avoid any carbon leakage due to different national or regional climate regulations. In order to preserve international competitiveness, international cooperation and existing trading-regimes, any new established mechanism, e. g. a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, should be carefully considered. Necessary discussions to define such a system should be based on a holistic and carefully performed impact assessment. A complete package must focus on these main criteria:\nThe VDA supports a multilateral, rule-based framework for international trade and investment. All potential measures being adapted to avoid carbon and investment leakage have to ensure compliance with WTO rules and EU's international trade agreements. Potential effects on the international trading system must be considered. This includes, for example, negative counter-reactions by affected states, regardless of whether the EU has de jure found a WTO-compliant measure. Any form of discrimination or unilateral preference must be prevented. Furthermore, it has to be considered that according to the concept of the European Commission exports from the EU would not be unburdened from higher costs due to EU-climate policies. This has a negative impact on competitiveness of European industries. A convincing concept of how a new mechanism - for instance a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - could be implemented in practice is not finally developed yet.

        "pdf_text": "WK (Of\nWIRTSCHAFTSKAMMER OSTERREICH\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nInception Impact Assessment by the European Commission\nWKO Statement\nThe Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (Wirtschaftskammer Osterreich, WKO)' supports the goal of the European Climate Policy to attain climate neutrality by 2050. Given the massive negative repercussions of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the European population, business and industry, all relevant considerations, measures and instruments - including preparations for a possible Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - must focus primarily and unequivocally on providing the best possible support to companies to achieve the necessary recovery and the transformation towards a low-carbon economy and must strictly avoid unilateral steps to tighten up European framework conditions in ways that could weaken our companies’ international competitiveness.\nStricter EU greenhouse gas reduction goals will, in any event, lead to even higher costs for European enterprises. At present, it is completely unclear how leeway and prospects for investments to drive the recovery and safeguard the future of company sites are supposed to exist in light of this development and without an international level playing field. However, these investments are a fundamental prerequisite for the dynamic innovation and growth that policymakers and all of us are hoping the European economy will soon be able to exhibit again.\nWKO therefore suggests the following ranking of priorities in further considerations regarding a CBAM:\ne The main goal for the EU must be to create a level playing field pursuant to standardized carbon pricing at international level. This goal always has to be top of mind in the preparations for a CBAM. As long as the requirements for a level playing field are not in place, it is absolutely mandatory to retain comprehensive and complete protection against carbon leakage (direct and indirect) within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) at least until the end of phase four in 2030 and to expand that protection if need be. In parallel with and supplementary to these efforts plausibility checks, considerations and preparations can be initiated in individual ETS sectors on the possible implementation of a temporary CBAM. Absolutely imperative prerequisites for this step are comprehensive impact assessments in the individual sectors, with due account taken of the possible repercussions that a CBAM could have on the entire value chain and on the competitiveness of the individual sectors, which varies widely in some cases.\n1 https: //www.wko. at/service/Austrian-Economic-Chambers.html (English version)\ne A CBAM must not endanger an effective common EU trade policy, towards its trading partners, within ongoing and future EU trade agreements or EU efforts within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international conferences or organizations. In any case, steps have to be taken to ensure that a future CBAM is designed to be WTO-compliant. e The entire process must proceed in close consultation with the affected sectors and include considerations about the type and amount of financial cost compensation in line with validated and internationally applicable reference values as well as effective and transparent monitoring, verification and reporting.\nQuestions and concerns regarding a CBAM\ne There is a real danger that the introduction and administration of a CBAM would pose an overwhelming additional administrative, personnel and financial burden on internationally active companies in the EU. This would run counter to the many years of EU efforts to promote international trade relations and to support companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in conducting international trade. A CBAM must not become a bureaucratic monster that saddles EU companies with extensive obligations to furnish documentation and evidence, etc. in cross-border deliveries within the EU as well as in global value chains. Before a possible introduction of a CBAM for selected, highly exposed sectors, a comprehensive impact assessment has to be conducted for each sector individually to determine possible legal, trade and economic policy repercussions. An impact assessment of this kind must also address the interconnections within the value chains in each sector and evaluate the effects of a CBAM on them. The results of this impact assessment will determine whether the introduction of a CBAM is necessary and if so, how it can be implemented in a proportionate, carefully targeted, and practical way. The introduction of a CBAM in the EU could result in our trade partners imposing countermeasures and sanctions in the form of restrictions on European exports to their markets. Countermeasures and sanctions would have far-reaching negative repercussions on business, trade and employment in the EU and must therefore be avoided on any account. Building up and maintaining global value chains and trade flows for internationally trading enterprises is a medium to long-term process and highly intensive in terms of time and resources. Global value chains must not be endangered by a CBAM. In the discussion thus far, important preparations have been lacking: the possible repercussions of a CBAM on the trade relations of the EU with its partner countries, strategies of the EU to prevent sanctions and retaliatory measures as well as strategies in the event that third countries impose sanctions. Studies and impact assessments on these matters must be conducted and must be submitted and discussed as quickly as possible, in any case prior to the presentation of a Commission proposal.\nPolicy recommendations and practical demands\nIt is vital that the European Commission follows the principles below in the interest of Europe’s competitiveness:\n1) The EU and its Member States must make intensive efforts to achieve internationally standardized carbon pricing. 2) The existing carbon leakage regulations for direct and indirect carbon costs have to be further improved and expanded. A CBAM must also take into account indirect carbon costs from imported goods. These costs impose massive additional cost burdens in electricity-intensive sectors of the EU ETS. As long as this inclusion of indirect carbon costs is not assured, compensation of indirect carbon costs under the EU ETS State Aid Guidelines must be fully retained and also implemented in Austria, or further harmonized across the EU. 3) The actual provisions of a CBAM must take into account the obligations of the EU within the WTO and towards its partners in trade agreements. If the EU in general lowers or eliminates tariffs on goods within the WTO and its trade agreements, it is difficult to argue that the tariffs should be raised on several of these goods or that market access should be restricted. Likewise, a CBAM and autonomous EU tariff suspensions or tariff quotas have to be reconciled in a way that does not hamper trade flows in an unintentional way. Simultaneously applying a CBAM and trade defense instruments (anti-dumping, anti-subvention, safeguard measures) on imported goods might also show adverse economic effects. The geopolitical and strategic goals of EU trade policy are to export EU values and standards worldwide through treaty-based cooperation and to take on an increasingly significant role in setting the rules for international business and trade. These goals must not be endangered by introducing unilateral trade restrictions of a CBAM kind. 4) If the EU Member States agree on a necessary and proportionate CBAM that can be practically implemented, the EU must in any case intensify and make more concrete its efforts of clarification, acceptance and alliance building towards its trade partners and in the scope of international agreements and organizations. The global challenge of climate change requires that ambitious climate protection measures be not limited to Europe. Striving for international agreements and actions is in any case preferable to an autonomous EU measure such as a CBAM. This assertion is backed by various studies that largely favour international instruments for agreeing climate goals to autonomous measures by individual international players (refer to Sapir, Horn/Sapir). 5) There is a lack of studies, analyses and statistics on the repercussions of a CBAM on the European economy and international trade flows in goods, services or investments. It is striking that the Inception Impact Assessment neither mentions studies, analyses and statistics nor names them as a vital part of future impact assessment. However, from the standpoint of the business community, they are a precondition for a serious discussion of a CBAM. Knowledge about possible repercussions of a CBAM on the trade relations of the EU with its partner countries is lacking, as are strategies of the EU to prevent sanctions and retaliatory measures as well as strategies in the event that third countries impose sanctions. By contrast, the consultation paper of the European Commission expressly announced a study “on the measure as well as other on-going studies notably on the energy markets and on the EU ETS”. Studies on all named topics (repercussions on business and trade relations, on the energy markets and the EU ETS) must be presented as quickly as possible, so that they can be incorporated in the preparations for a Commission proposal regarding a CBAM. 6) The carbon pricing structure underlying a CBAM and thus the calculation of any import tariff has to be strictly oriented to the principles of non-discrimination,\nnecessity, proportionality, scientific character, and transparency. This structure\nwill be crucial for the evaluation of conformity with valid obligations of the EU and its Member States within the WTO or other international agreements and for evaluation on the part of the affected trade partner countries. 7) The funds collected through a CBAM must flow to business as well as research and development for new climate protection measures in the EU, especially the development and upscaling of industrial low-carbon technologies. 8) The introduction of a CBAM must not impose unrealistic or unilaterally onerous goals for companies in the EU. 9) In determining new goals, provisions must be made for corresponding flexibilities, e.g. in the form of temporary exceptions, transitional periods, support measures, etc. 10) A CBAM must not undermine or incompletely replace existing carbon leakage measures, in particular free allocation of allowances in the scope of the EU ETS and compensation of indirect carbon costs in the scope of the ETS State Aid Guidelines. 11) Retention of free allocation within the EU ETS as part of carbon leakage protection: The coexistence of existing carbon leakage measures does not lead to an impermissible double regulation to the extent that the carbon leakage regulation permits free allocation of carbon certificates in the scope of the EU ETS (EUAs) only in connection with attaining the benchmark, and further is degressive in nature due to the annual reduction factor of 1.74% (or 2.2% for 2021-2030). 12) A CBAM must not lead to any shortage of or increased prices for raw materials not available in the EU in sufficient quantities or quality. Moreover, a CBAM must not lead to any disproportionate disadvantages in the further processing of imported raw and primary materials and intermediate and semi-finished products and in the use of energy sources in relation to the use of equivalent products manufactured in the EU. Otherwise, the global market competitiveness of a large part of European industry would be seriously weakened instead of being strengthened. 13) From the outset, a CBAM should be limited to a certain period of time undergoing\ncurrent evaluation as well as final reporting.\nVienna, March 2020"

Independently from the future impact of this crisis which cannot yet be anticipated, the impact assessment by the Commission of the proposed Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) mechanism should primarily try to understand if, when and how can CBAs strengthen existing carbon leakage measures. The impact assessment should also assess how the mechanism can preserve the competitiveness of EU products on export markets.

Consequently, it will be even more important for these sectors to maintain the existing system of free allocations based on benchmarks representing best performers, potentially combined with other complementary policy instruments.\nIntroduction and context:\nThe current health and sanitary emergency phase that Europe is dealing with is generating serious impacts on the economic stability of all EU Member States. These critical conditions require extraordinary interventions by the European Commission, which will inevitably require a reconsideration of the policies and instruments adopted and/or planned so far in order to avoid the collapse of the productive systems and the social cohesion in many countries. In this context the comments contained in this position paper should therefore be understood only as a technical contribution to the debate concerning Carbon Border Adjustments in the context of the inception impact assessment and future impact assessment.\nOn 11 December 2019, the President of the\nCommission, Ursula\nder\nunveiled the\nEuropean von Leyen, “European Green Deal” and the proposed the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism. With more than 1.200 installations in ETS manufacturing products as diverse as bricks & roof tiles, wall & floor tiles, refractory ceramics for industrial kilns, sanitaryware, expanded clay, clay pipes, tableware or flower pots, the European ceramic industry is well positioned to understand under which conditions Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) can be an effective instrument to help energy intensive industries moving towards carbon neutrality while remaining fully competitive, safeguarding economic and social aspects while achieving environmental goals. These 1.200 ceramic installations are mostly small emitters, representing more than 10 % of all ETS installations but less than 1% of ETS sectors’ carbon emissions. Largely composed of SMEs competing at global level, the ceramic industry is highly sensitive to overly complex and burdensome regulations and requires well balanced and simplified policy instruments.\nIn this context, Cerame-Unie sees the need for the impact assessment to take into account the following considerations:\nCeram\nUni\nbe\nThe European Ceramic\nIndustry Association\n31 March 2020\n1) Carbon Border Adjustments should be designed to strengthen carbon leakage protection in the long term\nDepending on the outcome of the ongoing decision making process on ETS benchmark updates and on the fluctuations of the carbon price (from 30€ to 50 €/tCO2), the European ceramic industry anticipates an ETS cost under Phase IV ranging from € 1 Billion to € 3 Billion, assuming that carbon leakage measures and the 2030 targets for the ETS sector remain unchanged. In the absence of any carbon leakage measure, the cost for the sector would range from € 3.8 Billion to € 6.3 Billion. Over the last years the European ceramic industry has done great investments to maintain its competitiveness in a globalised economy and reduce the carbon content of its products. Any decrease of the carbon leakage protection foreseen until 2030 would significantly jeopardise the ability of the sector to further invest in new and breakthrough technologies or to develop key technologies further to bring them to the market (marketability).\nPolicies merely increasing carbon costs on EU manufacturing without duly considering the carbon leakage risk will reduce EU carbon emissions from manufacturing as a result of relocation but will increase the EU’s consumed carbon due to imports from countries with lower or non-existing carbon costs on manufacturing. That is why the main objective of CBAs should be to strengthen existing carbon leakage measures.\n2) The CBA proposal shall be adapted to the characteristics of different industrial sectors\nSince the objective of CBAs will be to create an incentive for the decarbonisation of EU imports, this tool may only make sense for products where the EU market penetration of imports is already high. Consequently, CBAs should primarily be targeted at sectors that are import intensive (as opposed to export intensive). However, CBAs should always be conceived as a tool to complete and strengthen existing carbon leakage measures so as the deliver a genuine level playing field, not to replace those carbon leakage measures.\nMoreover, considering the potential legal and technical complexity of CBAs, such measures seem to be mainly feasible for homogeneous processes and products perceived as commodities.\nFor sectors such as the ceramic industry which has been considered as exposed to carbon leakage not because of import penetration but more as a result of a high carbon intensity combined with high exposure to exports and other market characteristics (e.g. low profitability and cost pass through ability, prospective exposure to imports, exposure to imports from countries in the peripheries of the EU, substitutability of products, etc.) while having a positive impact on the energy performance of buildings and contributing positively to the EU’s environmental goals through its longevity and recyclability, CBAs would certainly be less efficient in establishing a fair level-playing field than existing carbon leakage measures. Moreover, CBAs may prove very difficult to apply to heterogeneous products, disaggregated sectors and sectors with a high proportion of SMEs, three characteristics which prevail in the ceramic industry.\nFor such products and sectors as in the ceramic industry it will be even more important to ensure the continuation of existing direct and indirect carbon leakage measures (including compensation of the indirect costs for the next ETS trading period).\nCeram e— The\nUL Nit\nEuropean\nCeramic\nIndustry Association\n31 March 2020\n3) CBAs should preserve the competitiveness of European producers on export markets\nIt is necessary to ensure the competitiveness of EU exports to third countries, where the carbon constraint is absent or less ambitious than in the EU. The mechanism should thus include a solution for exports. For this purpose, additional measures should relieve from EU ETS extra-costs European products exported to non-EU markets without (or with less ambitious) carbon reduction policies. Since Art. XX of the GATT does not refer to the objective to maintain competitiveness as a ground to justify general exceptions, the EU institutions should explore all possible legal basis to secure a level playing field for EU exports, including Art. XVI of GATT on subsidies.\nMoreover, the risk of retaliation from our trading partners should not be underestimated. The US have already warned the EU about possible punitive measures against the EU if they found the system to be protectionist in its essence.\n4) CBAs should be WTO compatible\nThe mechanism needs to be fully WTO compatible, and thus should be built upon the key WTO principles of non-discrimination, differentiation and “likeness”. The possibility to derive from these principles shall be assessed under the exception allowed under article XX (g)* of the GATT, for environmental and climate objectives. The measure must be justified by the objective to reduce consumed carbon.\nAccordingly, the impact assessment by the European Commission should envisage different methods to determine the level of the carbon costs to be borne by imported products. Methods to be assessed include:\n- Carbon costs equivalent to the EU worst performers’ benchmark; - Carbon costs determined by the real monitored emissions corresponding to the imported product.\nThe assessment of these methodologies should take into account:\nThe capacity to deliver on the objective of reduction of domestic and global consumed carbon emissions; The ability to consider the full carbon content of products including the transportation phase of goods; The practical feasibility of these methods for different products and sectors, as different methodologies will entail different levels of complexity; The reliability and exposure to fraud and circumvention of these methods.\n1 Art. XX (g) of the GAAT: “Subject to the requirement that such not applied in which would measures are a manner constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures: (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption;”\nCeram\nUni\nbe\nThe European Ceramic\nIndustry Association\n31 March 2020\nBy no means should the Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism foresee the possibility to grant exemption to the benefit of imports from least-developed or developing countries. Considering the existing and future competition in many sectors between these countries and the European production, such exemption would seriously undermine the environmental objective of the measure.\n5) The proposal for CBAs should have a strong enforcement chapter\nThe CBA proposal should anticipate the risks of circumvention of the mechanism and should ensure that provisions are foreseen to prevent such unfair practices through traceability, certification of the carbon footprint (reflecting the full life cycle and including notably shipping emissions) and enforcement of the rules of origin. The mechanism should avoid the use of average data and privilege product specific environmental data.\n6) Revenues from CBAs should be allocated towards the low carbon transition of the European industry\nThe revenues resulting from the mechanisms should be allocated to transition and adaptation towards the carbon neutrality of the European industry through a harmonised approach that equally covers all ETS sectors across Europe.\n7) The impact assessment should also consider other regulatory instruments\nThe impact assessment should also assess the feasibility and efficiency of other regulatory instruments likely to strengthen the level-playing field by completing existing carbon leakage measures:\nA VAT type taxation applied to domestic products and imports reflecting their carbon footprint; The strengthening of EU Trade Defence Instruments, notably through a better consideration of environmental costs in the calculation of the dumping and injury margins; Improving traceability and enforcement of rules of origin; Other trade instruments: o Multilateral trade instruments: a Industrial subsidies and overcapacities (strengthening of WTO rules, use of EU anti- subsidy rules to tackle the absence of environmental costs as illegal subsidies) a Tax measures on transport a Further negotiations under Art. 6 of the UNFCC on emissions trading and carbon markets o Bilateral — Free Trade Agreements o Unilateral: a Public Procurement a General System of Preferences (GSP)"

This is necessary to enable Europe to protect the integrity of its environmental and social regulations, while protecting our companies from unfair competition, and encouraging our trading partners to achieve an equivalent level of environmental and social protection. These measures must not be expected to result in rainstorms for large polluting companies at European level. The resources harvested should not be used to finance European exporters, for example, but rather to finance the general transition towards a decarbonised society, to finance programmes for the implementation of social and environmental standards in developing countries (notably via the Green Climate Fund), as well as socially just transition measures at European level and in the Member States, in particular to structurally reduce energy poverty (building insulation).\n\nThis adjustment mechanism should be as wide as possible, covering all sectors of production.

I think it has potential to replace the bureaucracy and inflexibility of carbon leakage measures particular to the EU ETS.\n\nI would in addition, like to propose the following idea, to make the idea more palatable on an international level. I believe the levies derived by the carbon border adjustment measure should be held in trust by the EU, and redirected toward that country, once it gives an indication it would like to invest in infrastructure, research and development, technology transfer, etc., to lower the carbon intensity of the relevant sector, product or industry. For the time being, the EU could decide on the appropriate channeling, institutions and mechanisms of these funds, but hopefully this would kickstart a process for this to be adopted by an international body such as the WTO, whereby common accounting, payment etc. rules exist for all participating countries. This may even be tacked on to existing trade deals. \n\nI would also like to propose the concept of a border adjustment measure for other environmental ills, following the same logic of holding the levy/tax in trust to be channeled back toward 'levelling up' the importer country.

        "feedback": "Aluminium production and its value chain is very much different to other industries which are also exposed to Carbon Leakage, as for instance steel. This leads to numerous complications with regards to how a CBAM could effectively be implemented. \n\nAs we explain in the paper enclosed to our submission, one major challenge, among many others, is for example how to measure carbon intensity considering aluminium’s unique electro-intensive in the smelting process and the related indirect emissions. We see that replacing free allowances and CO2-compensation with a CBAM, as suggested in the Commission’s inception impact assessment, would have severe effects on the entire European aluminium value chain and its customers. \n\nAt the same time, given the still many unknowns on the possible design and scope of such a measure, we have put together in this paper a set of key principles and elements that the European Commission should carefully take into consideration if it had to introduce an effective CBAM for the Aluminium value chain. They are summarised below: \n\n•\tA CBAM must not undermine or replace existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation. These should remain in place, be prioritised and improved;\n\n•\tA CBAM would have to cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product containing the commodity. If not carefully thought through and prudently implemented, there are concrete risks of increasing costs across the entire supply chain and thus eventually undermining (rather than protecting) our industry’s competitiveness in a world market;\n\n•\tA CBAM must not replace, diminish or impair an effective trade policy, existing duties or affect trade defense measures like Antidumping and Anti-subsidy tariffs as well as Safeguards; \n\n•\tPolicymakers should first carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors (eg. steel, cement). \n\n•\tIf the CBAM also covers the carbon content for indirect emissions in the imported product, then it must also reflect the additional indirect costs European producers face compared to other global producers, in order to ensure a global level playing field (due to marginal pricing in European power markets, indirect costs are not directly correlated to indirect emissions, as explained in this paper). Hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. The two can co-exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. \n\n•\tOverall, designing a system taking into account the specificities of the Aluminium value chain and global trade flows of the commodity, will be an extremely complex task.

We thus appreciate the European Commission’s commitment to stop carbon and investment leakage, and ambition to address such issue with new tools like a CBAM.\nHowever, from a preliminary assessment of the Commission’s IIA Roadmap and discussion with our membership, we clearly see that a CBAM for the aluminium industry, which is one of the most, if not the most exposed sectors to carbon leakage, is not the best tool to achieve such policy objectives.\nOne of the\nreasons on producers’ GHG footprint. It is thus our view so far that adequate indirect costs compensation schemes and free allowances would still be the optimal way to protect our value chain from carbon leakage in Phase IV of the EU ETS’, given our sector’s significant electro-intensity in the production process and the specific global challenges we are facing, both in terms of trade and competitiveness.\nbehind this is that the carbon cost\nthe electricity price is delinked from the electricity\nAluminium production and its value chain is in fact very much different to other industries which are also exposed to Carbon Leakage, as for instance steel. This leads to numerous complications with regards to how a CBAM could effectively be implemented.\nAs we explain in this paper, one major challenge, among many others, is for example how to measure carbon intensity considering aluminium’s unique electro-intensive in the smelting process and the related indirect emissions. We see that replacing free allowances and CO2-compensation with a CBAM, as suggested in the\n1 See here European Commission Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap the proposal for Directive for EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on a an 2 Under EU State Aid Rules, to address carbon leakage of electro-intensive industries, Member States give compensation to certain sectors for the increases can in electricity prices as a result of the indirect costs of the EU ETS. These Guidelines — often referred to as ‘the ETS State Aid Guidelines’ are currently being reviewed. New Guidelines expected to be established later in 2020 and will set the rules throughout Phase IV up to 2030. See here our response to the European Commission’s consultation on the draft ETS State Aid Guidelines (March 2020).\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/1\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Bru els, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nCOG\n/ Position\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAt the same time, given the still many unknowns on the possible design and scope of such a measure, we have put together in this paper a set of key principles and elements that the European Commission should carefully take into consideration if it had to introduce an effective CBAM for the Aluminium value chain. They are summarised below:\nA CBAM must not undermine or replace existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation. These should remain in place, be prioritised and improved; A CBAM would have to cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product containing the commodity. If not carefully thought through and prudently implemented, there are concrete risks of increasing costs across the entire supply chain and thus eventually undermining (rather than protecting) our industry’s competitiveness in a world market; A CBAM must not replace, diminish or impair an effective trade policy, existing duties or affect trade defense measures like Antidumping and Anti-subsidy tariffs as well as Safeguards; Policymakers should first carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors (eg. steel, cement). If the CBAM also covers the carbon content for indirect emissions in the imported product, then it must also reflect the additional indirect costs European producers face compared to other global producers, in order to ensure a global level playing field (due to marginal pricing in European power markets, indirect costs are not directly correlated to indirect emissions, as explained in this paper). Hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. The two can co-exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. Overall, designing a system taking into account the specificities of the Aluminium value chain and global trade flows of the commodity, will be an extremely complex task. It will be paramount to first clearly assess the impact of a CBAM at each stage of the aluminium value chain. A legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products will be needed. Any proposed mechanism should be WTO compliant, not undermine the existing framework, should avoid creating additional burden, and should foresee tools to effectively avoid its circumvention. Financial revenues from the system should be used primarily to encourage research and innovation in carbon-reducing technologies and investments for the decarbonisation of the European industry.\nIn light of the challenges and complexities above, it is our preliminary view that a CBAM for aluminium is not an adequate instrument to address carbon leakage in our sector. We invite the Commission to instead improve the existing framework and consider other tools to support our industry’s transformation and commitment to the EU’s Green Deal objectives. This especially in view of the announced higher climate ambition for 2030 and our sector’s unique and advanced electro-intensive nature compared to our energy intensive industries in Europe (e.g. chemicals, steel, cement).\nThe Aluminium value chain\nEurope’s aluminium production is already one of the least carbon-intensive in the world. Furthermore, the European aluminium industry’s carbon footprint will continue to decline as the European electricity mix decarbonises. Given\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nan\nEU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nCommission’s inception impact assessment, would have severe effects on the entire European aluminium value chain and its customers.\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/2\n/ Position on Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap for an EU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nthat the production process for primary aluminium is already fully electrified (in line with the Commission’s 2050 long-term strategy), the decarbonisation of the power sector alone will lead to a 58% decrease of the carbon footprint of Europe’s primary aluminium production by 2050 (compared to 2014 levels)’.\nAluminium’s unique properties and uses in energy-efficient products for buildings, packaging and mobility (amongst others) also make it an essential material in the transition towards carbon neutrality. It is a key element for the production of the technologies that will lead Europe towards carbon neutrality, such as RES units and electricity/data transmission grids. Recycling aluminium is another important way of saving CO2 emissions and energy.\nPreserving our primary and semi-manufacturing production as well as further developing our recycling activities will be absolutely necessary in order to meet the growing demand for aluminium products, while reducing our dependency on imports. The EU28 still imports approximately 50 percent of its aluminium ingot requirements’. Norway and Iceland, as part of the European Economic Area (EEA), are the largest exporters of primary aluminium to the EU. Other major exporters of primary products to European countries are Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Mozambique, while semi-fabricated and finished products are imported from several countries based on primary metal from China and others with high GHG footprint. Overall, domestic demand of aluminium is fulfilled through both primary and recycled production?.\nFurthermore, over the past five years, Chinese exports of aluminium products to the EU have more than doubled, particularly in the case of semi-fabricated products (flat rolled products, including foil, and extruded products). The carbon footprint of these imports is much higher than the equivalent European production (90% of Chinese primary aluminium production is based on energy from coal-fired power plants®).\nImportance of preserving existing carbon leakage measures\nCarbon intensity of primary aluminium production in Europe has decreased by more than half since 1990, via improvements in energy efficiency, reduction of PFC emissions and anode consumption from the electrolytic ’ process. However, carbon leakage is already happening in our sector because the carbon cost on the electricity price is delinked from the electricity producers GHG footprint: despite a growing global demand for our metal, Europe has lost more than 30% of its primary production capacity since 2008, and this production is being replaced by imports from other regions in the world. Aluminium competes with other materials in its key markets but, given its high electro-intensity, it faces different regulatory and cost challenges compared for example to steel.\nTo date, there are only 16 smelters remaining in the EU 28°, meaning that approximately half of our demand for primary material relies on imports from third countries. Of these imports, 30% come from 10 smelters in EFTA countries, Norway and Iceland, regulated under the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS). The idling of smelting capacity in the EU and the lack of investment in new capacity is explained to a great extent by the fact that Europe has higher electricity prices compared to its main competitors? (Russia, UAE and China), whereas electricity accounts for roughly 40% of primary aluminium production costs. Higher electricity prices in Europe are attributable to regulatory costs -mainly as a result of the EU’s climate-related policies- as is the case with power producers passing\n3 See European Aluminium Vision 2050 report here\n4 See European Aluminium Digital Activity Report 2018 2019, Market Overview here —\n5 See European Aluminium Vision 2050 report here 16: According to scenario analysis, with supportive policies by 2050, recycled and primary , p. our are expected to have almost equal shares of total European demand\n© See: http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminium-smelting-power-consumption/\n7 See European Aluminium Vision 2050 report here\n8 See European Aluminium Digital Activity Report 2018 2019, Section II: Market Overview here —\n2\nSee CEPS Study, commissioned by DG ENERGY, here “Composition and drivers of energy prices and costs in energy intensive industries”, 14 January 2019\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/3\n/ Position on Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap for an EU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\ncosts of buying emission allowances under the EU ETS (indirect carbon costs). No aluminium companies outside Europe face similar carbon costs, whereas various other regulatory costs are also exclusively European. Given that aluminium prices are set in global markets, European producers are not able to pass these extra costs on to consumers without losing significant market share. Furthermore, some players in the global aluminium industry are also heavily subsidised”®.\nTo this end, the Commission adopted in 2012 the Guidelines on certain State aid measures in the context of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme post-2012 (“2012 ETS Guidelines”) for the purpose of addressing the risk of carbon leakage. The guidelines allow Member States to compensate electro-intensive undertakings in sectors exposed to international trade, for the increase in electricity prices resulting from the EU ETS costs passed on by power producers, so called “indirect costs”. DG Competition is now reviewing the Guidelines for the trading period 2021-2030 (Phase IV) of the ETS. The European aluminium industry’s survival vis-a-vis competition from global players is absolutely dependent on the compensation of these ETS indirect costs, through Member States compensation based on these guidelines.\nETS indirect cost compensation is currently partial, degressive and uncertain across the EU. This has led to increased uncertainty for aluminium producers in Europe, who will face even higher carbon costs in phase IV of the ETS, thus adversely affecting their ability to engage in long-term planning (crucial for capital-intensive industries). The global competitiveness of our sector will also depend on the outcome of the evaluation of the Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection and Energy (EEAG), which will address incremental regulatory costs related to EU energy and climate policies under the upcoming European Green Deal initiative.\nTherefore, in the short term, the Commission should focus and improve the existing carbon leakage instruments for both direct and indirect costs by making them more adequate and proportional, which is absolutely necessary in order to protect the global competitiveness of Europe’s most electro-intensive sectors.\nPreliminary considerations\nAluminium production and the value chain is very much different to other industries, as for instance steel. This leads to numerous complications with regard to how a CBAM could effectively be implemented on imports of aluminium products. One example of a major challenge will be how to measure carbon intensity, considering aluminium’s unique electro-intensive in the smelting process and the related indirect emissions.\nThis means that the greater part of its carbon footprint consists of indirect emissions, unlike to steel and cement production, and therefore depends on the carbon content of the electricity grid.\nKeeping in mind these complexities, the Aluminium industry believes that:\ne A CBAM should not undermine or replace existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation, which should remain in place, be prioritised and improved; A CBAM must not replace, diminish or impair an effective trade policy, existing duties or affect trade defense measures like Antidumping and Anti-subsidy tariffs as well as Safeguards;\n10 See OECD report “Measuring distortions in international markets: the aluminium value chain”, January 2019: China affects international prices through subsidised dumping. It produces 57% of worldwide primary aluminium, compared to 10% 15 years ago. According to OECD, 85% of the $70bn support to aluminium companies worldwide went to just 5 Chinese firms.\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/4\n/ Position\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nan\nEU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nPolicymakers should carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors. If not carefully thought through and prudently implemented, there are concrete risks of increasing costs across the entire supply chain and thus eventually undermining (rather than protecting) our industry’s competitiveness in a world market; Overall, designing a system taking into account the specificities of the Aluminium value chain and global trade flows of the commodity, will be an extremely complex task; Any proposed mechanism should not undermine the existing framework, should avoid creating additional burden, and should foresee tools to effectively avoid its circumvention.\nIt will thus be paramount to first clearly assess the impact of a CBAM at each stage of the aluminium value chain.\nBorder adjustment vs carbon leakage measures\nSeveral proposals for a CBAM focus on levelling out the carbon costs faced by European producers with those of foreign producers. This would in theory mean that as a default, all imported products would face the same climate- related costs as products produced in Europe.\nThere are also proposals which foresee that producers in third countries would be able to apply for a company- specific assessment based on their actual emissions. This would mean that foreign producers with lower emissions than EU producers would pay less tax, but foreign producers with higher emissions than the EU average would not pay more than the default tax based on average EU costs. In order for a CBAM to have a clear climate rationale, it must ensure that a product with a higher carbon footprint is taxed higher than a similar product with a lower carbon footprint.\nThe challenge is how to measure the carbon footprint of aluminium and how to price it considering:\ne The absence of a global carbon market; Its electro-intensive nature; The issue of indirect emissions and indirect ETS costs; The issue of which price to be used for calculating a possible tax levy as long as the prices of EU allowances are volatile.\nHowever, even if a CBAM includes taxing indirect emissions in imported products, this would not protect European electro-intensive industry from carbon and investment leakage caused by the indirect CO2-costs, given the marginal pricing system used in European power markets:\nEuropean producers’ exposure to indirect EU ETS costs is determined by the carbon cost that is inherent in the marginal electricity price (regardless of the carbon content of the electricity that is actually consumed). Therefore, the only way to create a genuine level playing field (thereby ensuring WTO compliance) would be for the CBAM to also focus on indirect costs, rather than being limited to measuring indirect emissions\".\nIn other words, there is no direct link between the carbon content of the electricity consumed and the indirect costs passed on by power providers, which aluminium producers would producers face even when consuming completely decarbonised electricit via a renewable PPA). Electricit rices are set by the marginal unit, which is often a\n1 For marginal pricing EC Impact assessment SWD EU Electricity Markets reform (30.11.2016) and EC Impact assessment Report 2012 State more on see on on Aid Guidelines on indirect costs 22.05.2012\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n1/5\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Bru els, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nEU\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nnatural as or coal/lignite lant that faces carbon costs, and therefore all European electricit rices contain an . inherent carbon which is directly correlated the carbon footprint of the electricity in question. cost, not to\nAs a consequence, a CBAM setting an additional duty on an imported aluminum product based only on its environmental footprint (encompassing both direct and indirect emissions) would theoretically either:\nIt would however not be an effective tool for the short-term to ensure a level playing field with regards to production costs for European producers against the rest of the world. Therefore, indirect cost compensation would have to be maintained alongside such a scheme in order to prevent carbon leakage.\nKey principles for a CBAM fit for the aluminium value chain\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/6\nCOG\n/ Position\nan\n/\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\ne incentivise third country producers to reduce their footprint to avoid paying the additional duty; e or (more likely) cause a shift of trade flows so that low-carbon material is imported into the EU and the high- carbon material will remain traded outside the EU, thus failing to achieve the EU’s international commitment to push for the reduction of overall global emissions (in fact this would more likely lead to an increase in global emissions).\nEU policymakers are increasingly looking into how to design a CBAM to step up the EU’s climate ambitions vis-a-vis other global players. Bearing in mind the challenges and complexities above, we believe that should it cover Aluminium, the following conditions will have to be met and carefully considered in any future impact assessment work in order to preserve and grow our value chain in Europe:\ne A CBAM should not replace nor undermine existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation. ETS indirect costs compensation schemes should remain in place and not be diluted: only the European aluminium industry faces CO2 costs passed through electricity prices. For primary aluminium producers indirect EU ETS costs are 6 to 7 times larger than the direct costs. Due to the marginal price setting mechanism in the European power market, even a strongly decarbonised electricity supply will still bear indirect CO2-costs. For this reason, setting a CBAM on indirect emissions alone will not mitigate the carbon leakage risk due to indirect CO2 costs. Hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. The two can co-exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. A CBAM should put a price based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products and reflect the carbon costs: A CBAM should firstly have a clear climate rationale. A product with high carbon footprint should be taxed higher than a similar product with low carbon footprint. At the same time, in case the CBAM also covers indirect emissions, then it is crucial to ensure that the relevant calculations take into account the marginal pricing system used in European power markets in order to ensure a level playing field in terms of indirect costs. A CBAM would have to cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product containing the commodity. If this is not the case, the downstream segment might have an incentive to move production out of Europe, as importing the primary material would become too expensive. In addition, going down the value chain and depending on the specificities of each market, businesses may decide to delocalise in order to source components directly from abroad accessing them “CBAM-free”. This would threaten the survival of upstream producers in Europe. As an example: if only primary aluminium were covered by the CBAM, road wheel producers would move production out of Europe\n/ Position\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nan\nEU\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nin order to avoid becoming uncompetitive and European automotive OEMs would source finished aluminium road wheels from abroad — CBAM-free. As explained above, due to marginal pricing, European electricity prices are impacted by the EU ETS cost, regardless of the GHG footprint of the electricity in question. For this reason, all well-designed and functioning tools designed to address industry CO2 emissions and carbon leakage, such as ETS free allowances and indirect compensation must remain in place. There should be no trade-offs and complementarity must be ensured. Related to this, the CBAM should not apply to countries that have joined the EU ETS system or that have similarly stringent tax systems on emissions; A CBAM should focus on emissions across the whole life-cycle of products: For example, the electrolysis process is where there are large differences in the CO2 emissions pattern, due to difference in indirect emissions (a result on the CO2 content of the electricity consumed). Other parts of the value chain have much less variation in emissions, though alumina production is also heavily reliant on carbon-intensive heat- production outside of Europe. Thus, the first focus of a CBAM should be on the carbon footprint of the primary metal, to then be used as a basis for further carbon footprint assessments along the value chain. For instance, if a downstream product is produced in Turkey with primary metal from South Africa, the carbon footprint of the downstream product should be based on both the South African footprint (with regard to the primary metal) and the Turkish one (with regard to processing in Turkey). A legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products will be needed, including the aluminium content in each product. A robust MRV system is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that third-country exporters are not able to circumvent (or otherwise ‘game’) the CBAM. For example, 90% of Chinese primary aluminium production is based on coal-fired electricity generation, whereas the remaining 10% is based on hydropower’. Therefore, without a robust disclosure system, a Chinese exporter could simply declare that its aluminium was produced using hydropower (even if this isn’t true), in order to bypass the CBAM. Third countries would be incentivized to re-route all their ‘cleaner’ production to Europe (displacing European production), while continuing to cover demand across the rest of the world using carbon-intensive production. This would actually lead to an increase in global emissions, i.e. carbon leakage. The CBAM system needs to be WTO Compliant: Aluminium is already highly politically exposed due to US Section 232 tariffs and the subsequent retaliatory actions. The introduction of a CBAM could trigger an avalanche of WTO complaints against the EU by third countries. If the EU lost the disputes, what could follow would either be the EU introducing changes to its CBAM system, which would create uncertainty for business; or WTO-authorized tariffs issued against the EU; The EU should be prepared for retaliation from other economies and assess its implications on EU companies’ market access in third countries. Financial revenues from the system should be used primarily to encourage research and innovation in carbon-reducing technologies and investments for the decarbonisation of the European industry.\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Bru els, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\n22 http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminium-smelting-power-consumption/\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/7\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\n/\n/ Position on Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap for an EU\nCOG\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nApril 2020\nTo conclude, all the elements above must be taken into account in upcoming impact assessment work, which should also include a sensitivity analysis of CO2 prices based on the impact of the CBAM and evolution of the carbon price.

A CO2 compensation mechanism at the boarders should go hand in hand with EU policies based on mandatory recycled contents, such as the Directive 2019/904 on Single Use Plastics, which foresees 25% mandatory recycled PET in beverage bottles as from 2025, and 30% (PET and other polymers) in 2030. The Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) adopted on the 11 of March 2020 puts clearly in the agenda that mandatory recycled content should be extended to other products, such as packaging, construction products, automotive.\nHowever, such EU regulations aiming at making the economy more circular result in increased costs in the whole product life cycle. Eco-design of products, selective collection of waste, sorting, depolluting, preparing for recycling: the whole production chain is more costly when based on recycling, than when using virgin materials.\nThat is why a CBAM should have under its scope the products that are covered, within EU, by mandatory recycled contents. That would be an essential tool against eco-dumping, and a necessary complement to mandatory recycled contents policies. It would strengthen European recycling markets, by consolidating the internal EU demand for recyclates, resulting in more investments in the recycling chain, and more competitive supply of recyclates in the EU market.\nIn addition, a CBAM would also facilitate closing the loop within the EU economy by sourcing more waste as material resources for industrial production. EU manufacturing industries would benefit from an improved competitiveness on products containing recyclates, compared to imported virgin material-based ones.\nFurthermore, a CBAM would allow EU industries to compete on an equal footing with competitors from third countries which do not regulate their industries’ carbon emissions, nor regulate the whole material products’ life cycle by requesting the incorporation of recyclates in manufactured goods.\n4. With regard to green manufacturing, as part of the eco-labelling scheme foreseen by the Circular Economy Action plan, the EC should envisage a carbon label on products that are manufactured or sold within the Union. It would reflect the CO2 intensity in products and show the performance of products using recycled materials versus products that are made only with virgin resources.\n5. Undoubtedly, the implementation of a CBAM would face numerous practical, economic and legal challenges and constraints, the latter with regards to International Trade Law and especially with ensuring the mechanism is WTO- compatible. In order to achieve that, the mechanism needs to be applied to third\nTitle — Date\na\ncountries and trade partners without prejudice to the non-discrimination principle. The key is to structure any accompanying measure as a straightforward extension of the domestic climate policy to imports. The CBAM should be deployed gradually, starting with pilot sectors, where carbon content of product is easy to evaluate and establish, both for domestic and for imported products.\n6. In order to design a functioning and successful CBAM, FEAD believes that further cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments are needed, especially with regards to comparing the carbon footprint of products with recycled content and products with virgin materials. Such an assessment would show the importance of mandatory recycling content in the EU industries and how that should be linked with the CBAM. A cost-benefit analysis of the mechanism is also required, based on detailed implementation aspects and related costs.\nIn-depth analyses should be conducted with regards to the practical feasibility of the mechanism, the legal aspects involved, the compatibility of the mechanism with the EU ETS scheme and with WTO rules. Avoiding political risks of conflict with trade partners will be crucial for the success of a CBAM, bearing in mind that secondary raw materials market is a global one and any policy changes that would affect trade of recyclates are also significant to our sector.\nFEAD, the European Federation for Waste Management and Environmental Services, represents the private waste and resource management industry across Europe. FEAD’s members are national waste management associations covering 19 Member States, Norway and Serbia.

Our members account for more than €500 billion in annual turnover, as well as for millions of jobs across the EU. We support the goal of the European Union to fight climate change and make Europe the most sustainable economy globally. To achieve those goals, it is essential to put in place policies which strengthen the Union’s manufacturing industry and keep EU manufacturing value chains competitive.\nWe ask the Commission to consider the points expressed below in designing a proposal for any CBA mechanism. As a preliminary comment, and in the light of the current health and sanitary emergency and the economic crisis that will follow in the EU, it will be essential to adapt decarbonisation policies to the new context, in particular to avoid the collapse of productive systems and social cohesion throughout the EU.\n1. Fundamentally, a CBA mechanism must be designed so as to contribute to the objective of decarbonisation in the EU by strengthening and completing existing measures protecting European industries from the risk of “carbon leakage”, or the risk of relocation of manufacturing and investment. Accordingly, free allocations should be maintained as a complement to border measures to avoid all forms of carbon leakage. On the other hand, it must be recognised that for some sectors, CBAs may not be appropriate and complementary measures in addition to free allocations and indirect costs compensation should be considered. The underlying aim is to ensure the equal treatment of all products placed on the EU market with regard to the limitations and costs of decarbonisation measures.\nThe CBA mechanism must in principle apply regardless of the country from which a product is imported. For example, the CBA must apply to products from a given country regardless of the preferential status of that country under EU legislation and/or the designation of that country as a developing country by a multilateral institution. The CBA mechanism must reflect the cap or limitation on EU carbon emissions as well as the costs for those emissions which are permitted. A carbon border mechanism must not replace, and a priori any transitional period of CBA application must not endanger, existing direct and indirect EU carbon leakage measures, including ETS free allowances and indirect costs compensation.\n2. This implies that:\ne A CBA mechanism designed in this manner can then provide strong incentives for third countries to decarbonise local manufacturing, and reach a common approach with the EU on carbon pricing and related issue.\ne A CBA mechanism must not only consider the carbon footprint of imports but also reflect the overall carbon footprint of making those or similar products in the places where the essential manufacturing steps take place. Thus, while a CBA mechanism must in principle be based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products, i.e. not a simple average benchmark or ad valorem, other policies may be relevant in setting the carbon cost to be imposed on imports.\nMeasuring the carbon footprint of imports and reflecting the total manufacturing emissions in the places where the essential manufacturing steps take place requires a proper and efficient system of measurement, with incentives and sanctions to maximise the cooperation of importers and their third country suppliers. In cases where data is not made available in a timely and complete manner, or cooperation is otherwise materially deficient, default values should be used which do not allow an opportunity for free-riding. The general acceptance of on-site verification visits at the places where essential manufacturing steps take place must be considered a fundamental requirement for cooperation.\nWhile full carbon accounting should, in principle, ultimately cover the entire value chain,\nupstream and downstream, from the primary raw materials and other inputs (including\nenergy) down to final end products, and include transport to the EU port of final destination,\na transitional approach with a border measure focused on the most carbon-intensive steps is\na practicable starting point. Full carbon accounting in turn will require a robust analysis of\nthe whole supply chain for each sector to capture sectorial specificities and needs, especially\nduring any transitional period.\nA CBA mechanism must provide for appropriate and efficient cost adjustments to address trade flow manipulations such as source shifting and CBA absorption. This is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of a CBA in tackling carbon leakage.\nAny steps taken to simplify measurements must not significantly increase the risk of CBA\navoidance. In addition, the CBA mechanism must provide sufficient scope for adjustments to\naddress any inadequacy that arises or becomes evident after implementation.\nTo have a coherent focus on products placed on the EU market and to ensure proper\nincentives for third countries to reach a common approach with the EU on carbon pricing,\nany CBA should not result in the impairment of the competitiveness of EU exports to third\ncountries.\n3. While the minimisation of additional administrative burdens is important, an effective CBA mechanism requires a legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions in the production of the affected products.\n4. Also, while CBA enforcement would naturally be entrusted to Member States, there need to be sufficiently detailed rules at EU level to ensure the availability of timely information and the application of effective and dissuasive Member State measures to penalise avoidance.\n5. Throughout the process of putting in place a comprehensive CBA mechanism, transparency and close dialogue with trading partners will be important. However, the EU must not be held hostage to delays in finding agreement before putting in place a fully functioning CBA mechanism. In addition, the EU must:\nbe prepared to defend fully its CBA mechanism under existing international agreements, including the WTO Agreements, without backing down in the face of unilateral pressures from third countries; not revise the CBA mechanism in the context of agreement on bilateral or multilateral instruments that are only meant to support “green” technologies/products (e.g. Environmental Goods Agreement) or achieve other aims besides comprehensive and effective carbon pricing across borders; ensure that third country carbon pricing and limitation arrangements are effectively implemented, and compatible with EU arrangements (i.e. impose similar costs and limitations for a similar carbon footprint in a given sector), before agreeing to make any linkages with the systems of those third countries.\n6. To be coherent with the objective of the CBA, and EU climate policy objectives in general, funds raised from the CBA should be used primarily to encourage research and innovation in carbon- reducing technologies related to manufacturing and facilitate their application in the EU.\n7. The upcoming CBA impact assessment should be an integral part of a broader discussion between the EU institutions and all the stakeholders potentially concerned. In particular, the design of a CBA proposal should not be detached from the discussion and implementation of the New Industrial Strategy for Europe. At the same time, the elaboration of a CBA proposal should not pre-empt the strengthening and development of other EU policy instruments which can contribute to mitigating the risk of carbon leakage through a fair level playing field in relation to the many environment- or health and safety-related costs borne by the EU manufacturing sector but not fully by producers outside the EU."

        "pdf_text": "We connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\n#BSP_Paper April 2020\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n1 Introduction\nThe document below is an attempt to draw preliminary conclusions on the concept of an EU-level adjustment mechanism on imports of products whose manufacturing process is accompanied by carbon dioxide emission (\"Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\", CBAM). It is based on the input of three sectors of the Polish economy associated in Business & Science Poland, namely fertilisers, fuel-refinery and non-ferrous metal production.\nFrom the perspective of the above-mentioned sectors, introduction of CBAM at EU level is justified due to the need for support of the EU’s efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions. Lack of burden-sharing for the imported goods with a cost equivalent to that borne by the European industry means that non- European producers are not motivated to undertake pro-climatic efforts. This is counter-productive to the EU actions on environmental issues and furthermore poses a threat to the development of industry and jobs preservation in the EU?.\nThe introduction of CBAM will serve the following purposes:\n— will be an incentive to reduce the carbon footprint by the non-EU producers, — reduce the incentive to relocate the EU industry under pressure of climate costs in the EU, — restore the competitive balance of European energy-intensive industries vis-a-vis producers outside the EU.\nPossible form of CBAM\nSectoral approach\nDue to the innovative nature of this instrument, CBAM should be introduced gradually and on sector- by-sector basis.\nDuring the testing phase of this concept, the system should be simple and easy to use, and the risk of retaliation should be minimised. These criteria are primarily met by the fertilizer sector which could, therefore, be covered by CBAM in its first phase. The following are in favour of covering the fertiliser sector:\n— Easy calculation of the carbon footprint in the product — Significant imports into the EU and small exports outside the EU — Alimited number of exporters to the EU, which would facilitate the system management.\nThe fuel sector? would also be a beneficiary of CBAM. In addition, sector-specific market access regulations would facilitate the management of the system (see further below).\n1 According Carbon-Cap.eu, emissions generated within the EU fell by 13% between 1990 and 2010, but the actual EU to carbon footprint increased by 8%. Many EU countries are net importers of carbon present in the end products. * would be preferable only the diesel market for CBAM, the European fuel is diesel importer. It to cover as sector a net Gasoline imports to the EU are small while exports are significant.\nPage 1 of 3\n+ 32 487 24 58 58 info@zpbsp.com Rue Belliard 40, 1000 Brussels Ksiazeca 4, 00-498 Warsaw www.zpbsp.com\nEU Transparency Register Number: 548212735276-89\nBUSINESS & SCIENCE\nPOLAND\nBSP\nWe connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\nThe non-ferrous metal production sector should not be included in the CBAM pilot phase. This is due to two factors:\n— the pro-export nature of this activity and the related possibility of retaliation, — challenges regarding the need to include also indirect emissions in the CBAM, i.e. those generated in the production of electricity, which is an important cost element for this sector.\n3. Border Fee\nThe fee resulting from CBAM should apply when the foreign product is admitted to the EU market, i.e. at the moment of importation. The importer under the customs procedure has the necessary information needed to determine the amount of any CBAM fee: name of the goods, customs code, as well as the manufacturer and the country of origin.\nIn the case of the fuel sector, this solution can be modified. Due to the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), admission to the market of the imported fuel as well as the EU-produced fuel takes place under the strict supervision of the market regulator or tax administration. This enables efficient charging of fees under the existing fuel admission system.\nThe collection of fees at this point for both EU and imported fuels would also enable the introduction of more far-reaching solutions, i.e. the transfer of the carbon footprint fee from the production process (as currently assumed by the ETS) to the level of fuel consumption.\nThe preferred solution, however, is to introduce an additional fee at the border (or at another entry point to the market), rather than extending the existing ETS to imports as well. If ETS would include the imported goods, the demand for allowances will increase sharply and increase prices to the unbearable levels. This would imply the need to increase the amount of emission allowances and would politically complicate the process.\nThe amount of the fee should take into account:\n— the difference between the product's carbon footprint in the EU (determined on the basis of the ETS reference point) and the country of origin of the imported product, — the average price of the EU emission allowance.\nETS generates the cost per ton of a given product manufactured in the EU according to the formula: carbon footprint in a product x price of emission allowance?. As a rule, a similar cost should be charged to the imported product.\n4. Basis and individual rate\nIn this way, the basic fee for a given product from a given country would be calculated and automatically updated and charged at the border.\nDue to the WTO requirements, the border fee cannot be discriminatory. Therefore, the system should provide for the possibility of adapting the fee as much as possible to the specific level of emissions of\nthe imported product and the possibility for the individual exporter to show that it is:\n— lower than the adopted reference point in the EU, — lower than the one adopted generally or for a given country.\n3 The of emission allowances is evolving, therefore, of several months should be used. This would imply cost an average an analogy to the anti-dumping system which allows the calculation of the duty rate based on historical data.\nPage 2 of 3\n+ 32 487 24 58 58 info@zpbsp.com Rue Belliard 40, 1000 Brussels Ksiazeca 4, 00-498 Warsaw www.zpbsp.com\nEU Transparency Register Number: 548212735276-89\nBUSINESS & SCIENCE\nPOLAND\nBSP\nWe connect the Polish Business and Science with the EU\nThe fee set in this way would be individual. A similar solution occurs under the system of anti-dumping and countervailing measures.\nThe individual rate should be calculated according to the same formula as the EU reference point: carbon footprint x average EU emission price (in the chosen period).\n5. Existing tools and CBAM\nThere is an argument in the discussion that as a consequence of the introduction of CBAM, it is necessary to eliminate the existing instruments preventing carbon leakage (ETS free allowances, compensation for indirect emissions).\nIn our view the conditionality \"CBAM\" or \"existing instruments\" is flawed.\n— CBAM’s aim is to incorporate imports into climate policy. This is the only instrument responding to the problem of the EU's carbon footprint related to imports. CBAM is a new concept which requires testing and a pilot approach. Replacing the proven instruments with an unverified one would be irresponsible towards the EU industry and provoke resistance - to the detriment of the EU climate policy. Further, free ETS allowances and compensation for indirect emissions seem to be the only WTO compliant instrument to counteract the loss of competitiveness of the European industry on export markets, where competitors are not burdened with the cost of climate policies. CBAM will not address this problem. In designing a CBAM, it is also imperative to take into account the costs of indirect emissions, i.e. those resulting from the use of electricity in industrial processes imposed by the ETS costs.\n6 Summary\nThe CBAM system outlined as above would create market incentives for importing low-carbon products into the EU and wold be an economic incentive to reduce emissions worldwide. In addition, due to the possibility of obtaining a lower rate adequate to the individual emission level, the system will force exporters to strive for some form of confirmation by the EU that their emission level is below the EU reference point. Such a \"certification\" system would be the first step to introduce the EU ETS to EU trading partners. If companies from these countries are already \"certified\" in the ETS, the barrier of introducing a similar system in that country will decrease.\nAbout BSP\nBusiness and Science Poland (BSP) connects the experience of leading Polish enterprises with the EU agenda.

Therefore, more ambitious climate policy measures put a lot of stress on those who use more energy and produce more carbon intensive goods.\nWe should remember that a responsible approach to energy transition also requires designing measures within industrial policy supporting competitiveness and adjustment of the European energy-intensive industry. The energy transition is to be implemented in a highly competitive international environment where jobs offshoring and carbon leakage are real problems. These must be addressed by combining political and economic tools, including an appropriate trade policy.\nThe transition towards a carbon neutral economy is already a huge challenge for companies in Central Europe region. It would be extremely hard for them to compete with non-European companies, which do not take part in the transition processes. The risk of carbon leakage is bigger, in the light of the plans to increase the emission reduction targets for 2030.\nCEEP is in principle in favour of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism which shall create the level playing field for European and non-European producers. Taking into account the increased climate ambitions announced in the European Green Deal but also the process of recovery of the European economies following the COVID-19 outbreak, the equal treatment of EU and non-EU companies is of utmost importance for maintaining the production and proper functioning of European industry.\nIn this regard, the EU should strive to achieve a level playing field for undertakings producing goods (i.e. fertilizers) or generating electricity within the EU and those from outside of the Union. Third countries regulatory regimes may foresee lower environmental and safety standards than those in the EU, which sometimes may be reflected in marginally lower\nes\nO\nCEEP\nCentral Europe Energy Partners\nelectricity or product prices. It is particularly true in the EU neighborhood where there are a lack of a carbon markets and lower enivironemental standards.\nDesigning the CBAM, the European Commission should bear in mind that this kind of mechanism cannot replace the current ETS system and the carbon leakage tools that are functioning, including free allowances and indirect costs compensation. CBAM can be operational as an additional element which supports domestic producers and protect them from an unfair competition from outside. Recent years has shown that the increase of prices of ETS allowances but also the increasing lack of allowances in certain sectors, has in consequence led to the higher costs of production and lowering the competitiveness in the global market.\nCBAM as a completely new instrument in the EU policies, should be thoroughly assessed by the in-depth impact assessment, broad discussion with stakeholders, including which sectors should come first, its compatibility with international trade agreements and WTO rules. It should be also introduced gradually with relevant diplomatic efforts on the global scene.\nA mechanism such as CBAM would ensure a level playing field for European and non-European producers and could normalise the situation and prevent carbon leakage. Especially the carbon content issue should be addressed in an efficient way. Only, if third countries are cooperating in the effort to reduce GHG emissions, our European actions make sense. CBAM should therefore incentivise trade partners to strengthen their own climate efforts. Otherwise it would create a hostile environment in trade relations\nAssuming the increase of EU climate ambitions — there is a need to protect EU industrial competitiveness and to introduce relevant measures\nO\na —) —\nCentral Europe Energy Partners"

Our current membership of 27,000 companies ranges from small family-owned businesses to multinational companies in all industrial sectors.\nNHO strongly support the Paris agreement and the European vison of net-zero emission by 2050 and 1.5-degree policies. \nInternational trade and competition\n\nA sensitive balance must be found on how to use trade as leverage for climate goals while not scaling back on the economic purpose of the trade agenda. Market integration is the core of what the EU/EEA is all about, peace through trade.\n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) requires serious consideration of feasibility, costs and risk. It is NHOs primary opinion that a CBAM should be considered as a last resort, if all other measures to mitigate carbon leakage for European business fail. A CBAM which is fit-for-purpose must be designed carefully and precisely in order to mitigate the risk of retaliation from large trade partners. \nIdeally, the move towards climate neutrality by economies should include the introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms worldwide. International business supports the net-zero vision but see little realism in this target without international carbon markets.\n\nAlternatives to CBAM acceptable under current WTO regime, such as environmental standards, product declarations, labelling and the use of life-cycle assessments must not be underestimated as tools of competitiveness keeping production in Europe. The disclosure of production processes underlines and supports Europe's green competitive edge and if enforced in procurement would greatly lower imports of competing goods with more environmental footprint. \n\nCBAM design \nIn order to implement CBAM one need a system to determine carbon content. That implies full transparency about of origin(s) and content(s) in all products, including recycled content and a legitimate system to calculate content and disclose emissions of production. Hence, the taxation must be based on the carbon content of primary and secondary production including both direct and indirect CO2-emissions along the whole value chain. Consequently, the design of a CBAM will be challenging and subject to many uncertainties although critical in order to ensure that the measure is fit-for-purpose and safeguarding against the risk of retaliation from trade partners. \n\nFor NHO the following principles are imperative for a CBAM to contribute to EU ambitions of combing climate action with value creation: \n\n-\tA CBAM design must be WTO-compliant, to safeguard against the risk of retaliatory measures from major trading partners harming European business and industry's global competitiveness.\n\n-\tA CBAM must be fully functional and compatible with EU ETS, and must not in any way weaken our well-functioning climate market. \n\n-\tIt is imperative that a CBAM is based on a finely tuned system to determine carbon content.

This work was concluded at the end of 2019, and we are now heavily involved in the work coordinated by DG Grow, on developing EcoDesign measures for PV modules.\nThese are the tools, which after more than 5 years of intense work, are so far are being applied in Europe to assess the ‘imbedded carbon intensity’ of PV modules.\n2. Our understanding upon reading the CBAM inception impact assessment\nIn reading your document, we understood that the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) will most likely be the tool used to assess sectors and products worthy of a carbon border adjustment. The Commission’s document also seems to allude to the fact that ETS benchmarks will be used to assess what goods and products entering the EU market from third countries might be subject to this adjustment because their production process used more CO2 than it would have in the EU.\nWe would be grateful for some clarifications on this point, in order to ensure that this approach is neither incompatible with the work and expertise we have committed to the EU Eco-Design process, nor compromises the current carbon leakage protection provided under the ETS.\n3 Outstanding questions\nEU ETS benchmarks are not always representative of manufacturing sites outside of the EU, how will objective comparisons be made to assess what product require carbon adjustment and which to do not. How can effective efforts of separate industries in third countries, to reduce the CO2 intensity of their production, be considered? Embedded carbon calculation are based on an assessment of the average CO2 intensity of national energy mixes. These vary widely among EU member states with a different energy mix. In addition, significant differences in the CO2 intensity of energy mixes can also be detected within national borders of key competitive regions, depending on where production is located. How will this be taken into account to assess whether third country production is more CO2 intensive than that of the EU? What about CO2 emissions in other stages of the life cycle than the manufacturing stage (extraction, use, recycling...?) How will this be taken into account to assess which products are least emitting on a life cycle basis? The EU ETS applies only to large EU installations. What happens when third country installations qualify as large (over 2OMW combustion), but EU installations do not as they are below the size which incorporates them into the ETS? Would a CBAM be WTO compliant in this case? How do we ensure the CBAM does not impact the competitiveness of Solar as an energy source compared to other energy sources? An impact on the price of CO2 allowances, due to\nSolarPower Europe\nRue d’Arlon 69-71 - 1040 Brussels - Belgium - +32 2 709 55 20 info@solarpowereurope.org : www.solarpowereurope.org\nSolarPower\nEurope\nthe CBAM, will influence-the EU’s wholesale electricity market, and this in turn, could have a significant indirect effects on the cost of renewable electricity. We must also ensure that, in practice, the CBAM does not slow down the deployment of Solar energy on the EU market, such as by increasing the cost of PV system components such as aluminium, glass or polysilicon. In particular for the energy-intensive steps of the solar value chain that are regulated under the EU ETS, legal coherence must be ensured without compromising the current level of carbon leakage protection provided by free allocation and indirect cost compensation.\nFinally, there are several concerns related to the overall compatibility of CBAM within multinational frameworks (e.g. WTO) and European regulations (e.g. ETS). In addition to legal, methodological and technical challenges, the harmful impact of political trade retaliation measures should not be left outside the scope when assessing the functionality of CBAM\n4. Conclusion\nSolarPower Europe aims to be a constructive partner for the Commission. We are available to EU authorities should they need further information on the established methodologies to assess the embedded carbon emissions of products and their life cycle impacts.\nSolarPower Europe\nRue d’Arlon 69-71 - 1040 Brussels - Belgium - +32 2 709 55 20 info@solarpowereurope.org : www.solarpowereurope.org"

Through our innovations, we contribute to the EU 2050 target of climate neutrality. While the required transformation of chemical value-chains will need political and regulatory support, we consider it highly important that relevant policy instruments are undergoing a diligent impact assessment. This impact assessment should not only include one instrument (CBAM) but compare this with improving existing instruments like the ETS as well as with developing new policy measures. Furthermore, it needs to consider not only the legal but political impact on recently strained trade relations.\n\nType of policy instrument\nThe impact assessment should seek a broad evaluation of policy tools, including optimizing and strengthening those available e.g. free allocation in the ETS and indirect costs compensation, but also explore new approaches and recent ideas e.g. carbon contracts for difference or other systems which allow for cost pass through.\nIn this context, an impact assessment should consider both scenarios: \n•\tProtection is given, leading to increased cost for end consumers, but also for the industrial transition (steel, concrete for windmills or new low-carbon production plants …).\n•\tLimited protection due to green (allocated) imports resulting in lower consumer prices but a loss of competitiveness of energy intensive EU production.\nCompliance with international treaties/law is a must. The assessment should encompass legal, political and economic feasibility aspects of the different policy measures, including their acceptance by 3rd countries. This is esp. important for a mostly net export sector like chemicals with its globally integrated complex value chains.\nAlso, exports need to be protected from carbon leakage. Effects of both, carbon costs and higher costs of carbon free production in the domestic as well as export markets, must be part of the impact analysis. EU-based productions must be able to compete on a level-playing field basis in all markets.\n\nMethodological approach\nNorms for disclosing the carbon content of a product have been developed, but they allow for substantial discretion in allocation, e.g. by weight or by value. They do not provide a clear number for each product beyond doubt and may be challenged by trading partners. Even with a globally harmonized political agreement on allocation rules, data containing confidential business information (CBI) needs to be shared for transparency/verification reason. Effectively protecting CBI must be part of considerations.\n\nSectoral scope\nThe Commission intends to evaluate sectors subject to a CBAM with a focus on sectors with the highest risk of carbon leakage. However, the complexity of chemical value chains means that a CBAM cannot sufficiently be assessed by only looking at basic products but must consider the impact on all its downstream subsectors. It is important to assess how a CBAM in an import oriented sector may lead to retaliation measures in an export oriented sector. This intersectoral connection must be adequately considered. A policy measure must ensure protection of all strategic EU sectors and value chains. \n\nPreliminary assessment of expected impacts\nA positive impact of policy options on R&D and innovation to develop of low-carbon products will only be realized, if certain additional conditions are met. Developing breakthrough innovation for the production of low-carbon products will require additional financial support, which must, besides technology innovation support, also cover new applications and scale ups. It is therefore important that the assessment of a CBAM also includes the effects on clean-innovation production in the EU. The criteria of this assessment should be both protection and transformation of European industry. This will require including alternative instruments in the assessment.",

        "feedback": "The design and implementation of a border carbon adjustment (BCA) or alternative policy should be guided by policy objectives in light of the potential trade-offs. We believe that strengthening of climate actions by reducing carbon leakage is the main goal since the European Green Deal aims to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. We also see other important objectives, including the avoidance of social and economic harms, the limitation of legal and political risks, the minimisation of the administrative complexity and costs of avoiding carbon leakage.\nVarious trade-offs and challenges exist for the design options of a BCA or its alternative.\nA BCA could target imports only, or both exports and imports. It could be added to existing or future free allocation or become a stand-alone anti-leakage measure for sectors at risk. Export rebates or (even more so) a combination of free allowances with export rebates could raise red flags, given that they do not serve climate protection and could qualify as prohibited subsidies under WTO rules. If there is no global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions for both domestic consumption and production. An export rebate would necessitate a decision to create a level playing field for all European exporters on the international market or support low-carbon European exports only. Import adjustments, on the contrary, could potentially be designed WTO compatible.\nIf a BCA is to be implemented, the issue of how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the EU needs to be addressed. This could be resolved by choosing default values for a sectorial average. Default values avoid trade discrimination but would not be fully accurate. A leakage risk remains. Full calculations can avoid leakage but are administratively very difficult. Default values would help in operating a BCA, if a BCA is applied to only a few sectors, given that data on production technologies across the EU exist. Third-party certification could be used by producers abroad that perform better than the EU average. A clear trade-off exists regarding the scope of a BCA. If it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. However, a broad scope results in high administrative burden and methodological clarity.\nThe different treatment of products with a carbon-intensity higher than the EU’s average could be at odds with the WTO law and the national treatment principle. It will depend on the details of the BCA design. The trade-off is between environmental effectiveness, which can be achieved by stringent and ambitious forms of discrimination under a BCA, and WTO legality, which is more easily achieved by less effective formulations.\nThe exemptions from a BCA for countries based on their climate policy actions would need agreement on criteria. Country-based exemptions are difficult to reconcile with the WTO principle of Most-Favoured Nation. Country-specific settings of the BCA would require scrutiny. Granting credits if there is carbon pricing in the country of export, however, is a key element of a BCA design. Such credits for non-price–based policies pose challenges in how to calculate them.\nAn alternative to border measures exists. By combining an emissions trading system with a consumption charge on carbon intensive materials, the ETS would continue to provide incentives for climate-friendly production of materials. The combination of free allocation of allowances with a consumption charge levied on carbon-intensive materials sold in the EU allows for a carbon price signal along the value chain and addresses leakage, while avoiding the complexities of trade-related measures.\n\nPlease find attached our contribution to the public consultation process, titled \"Designing Border Carbon Adjustments and Alternative Measures: An Overview\", which provides a brief analysis of policy design considerations for a BCA.",

This was an invitation to discuss elements of a border carbon adjustment (BCA) and policy alternatives to support more ambitious EU climate policies under the Paris Agreement. Different ambition levels across Parties to the Paris Agreement, in particular the different carbon costs incurred for producers, can trigger carbon leakage — the outsourcing of emissions. Leakage is driven by trade and the international division of labour, such that imports whose carbon content is not subject to a carbon price can undermine domestic carbon-pricing efforts, and exports can lose market share in international markets. Consideration of a BCA is not exclusive to the EU. Major past and current federal carbon pricing proposals in the United States, for example, include BCA mechanisms. Emerging economies have also considered BCA: Mexico, for one, mentions them as an option in its nationally determined contribution — the regularly updated national climate policy pledges under the Paris Agreement submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThe European Commission’s Green Deal will lead to more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030. Meeting the long-term goal of climate neutrality by 2050 will entail a profound decarbonisation across all sectors of the economy. The carbon price will have to increase significantly, likely well beyond what we have seen in the past, raising concerns about carbon leakage. The European Commission is thus reviewing all its policy approaches, including the Emissions Trading Directive, the Energy Tax Directive and the anti-leakage approaches taken so far, predominantly in the form of free allocation of emissions allowances. The Green Deal is supposed to unlock investments to achieve climate targets, broadening the policy approach beyond climate action to enable deeper decarbonisation. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic downturn will likely result in surplus production capacities and may potentially exacerbate carbon leakage concerns.\nIn the following sections, we discuss the design options for a BCA and alternative measures that may be implemented behind the border. As part of this discussion we analyse the general policy objectives of BCAs and alternative measures, present an overview of different basic types of policy design,\n1 We will refer to the general tool BCA in this brief, because the term is widespread in the literature and policy debates. as a\n1\nhighlight various implications of design choices and shortly address further issues, such as the use of potential revenues, and practical implementation of BCA.\nThis overview of BCA and policy design consideration is based on the expertise of the authors and relevant literature. In particular, the work of Ismer et. al. (2020), Mehling et. al. (2019) and Cosbey et. al. (2019) and Neuhoff et. al. (2016) provides the framework of the subsequent discussion??*°.\nPolicy Objectives of a BCA and Alternative Measures\nAs the EU proceeds to elaborate a legislative proposal for the design and implementation of its BCA, it will be guided by several policy objectives. Clarity and transparency of policy objectives are critical for engaging with stakeholders within and outside the EU, for fostering broader understanding and acceptance of the measure and, importantly, for evaluating its performance and effectiveness following implementation. The tensions and trade-offs between competing objectives must be identified and balanced. Understanding the objectives of a BCA also allows policy makers to determine whether alternatives might be as effective but have lower economic or political cost or lower legal risk.\nStatements by decision makers and documents issued by the European Commission, including the Inception Impact Assessment roadmap, have variously mentioned the policy objectives of a future EU BCA or alternative measures. Whereas published documents have focused on strengthening climate action by avoiding carbon leakage®,statements by the EU and Member State officials — including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen— have also highlighted the need to avoid ‘unfair competition’ and ensure a level playing field for EU industry. Below we discuss these and additional aims that should guide the design and rollout of an EU BCA.\nStrengthening Climate Action\nFirst and foremost, the chosen policy should strengthen climate action. As will be elaborated below, focusing on this objective is vital for reducing the risk of legal challenges by trade partners. A BCA can potentially strengthen climate action in several ways, such as:\n- by limiting emissions leakage from the relocation of production and investment to non-EU countries with no or less restrictive carbon constraints, which may then supply the EU and global markets with higher carbon-content products; by ensuring full internalisation of carbon costs along the value chain to incentivise efficient material use and substitution with less carbon-intensive materials, and to create a business case for climate-neutral but likely higher-cost production processes; by creating incentives to reduce the carbon content of imported products by subjecting the emissions associated with their production to the EU carbon price; by enabling the EU to sustain greater climate ambition by alleviating domestic pressure from stakeholders concerned about the economic consequences of carbon leakage;\n2R.

That risks portraying the BCA as an economic rather than an environmental measure, potentially rendering it more vulnerable to challenges under international trade law (see also below). Nevertheless, these social and economic concerns are legitimate and play an outsized role in domestic policy debates. Where it occurs, emissions leakage also threatens economic opportunity. Affected companies worry about losing market share to foreign competitors,® while citizens worry about offshoring of jobs. Vulnerable industries are often concentrated in structurally disadvantaged regions, where industry relocation due to climate constraints can result in further loss of social cohesion.\nLimiting Legal and Political Risks\nAs the EU considers the design of a BCA, it needs to consider the policy’s legal basis, which in turn depends on the chosen mechanism. If it is designed as a fiscal measure, the BCA would most likely require a unanimous vote in the European Council, rendering its passage less likely. Implementation through an extension of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), on the other hand, would allow passage by a qualified majority vote. What is more, because a BCA will be imposed on imports and/or exports, it risks infringing on the EU’s commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and some regional trade agreements. In particular, restrictions on imports based on the carbon intensity of products may violate provisions on non-discrimination, and policy relief or exemptions for European producers could be seen as a prohibited subsidy under the WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Careful design and emphasis on the environmental objectives of the BCA can minimize these risks. Finally, the BCA is likely to incite heated political controversy by the EU’s trade partners. Past proposals to adjust for uneven climate policies have been followed by quick and ardent criticism from other countries, and the announcement of a BCA as part of the European Green Deal has likewise evinced censure from other countries. Such diplomatic fallout has the potential to undermine multilateral cooperation, including under the climate regime, and makes a case for both the design and rollout of a BCA to engage the trade partners in a fair, transparent, and inclusive process.\nMinimizing Administrative Complexity and Cost\nDepending on its design, the implementation of a BCA can incur considerable technical challenges and necessitate data that may not be available across the EU. Using default values for entire sectors rather than requiring calculation of emissions for each individual product, for instance, can reduce some complexities but also reduces the accuracy of the BCA as a tool to internalise the carbon cost of covered products. Likewise, a BCA that seeks to maximise its climate benefit would have the broadest possible scope, including basic materials as well as intermediate and final goods, yet their inclusion dramatically increases technical complexity, potentially raising the cost of implementation beyond the\n8 In this context, it is worth noting that BCA imports only will not, by itself, safeguard the competitiveness of EU products sold in a on foreign markets.\nclimate benefits. Navigating such trade-offs between objectives is an important consideration for the policy’s designers.\nBasic Types of BCAs and Alternative Measures\nPolicy measures to reduce or eliminate carbon price differences between domestic producers and their international competitors can take several forms. Each type of arrangement is characterised by a different combination of domestic production and consumption coverage, as well as the extent to which the adjustment covers import and exports.\nThe most straightforward option to reduce carbon price differences between domestic and international producers is to introduce instruments directly targeting trade flows — that is, border carbon adjustments, which can cover either imports only or both imports and exports. Import adjustments can take the form of a charge, or alternatively imports could be included in the EU ETS. Both policies have similar effects: domestic consumption of a given type of good is fully covered by carbon pricing and therefore also covers imports. The extent of BCA coverage (raw materials, intermediate goods, final goods) is a specific design choice discussed in the following section. An import BCA can be complemented by export adjustment, although this arrangement may be challenging from the WTO law perspective. It can take the form of direct costs refunds associated with the EU ETS (purchase of allowances) for the exported goods. In that case, full export adjustment will be achieved without any penalties or benefits associated with emissions intensity of the EU exports.\nAlternative mechanisms can limit carbon cost differentials for domestic and international producers without the introduction of border instruments. The current solution in the EU ETS is to provide free allocation of emissions allowances for domestic producers, with the number of allowances declining over time. It is at best a temporary measure and not a permanent solution to mitigate carbon price differentials between domestic and international producers. Instead, providing continuous free allocation that is linked to actual production volume ensures that the carbon price differential between domestic and international producers is limited over the longer term. If this so-called dynamic free allocation is based on product benchmarks, domestic producers are charged for emissions above the benchmark and rewarded for outperforming it. This means that: a) the carbon price signal is maintained for all domestic production; b) the cost burden for domestic producers associated with climate policy is reduced in both domestic and international markets; c) producers that outperform the benchmark receive a net benefit; and d) the carbon price signal for domestic consumption is largely muted. This last feature of dynamic free allocation is problematic from the perspective of overall cost-efficiency of climate mitigation, but it can be addressed by introducing an additional consumption charge based on product benchmarks for domestic consumers.\nThe final way to equalise the carbon prices faced by domestic and international producers is to completely switch from a production-based to a consumption-based carbon pricing scheme. This would involve excluding domestic producers from the EU ETS and instead introducing consumption charges based on the product’s carbon footprint. The approach is economically equivalent to introducing BCA for both exports and imports, but in practice tracing emissions from consumption is more technically and legally demanding than from production.\nTable 1 summarises the trade-offs associated with measures to address cross-border carbon price differentials.\nTable 1.

In the following, we briefly discuss the implication of design elements such as product coverage, default carbon intensity values, exemption and credits and continued free allocation.\nProduct Coverage\nThe coverage of a BCA must be evaluated across production chains and across material choices. Carbon-intensive basic materials serve as primary feedstock to the production chains of most manufacturing processes. In our globalized economy, production chains are heavily integrated with markets outside the EU, and manufacturers of intermediate products are often in direct competition with companies based abroad. Flaws in the BCA policy design might have disruptive effects on the domestic manufacturing sector while not achieving the goal of reducing the carbon footprint of imports. If only raw material imports are covered, end-product manufacturers may choose to procure intermediate products from non-EU manufacturers that are not affected by the BCA in their raw materials choice. A BCA that applies to a wide range of intermediate products with carbon-intensive material content, however, might impose a heavy administrative burden. Policy design should also address the dynamics of material substitutions. A static definition of raw materials covered by the legislation could favour the use of carbon-intensive alternatives that were not envisioned when the regulation was drafted. Although such material substitution may play a minor role for capital goods, the policy design needs to prevent unsustainable substitutional effects for intermediate and final goods.\nDefault Carbon Intensity Values\nObtaining actual carbon emissions data for every imported or exported product is infeasible.? A practical approach is to set a default emissions intensity value to calculate the level of adjustment at the border. These defaults may be uniform by product (such as the domestic sector’s average emissions intensity or an average of the top performers, or the best available technology) or differentiated according to the country or origin (such as for indirect emissions), production technology category, or a facility’s actual emissions. Table 2 summarizes the many trade-offs amongst accuracy, incentives, political, legal and administrative issues that are involved when choosing default values; notably, these trade-offs can be different for import adjustments than for export or production rebates.\nBasing the default value on a uniform measure can reduce legal and political risks, but such values may not accurately reflect the actual emissions intensity — especially when domestic intensity targets are ambitiously low. Uniform sector defaults for imports are thus less effective at transmitting carbon price signals. However, for export rebates, uniform defaults are less distorting than firm- or technology-specific rebates, which either exempt a portion of a firm’s actual emissions from carbon pricing or give larger de facto subsidies to dirtier producers. On the other hand, from a legal perspective, any rebates in excess of a firm’s actual carbon payments may be viewed as illegal subsidies, so uniform rebates cannot be too generous.\nFor imported goods, accurate transmission of carbon price signals requires appropriate differentiation, and foreign firms will have incentives to reduce their footprint only if such action translates into a smaller border adjustment. However, such differentiation increases complexity, requires extraterritorial information and risks legal challenges and trade conflicts. One solution is to combine uniform default values with an option for importers to reduce their border adjustments if they can demonstrate that their specific production process is more carbon efficient, such as by third- party certification in accordance with internationally recognised standards. As domestic emissions fall, a movement from default values based on domestic intensity towards defaults reflecting a global average emissions intensity will enhance effectiveness of the BCA and may aid in linking different systems internationally.\nIn the case of consumption charges, default carbon intensity values should be consistent with the benchmarks used for determining free allocation to domestic producers, which are in effect uniform standards.\n° To maximise leakage prevention and incentivise mitigation incentives, the of emissions used for emissions intensity values should scope include total emissions — that is, both direct and indirect emissions from electricity. However, including indirect emissions would increase feasibility, by reducing complexity and data requirements, as well as political and legal issues e.g. due to existing compensation mechanisms for indirect emissions in some member states.\nTable 2.

Cross indicates adverse effects.\nExemptions and Credits\nExemptions and credits are features unique to a BCA regime: neither would feature in a regime based on consumption charges.\nExemptions are country-based carve-outs from the application of a BCA. Such a feature presents two challenges. First, it would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)’s Article | (Most- Favoured Nation) and could be implemented only by invoking GATT’s Article XX (General Exceptions). Second, it is not clear what criteria would be appropriate for exemptions. Some have proposed that least-developed countries be exempted, and this may align with the UNFCCC principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). Other possibilities:\n- Exempt countries that are on track to meet their Paris Agreement commitments. However, those are voluntary commitments of widely varying ambition, and they are hard to verify. Exempt countries that have an emissions trading system with a hard cap, since no leakage can occur if the cap is adequate.\nAny such exemptions would be best specified in terms of objective criteria, and not left to executive discretion.\nCredits are adjustments to the amount owed for an imported product, based on an assessment that the product was subject to carbon pricing in the country of export. Absent such crediting, BCA and consumption-based charges both tilt the playing field to the detriment of the imported product, effectively double-charging for its carbon content. If the credit is for a carbon price—based policy in the country of export, the adjustment is more or less straightforward: a reduction in the amount payable, equal to the calculated carbon price already paid, whether that was in the form of a carbon tax or a mandated purchase of allowances. It is more challenging to grant credit for policies not based on price, such as automobile efficiency standards, because it is difficult (but not impossible) to calculate the price-equivalent effect of any policy and to keep abreast of changing standards. More fundamental is the challenge of deciding which policies to consider; many climate policies are not explicitly aimed at mitigation.\nContinued Free Allocation\nAllowances are allocated for free to industrial installations in the EU ETS. This limits carbon cost increases that could trigger relocation of production or investment to countries with lower carbon costs. In the EU, allocation is based largely on product benchmarks, thereby creating incentives for producers to improve production efficiencies.\nFour types of distortions from free allocation of allowances persist:\n- Incentives to innovate and invest in breakthrough low-carbon technologies and processes may be limited, since their deployment will lower the benchmark level (which is based on the best performers) and thus decrease the firm’s ability to recover incremental costs associated with climate-friendly new processes and receive carbon leakage protection for existing assets. Today’s production volumes will be the basis of the calculation of free allowance allocation in future years (production volume times benchmark level). This creates incentives to increase production and sales volumes and thus reduces carbon cost pass-through. With uncertainty about the level of carbon cost that can be passed through in product prices, a politically negotiated free allowance allocation could exceed the carbon costs left with producers, which would result in windfall profits. With limited carbon cost pass-through, the incentives for substitution with less carbon- intensive materials and efficient material use are limited. Furthermore, the business case for investments in (near) climate-neutral production processes is undermined if final consumers will not pay carbon costs and or the incremental costs of low-carbon alternatives.\nBCAs may offer, from an environmental and fiscal perspective, an opportunity to abandon free allocation of allowances, thus avoiding the first three distortions mentioned above and limiting the fourth. It has also been proposed to combine a BCA for an (unlimited) transition period with free allowance allocation. In that case, the level of the adjustment charge would need to be reduced by the level of free allocation to avoid discrimination. To the extent that a share of free allocation would be retained, all four environmental and fiscal concerns persist.\nIf, as an alternative, the EU ETS were complemented with a consumption charge at the benchmark level, then free allowance allocation would be reformed to be directly proportional to current (or the previous year’s) production volumes and the benchmark level for conventional processes. This would mute carbon cost pass-through from the EU ETS, other than for inefficiencies above the benchmark level. The full carbon cost pass-through would, however, be reinstated with the consumption charge.\nThus, all four distortions would be avoided, and the environmental and fiscal objectives would be achieved.\nOther issues\nThe practicality of a BCA or alternative measures depends on the other policy design aspects that must be considered thoroughly before their implementation. The use of potential revenues and the mechanism of implementation for a BCA are briefly discussed in this section.\nUse of Revenues\nBoth a BCA and consumption-based charges will generate revenues that may be used for various purposes. We envisage four major potential uses: a) substituting for other taxes (in the framework of a green fiscal reform); b) compensating households with direct financial transfers; c) financing low- carbon technologies or projects within the EU; and d) extending these financing options to developing countries. The allocation will need to be determined based on a political economy rationale, which may include efficiency, distributional fairness and equity (domestic or global) and overall emissions reduction aspects. This rationale may also vary depending on the policy option chosen.\nAn important issue here is that, depending on the policy option chosen, the revenues may be collected by the EU directly, or by the Member States, hence affecting how they are used. Also note that the chances that any BCA is ‘saved’ by the GATT’s General Exceptions are greatly increased if the revenues are directed to environmental purposes, and even more so if they are directed to international climate-related efforts that might benefit affected trade partners.\nMechanism of Implementation\nDifferent policy mechanisms can be drawn on to implement a BCA, and the Inception Impact Assessment roadmap highlights three options: a carbon tax on imported and domestic goods, a customs duty and the inclusion of imports in the EU ETS. Each mechanism faces different legal requirements for its adoption and implementation, including voting requirements under the EU law, implications for revenue use and likelihood of violating international trade disciplines.\nConceptually and administratively, implementation by way of a tax or duty may be the most straightforward yet difficult to adopt politically: measures that are primarily fiscal — such as a tax — require unanimity in the European Council and are thus easier for individual Member States to block, whereas customs duties may require the renegotiation of existing tariff arrangements under the WTO or regional and bilateral trade agreements. Implementation by way of an extension of the EU ETS would require only a qualified majority vote in the European Council but raises complex administrative challenges, from aligning with the EU ETS cap or creating a separate pool of virtual allowances to correlating the adjustment level to the variable market price of the EU ETS allowances.\nGenerally, the mechanism of implementation should adhere as closely to the mechanism faced by domestic producers, to reduce the risk of challenges based on GATT’s national treatment provisions. Because the EU producers are subject to the EU ETS as the main decarbonisation policy, BCA implementation should require importers or foreign producers to either purchase allowances to cover their emissions or pay a levy based on the market price of allowances. Alternatively, importers or foreign producers could be allowed to purchase international carbon offsets or emissions allowances from other established markets with clear emission caps up to the determined value of the adjustment. To avoid problems of unpredictable swings in prices, importers should be afforded the same compliance timeframe as domestic firms.\nConclusion\nThe design and implementation of a border carbon adjustment or alternative policy should be guided by policy objectives in light of the potential trade-offs. We believe, strengthening of climate action by reducing carbon leakage is the overarching goal, given that the European Green Deal aims to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. We also see other important objectives, including the avoidance of adverse social and economic implications of such action, the limitation of legal and political risks, and minimisation of the administrative complexity and costs of addressing carbon leakage.\nIn sum, the following trade-offs and challenges exist for the design options of a BCA or its alternatives.\nTo tackle leakage, a BCA could target imports only, or both exports and imports. It could be added to the existing or future free allocation of emissions allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage, or it could become a stand-alone anti-leakage measure for sectors at risk. Export rebates or (even more so) a combination of free allowances with export rebates could raise red flags, given that they do not serve climate protection and could qualify as prohibited subsidies under WTO rules. As long as there is no single global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions caused both by domestic consumption and production. An export rebate would necessitate a decision to either create a level playing field for all EU exporters on the international market or support low-carbon EU exports only. Import adjustments, on the contrary, could be designed in a way that is potentially WTO compatible.\nIf a BCA is chosen, how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the EU becomes an issue. This could be resolved in part by choosing default values for a sectoral average. The default values, while avoiding trade discrimination, would not be fully accurate, thus leaving room for leakage. Full calculations can avoid leakage to a large extent but are administratively very difficult to implement and may face legal risks under WTO law. Default values would help in operating a BCA, in cases where the BCA applied only to a few sectors (instead of all traded goods), provided the data on production technologies across the EU exist. Third-party certification could be a solution for producers abroad to get credit if they perform better than the EU average. A clear trade-off exists regarding the scope of producers covered. If it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. However, a broad scope comes with high burdens for administration and also methodological clarity.\nThe different treatment of products with a carbon-intensity value higher than the EU’s average could be at odds with the EU’s WTO obligations, in particular the national treatment principle. But the details of the scheme clearly matter. The trade-off here is between environmental effectiveness, which can be achieved by stringent and ambitious forms of discrimination under a BCA, and WTO legality, which is more easily achieved by less environmentally effective formulations.\nThe exemptions from a BCA for countries based on their climate policy actions would need a clear agreement on criteria. Country-based exemptions are difficult to reconcile with the WTO principle of Most-Favoured Nation. The country-specific settings of the BCA thus would require scrutiny. Allowing for a credit if there is carbon pricing in the country of export, however, is a key element of a BCA design. Granting credits for non-price—based policies poses difficult challenges as to how to calculate them.\nAn alternative to taking measures at the border exists. By combining an emissions trading system with a consumption charge on carbon intensive materials, the EU ETS would continue to provide incentives for climate-friendly production of materials. The combination of free allocation of emissions\n10\nallowances with a consumption charge levied on carbon-intensive materials sold in the EU (for both imported and domestic materials) allows for a carbon price signal along the value chain and addresses leakage. It also avoids the complexities of trade-related measures.\nThe European Commission will need to review options for a BCA and alternatives keeping in view other climate policy instruments, as it seeks to develop a consistent and robust policy framework that can guide the Member States to climate neutrality.\n11"

        "pdf_text": "ECUADOR\nFeedback\nto the\nCarbon border adjustment mechanism\nApril 2020\nI Introduction: the importance of banana industry for Ecuador’s development and EU- Ecuador partnership objectives\nThe European Union (EU) is one of the most important partners for our product?: in 2018 the European market represented the biggest share of our sales, 32,5% of total’.\nBanana industry produces more than 3 billion USS in Ecuador. It represents the second most exported product, just behind oil. It is a national scale economy that involves other sectors: paperboard, plastics, logistics, etc. It is considered an “ice breaker” economy: banana industry reaches new ports around the world for other Ecuadorian products to find a market there. It creates 250.000 direct jobs, and more than 30.000 indirect ones.\nConsidering the importance of banana industry for Ecuador’s economy, the amount of jobs that it creates, the environmental, economic and societal projects that it involves’, the Ecuadorian Banana Cluster plays an important role within the framework of the current EU-Ecuador FTA, being fully committed as a reliable partner to achieve the objectives stated on the Title on Trade and Sustainable Development.\nTherefore, it is of crucial importance that the EU takes into consideration in its Impact Assessment the consequences that a Carbon Border Adjustment Measures (CBA) may have in Ecuador’s social and economical development.\nIl. How CBA should be designed\nAs initially suggested by the European Commission’, one of the main objectives of the EU with the CBA is to ensure European companies do not have competitive disadvantages compared to companies from countries with lax climate regulations, and to prevent companies from simply moving carbon-intensive production to third countries to avoid the EU's environmental standards (also known as carbon leakage).\nThe objective of the CBA is to allow the EU to pursue ambitious climate objectives to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the Earth’s atmosphere, whilst ensuring that domestic efforts do not simply serve to drive production and GHGs emissions elsewhere.\nHowever, absent a revenue redistribution policy, the adjustment cost will ultimately be borne by the final consumer (in the EU) according to their consumption habits. Therefore, measures must be put in place to ensure that the tax is socially just and does not disproportionately impact low-income households.\nAdditionally, the risk of carbon leakage is still being debated in research’, i.e. the risk that without the CBA, EU climate regulations might create perverse incentives for more imports from countries outside the EU which might be harming the environment, climate and rights.\n1 “Assessing the economic impactof the Trade Agreementbetween the European Union and Ecuador”, European Commission, available at: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/september/tradoc 154964.pdf\n2 According to ACORBANEC statistics: http://www.acorbanec.com/\n3 https://www.followmetothefield.com/es/\n4 “Mission Letter of Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy”, 1 December 2019, available at:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/sites/comm-cwt2019/files/commissioner_ mission letters/mission-letter-paolo-\n\ngentiloni_en.pdf\n5 “A European carbon border tax: much pain, little gain”, Bruegel, 2020, available at: https://www.bruegel.org/2020/03/a-european- carbon-border-tax-much-pain-little-gain/\n& \"A Proposition for Multilateral Carbon Tax Treaty”, T. Falcao, 2019, IBFD Online Books. a\n7 Like-product is the WTO terminology to designate similar product. a\nIn this paper we do not undertake to assess climate impacts of this tool. Instead, this paper should be seen as a complementary analysis of socio-economic impacts to accompany analysis from a climate perspective.\nWe consider that, if eventually the EU will design the CBA, it should be guided by the following principles:\n1. Global environmental benefit: a CBA should be designed with global climate, environment and social objectives at its core, and should be flexible and nuanced enough to avoid causing perverse incentives in other countries that ultimately lead to more harm.\n2. Policy Coherence for Development: a CBA should be coherent with development policy objectives and avoid any negative impact on the economies of developing countries, including via flanking measures.\n3. Equity: acknowledging the EU’s climate debt towards developing countries, as early industrialized countries have already consumed most of the global carbon budget and must undertake steeper emission reductions to keep the planet under 1.5°C of average global warming.\n4. Existing EU-Ecuador bilateral commitments: special approach towards the multilateral FTA, in order to encourage the existing obligations assumed between parties and consider impact on tariff-free access to the EU market.\n6. Fairness and progressivity: considerations of progressivity must be applied to both the exporting developing countries as well as importing EU countries, to ensure the CBA does not create an additional, disproportionate burden on low-income households in Europe nor negative impacts on jobs and inequality in Ecuador.\nIl. Carbon adjustments and WTO\nThe WTO is responsible for regulating when a border adjustment is admissible and when it is not through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For carbon border adjustments to be admissible, the tax applied (or credited) must be applied on both foreign and domestically produced products. The tax cannot unduly burden a foreign derived product. Moreover, the tax can only be applied on a product, not a process (also referred to as ‘taxes occultes’ or hidden taxes under WTO rules)®. Taxes occultes are not admissible under WTO regulations.\nIt follows from the above that, under WTO regulations, the following requirements are necessary for a carbon border adjustment to be admissible:\n1 An equivalent tax ought to be applied on a like-domestic product’. The concept of equivalence requires the tax rate of the national product and the imported product to be similar, so that no undue burden is applied on the foreign derived product in sucha way that it might constitute a hindrance to trade. The tax must be levied on a product and not a process. Carbon taxes would therefore be admissible if employed both domestically and at the border, but the same might not hold\ntrue for energy taxes (if they apply in the production process, not to the finished product) — although a conclusion cannot be reached until the details of the policy are revealed.\nA key challenge for the carbon border adjustment intended by the EU is whether it will be a mechanism able to differentiate between the environmental impact of products produced in different ways, or whether it will only be able to recognize whether the import is burdened by a domestic carbon tax in the exporting country.\nIV. Carbon footprint of the banana supply chain®\nThe calculation of a carbon footprint of a product is the sum of all materials, energy and waste across all lifecycle activities thereof, multiplied by emission factors and global warming potentials (GWPs). The carbon footprint of the banana industry is spread across the entire value chain, which can be divided into three broad steps: production and packing, transport and shipping, and ripening (for exported bananas). However, it is relevant to point out that only 15%-20% of world banana production is traded globally (the biggest banana producing countries such as India or Brazil export very little and keep most for domestic consumption).\nISO 14064 standard on quantification of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases represents a fundamental instrument for the estimation of carbon footprint in banana companies. ISO standards 14040 and 14044 on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and PAS 2050 Carbon Footprint Verification (published by the British Standards Institution) provide a recognized framework for carbon footprint and lifecycle analysis.\nHowever, the results can vary considerably depending on the chosen methodology, scope and boundaries, and because every study needs to be adjusted to local conditions and emission factors. For example, some carbon footprint studies take into account the steps of land use change and consumer transport and wastage in the calculation scope. Within the evolving field of carbon footprint, calculation methodologies are multiple and still under construction to fit with growing expectations.\nDespite bananas being an important product, only few carbon footprints analyses have been published, and the results have varied depending on the methodology and data: from 324g to 1.124kg CO2e/kg of bananas.\nAlthough they defined different boundaries, banana carbon footprint studies have identified maritime transport (including refrigerants) as the main contributor to the banana supply chain carbon footprint, followed by the manufacture and use of fertilizers and the manufacture and preparation of carton boxes in packing stations.\nThese aspects should be taken into consideration when designing CBA for banana import from Ecuador.\nV Potential impact on developing countries\nA carbon border adjustment would be a tax levied at the border at a price that is commensurate with the carbon tax (or price) being applied domestically. An EU-wide carbon border adjustment would either (i) be commensurate with the cost borne by companies under the ETS; (ii) correspond to the carbon tax applied by each EU Member State (if the policy allows for different States to employ different tax rates); or (iii) be commensurate with a potential EU-wide carbon\n8 “Carbon Footprint of the Banana Supply Chain”, 16842EN/1/02.17, FAO, World Banana Forum, available at: http://www. fao.org/3/a-i6842e.pdf\nVi Conclusion\ntax, introduced into the common area. The objective of such a policy is to provide cost parity between the domestically produced and the imported product, so that they are both negotiated at equivalent prices within the EU common market, and so that domestically produced products are not disproportionately affected by the domestic tax.\nThe EU might consider granting a carbon border adjustment exemption to countries administering equivalent carbon taxes. Should the EU tax rate be higher than in partner countries, a partial exemption from the tax could be administered in the EU, corresponding to the rate employed in the third country of origin. Under a partial exemption system, the carbon border adjustment rate would correspond to the EU tax rate minus the rate already employed by the third state. The overall result would be to assess the carbon border adjustment at the full EU rate, while avoiding double taxation.\nWith or without these exemptions, an EU carbon border tax may have an impact on developing countries in many ways:\n1 As products imported from developing countries might become less competitive than they are at the moment for the EU market if a carbon border adjustment is introduced, this could result in lower exports to the EU, with potential negative impacts on jobs in those countries if flanking measures as part of a just transition are not in place. Secondly, the carbon border adjustment would apply to goods from all countries, even the least developed countries. This does not take into account the Paris Agreement recognition that developing countries have differentiated responsibilities, as they have historically contributed far less to global emissions than early industrialized countries. While the EU should support an alternative development pathway, the EU should also respect the policy space of the countries in question, as well as international commitments in the area of climate action, finance and development. The EU could consider exempting least developed countries from a CBA or returning all proceeds from the CBA applying on imports from developing countries to those countries for their own budgetary needs. An additional concern is that the CBA, if it can only be adjusted down if exporting countries already implement a carbon tax or price, could in fact act as a penalty on developing countries for not having their own carbon tax. This ignores the fact that there are various legitimate reasons why some developing countries may have decided not to implement a national carbon tax, including fairness and equality concerns at domestic level - and that they might have more suitable policy options for supporting a just transition (for example, better royalties regimes on extractives). Carbon taxes, when poorly designed, can be regressive and have disproportionate impacts on people living in developing countries.\nBased on our analysis of potential impacts on developing countries, we conclude that, if the EU does decide to go ahead with a CBA, it must thoroughly consider in the Impact Assessment the following challenges:\n1 Is the CBA an effective tool to discourage carbon leakage or high GHGs in countries exporting to the EU? Are there other measures that could be more effective, e.g. import standards regulations?\nVil. Our requests\nIs the CBA able to recognize and adjust when other national policies, practices or regulations beyond domestic carbon prices and taxes have led to reduced GHG emissions and benefits to the environment? Finding the right balance between respecting developing countries’ policy space, export needs and the EU’s policy coherence for development principle. How to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalized by higher prices on essential products? Social considerations will need to be taken into account to ensure that the cost of the carbon tax does not disproportionately fall on lower-income households, especially for products for which there are no sustainable alternatives currently available and accessible to them. Can the revenues from the CBA be used in a fair way? The revenues accumulated in Europe via the CBA when imposed on products imported from developing countries could be transferred back to the countries concerned for their own budgetary goals, in order to strengthen their domestic resource mobilization for financing of public services such as housing, education, health, environmental protection, or a just transition.\nTo consider in the Impact Assessment:\n1. The social and economic consequences that a CBA may have on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) commitments assumed in the EU-Ecuador FTA. The feedback on this issue from the sixth Sub-committee on TSD of the EU-Ecuador FTA. The potential negative impacts on jobs in Ecuador. The complexity of defining a clear single methodology to assess the carbon footprint of the banana supply chain. The potential negative impact on low-income households in Europe when purchasing such an essential and affordable product as banana is. All additional multilateral commitments, namely WTO and Paris Agreement."

        "feedback": "***Proposal for an innovation-conscious CBAM***\n\nIf a European carbon border adjustment mechanism is to support energy-intensive industries on their transition to a low-carbon future rather than to simply protect them from a tilted playing field, the instrument should be structured in a way as to set the right incentives to innovate.\n\nOn the the one hand, the EU should use its existing research and funding frameworks (Horizon Europe, Innovation Fund, InvestEU, European Regional Development Fund, Connecting Europe Facility) to support research, demonstration and roll-out of low-carbon technologies such as CCS, electric or hydrogen furnaces or alternative building materials.\n\nOn the other hand, the CBAM proposal should include a \"sunset clause\", i.e. a fixed duration or at least transparent conditions for its phase-out, to signal that protection to European industries will only be temporary. Setting a fixed end date for the CBAM reduces the policy uncertainty that is currently delaying necessary investment into new production technologies in the cement, steel or aluminium industries. The \"stick\", or \"pull-factor\", of a phase-out on the horizon would complement the \"carrot\", or innovation push, provided by research funding, and unlock the creative capacities of European companies to enable them to become innovation leaders, as the European Green Deal envisions it. \n\nThe CBAM could then be framed as a measure to accompany European industries in their transition rather than to protect them. The duration should consequently be based on expert assessment of the time necessary to transition to low-carbon production in key energy-intensive industries. \n\nIn terms of political economy, a transparent end date or phase-out conditions would signal to industry that any delays in investment and any lobbying efforts to ease internal regulation would only harm their long-term viability in a post-CBAM world, and thereby avoid moral hazard. \n\nAs a co-benefit, a time-limited CBAM would signal to the international community that EU intends to move to global carbon pricing without border adjustments in the long term. Several academic proposals in recent years (Cosbey et al., 2012; Mehling et al. 2019) foresee a sunset clause for this latter reason. ",

        "pdf_text": "HVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nEU GREEN DEAL ON STEEL\nEU CLIMATE LEADERSHIP REQUIRES WATERPROOF CARBON LEAKAGE MEASURES\n~\na af\"\nvi\nAO\nAh\n~\nA\n=\nWHY A CARBON BORDER MEASURE NEEDS TO COMPLEMENT TEMPORARILY FREE ALLOCATION AND INDIRECT COSTS COMPENSATION IN THE TRANSITION TOWARDS CLIMATE NEUTRALITY\nThis paper clarifies the reasons why it is appropriate from environmental, economic and legal perspectives to implement initially a carbon border measure as a complementary provision in addition to the existing carbon leakage measures.\nThe EU Green Deal is a landmark for the EU leadership in the international fight to climate change. The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association"

While the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) Mechanism could be an important tool ensuring that imports “reflect more accurately their carbon content”, it must be accompanied by an equally effective carbon price within the EU. With the CBA set to tackle carbon leakage, it must be acknowledged that current levels of carbon leakage are minimal, and any potential future threat hinges on increased asymmetries in global climate ambition levels and carbon prices. Although a CBA could be an important tool in such a context, incentivising global climate ambition levels, it cannot be seen as a silver bullet.\n \nIn the context of the EU ETS, a CBA is preferable to the current system of free allowances. It is important to note that free allowances cannot operate together or in conjunction with a CBA on the same products. It would either result in not being WTO compliant through double protection of domestic industry, or reduce its effect as any benefit derived from free allowances would also be extended to imports.\n \nAs the current threat of carbon leakage is minimal, free allowances under EU ETS are resulting in windfall profits rather than protecting against actual carbon leakage. As a result, the current system may in fact contribute to steering investments away from the EU, in particular from decarbonisation efforts. In the upcoming revision of the EU ETS, Bellona Europa strongly recommends that the European Commission complete a full phase-out of free allowances, introduce a price floor and ensure a strengthened and dynamic Market Stability Reserve (MSR) to account for market developments. Although a proposed CBA on imports can be an enabling tool for global climate ambition, it is not sufficient on its own.\n\nA CBA mechanism must therefore be accompanied by a comprehensive policy package incentivising low carbon investments, production and consumption within the EU. This must include a portfolio of measures including market drivers for uptake of clean products. Bellona Europa urges the European Commission to include a thorough assessment of all available policy options and tools in the upcoming impact assessment, including the introduction of product standards. Above all, any CBA or policy influencing the treatment of imports must be for climate and not protectionism.\n \nThe aims below must be at the heart of any potential CBA for it to deliver. If not, a CBA on imports risks being nothing more than a vaguely disguised protectionist measure where global climate ambition and emission cuts are secondary targets.\n \n1.

In turn facilitating further sustainable investment and growth as outlined in the European Green Deal, and also in line with the “just transition for all”.\n\nLastly, a CBA must take “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” into account, and resulting revenue should be earmarked to reach set the aforementioned aims, with a particular focus on Least-Developed Countries (LDC).\n",

Considering the necessity of a CBAM creation does not imply that CAN Europe agrees with the notion that our industry suffers from carbon leakage, as this is still largely unproven. If a CBAM is to be implemented  this would need to be complemented by an immediate and total cancellation of all free allowances currently distributed to high emitting industries in the ETS. Indeed, free allocations have resulted in windfall profits for industries and a distorted carbon price signal without addressing the fact that some imports of unrestricted products can undermine the overall EU climate protection effort.\n\nb. CAN Europe support the concept of the externalities of products so that products reflect their ‘true costs’, including for goods imported into the EU. The EU’s inclusion of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in its European Green Deal and new Industrial Strategy shows the intentions of the European Commission to consider the design and implications of such a mechanism. As such, this could be a first step in ensuring that products (including those from outside the EU) reflect their truer costs by integrating at least a carbon price into a given product.\n\nc. However, there is still a lack of data availability in the current international system to determine the carbon content of some products, including those of heavy industry, making it difficult to determine a payment value based on the carbon content of a given product.

The effort involves extensive discussions with former US government officials, trade lawyers, associations and academics. \n\nEmission Measurements: Voluntary, international guidelines have been widely used for decades by firms in energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries to measure GHG emissions from facilities. Results are compatible with regulatory procedures that exist in many nations. More recently, voluntary guidelines have been developed to evaluate the GHG footprint of products. The challenge is to allocate emissions from facilities to the products they create. Our framework describes a Greenhouse Gas Index (GGI) as an administrative tool to evaluate BTAs based on a GHG tax. Products with GGI of at least 0.5 tonnes CO2e per tonne of product would be eligible for export rebates and subject to import charges. The threshold covers commodity products of major EITE industries. These approaches form a foundation to develop regulatory procedures for BTAs. The effort would benefit from public-private partnerships with industry and other stakeholders.\n\nExport rebates: European manufacturers compete in both domestic and export markets with firms from nations with less stringent GHG controls. Both markets should be addressed to alleviate competitive damages and GHG leakage. CBAM should consider establishing rebates for domestic exports as well as charges on imports.\n\nChallenges to WTO Compatibility:\n\n•\tDifficult and likely insurmountable barriers to WTO-compatible BTAs exist, if import charges are not based on a domestic tax on like products. BTAs that offset regulatory procedures such as the EU-ETS do not appear to be compatible with current WTO rules and practice. Even if they were compliant, such proposals face difficult methodological challenges to evaluate an “equivalent cost” to assign to imports. The ETS applies to facilities, not products, and its price setting process results in a variable not a fixed price. While methods described above might assist in translating the price from facilities to products, they do not provide a solution to the variable price.\n\n•\tThe Most Favored Nation principle of WTO requires that import BTAs be assigned on the same basis for all nations. Import charges cannot be adjusted to provide credit for the various domestic policies of exporting nations. This is fortunate since objective methods do not exist to determine the equivalent price to assign to imports from the wide variety of nations that export to the EU with vastly different policy portfolios and stringency. \n\nKey points from our observations are: 1) methodologies exist that could provide a basis to assign GHG emissions from facilities to the GHG-intensive products that they produce, 2) without a domestic tax on GHG-intensive products it will be unlikely to create WTO compatible approaches to BTAs.\n\nDr. Brian P.

Introduction\nDiscussions regarding policies to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been ongoing for decades, and GHG policies of various types have been implemented for years in many countries. In practice, countries that adopt GHG policies utilize a portfolio that typically includes a mix of standards, subsidies, mandates and price-based policies, each directed at particular economic sectors. In view of obvious inefficiencies and lack of synergies resulting from the portfolio approach, economists and many others have convincingly argued that setting a price on carbon—and other GHG emissions—using an economy-wide, upstream GHG tax would be the most effective and efficient policy to address GHG emissions. Its effectiveness stems from being able to cover all emissions from production and use of fossil fuels by applying the tax on producers of coal, oil, and gas resources at the mine mouth and wellhead before they are combusted, rather than dealing with actual emissions from millions of individual sources and actors throughout the economy. Its efficiency stems from allowing markets, rather than the political process, to identify and implement the most cost-effective steps to reduce emissions through decisions that affect current operations and purchases, and through decisions now about investment, research and development to invent and deploy more effective solutions to reduce future GHG emissions.\nMyriad issues must be addressed to design and approve legislation to implement an upstream, economy-wide GHG tax. This report does not address that galaxy of challenges and opportunities. Rather, assuming that an upstream GHG tax could be\n1 Compendium: WTO-Compatible Methodologies to Determine Export Rebates and Import Charges for Products of Energy-Intensive, Trade-Exposed Industries, if there is an Upstream Tax on Greenhouse Gases, Jan W. Mares and Brian P. Flannery (forthcoming).\nwww.rff.org | 1\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\nimplemented, the report addresses the challenge of border adjustments for exports and imports in the context of a domestic upstream GHG tax, as described below.\nThe domestic GHG tax could cause energy-intensive industries to shift production to countries without comparable pricing, resulting in “leakage” of GHG emissions that the domestic tax aims to prevent. By shifting production from the United States, the tax would also disadvantage domestic manufacturers, their employees, and the communities where they operate. Hence, the call by many to introduce border adjustments: through the imposition of equivalent GHG pricing on imported products from energy- intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries, and by providing rebates from the impact of the upstream tax on the cost of products exported by domestic producers. However, doing this has raised concerns about consistency with rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nHere we propose a Framework for a US climate policy with border adjustments that are compatible with US obligations under WTO agreements. It is based on an upstream tax on GHG emissions with rebates for exports and charges on imports for products from EITE industries. A companion Compendium! (forthcoming) provides additional details on implementing border adjustments with specific recommendations for 35 EITE industries. Proposed border measures are designed in a non-discriminatory fashion, with the intent and effect of reducing global GHG emissions. Therefore, the border adjustments proposed as part of the Framework will not give rise to any valid claims of WTO violations. Even if such\nclaims should be raised, a strong defense could be made under the exceptions to the WTO rules.\nIssues in the design of border adjustments for internationally traded products also bring into focus the distinctly different roles and practices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the WTO. While climate policies have the potential to create trade disputes, if they occur, they will be resolved through the WTO, which has the authority, experience and tools to resolve them, not through the UNFCCC, which does not. To avoid lengthy, potentially divisive battles between trading partners striving to fulfill commitments to two independent international institutions, it would be desirable to formulate domestic climate policies that are compatible with both WTO and UNFCCC obligations. However, as addressed in countless scholarly papers, this, particularly compliance with WTO obligations, can be complicated.’ In particular, proposals that argue for trade remedies based on environmental exceptions under the WTO, (e.g., to prevent GHG leakage), would not be allowed if they resulted in arbitrary discrimination or disguised restrictions on trade.\nIn what follows: Section 2 sets the scene with background and additional details on the current state of the international climate regime under the Paris Agreement; Section 3 provides an overview of the proposed Framework and issues to address for WTO compatibility; Section 4 describes some common cross-cutting elements that affect many sectors, e.g., how to treat electricity, cogeneration and recycling; Section 5 illustrates how the Framework applies to EITE sectors including some that present unique\n2 See Addressing Competitiveness Concerns in a Carbon Tax: What Are the Options?

A companion Compendium to this report is forthcoming and will provide an overview with detailed discussion of the application of the Framework to oil and gas production, coal production, oil refining and electricity, and modules of varying length for 31 other EITE sectors.\nThis discussion does not address the merits or political challenges of gaining support for an upstream tax on US GHG emissions or how revenues would be used. We note that revenues would be significant even at levels under discussion to initiate such a tax and they would grow significantly over time if the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement were to be met. Though smaller, sums involved in rebates for exports and those imposed on imports would also be significant. Rebates would likely reduce income from domestic revenues by at least $20 billion per year. These estimates are dominated by fossil fuel resources and products. They would vary considerably from sector to sector. The Framework makes no proposal for how the import charge should be collected or used. It seems reasonable to assume that it should be collected with other charges on imported products, entered into US general revenue and, if directed, used for the same purposes as revenue from the domestic GHG tax.\n2. Scene Set\nThe seeds of this challenge were planted in the 1980s as nations began to consider how to frame international cooperation to address climate change. While developed nations realized that domestic climate policy could decrease economic growth and affect their international competitiveness, developing nations voiced far greater concern that\nwww.rf.org | 2\ndomestic and international climate policies could hinder their overriding priorities for economic development and poverty alleviation, and adversely affect trading relations. Consequently, developing nations insisted that the UNFCCC incorporate Principles (see Article 3) to limit adverse outcomes. Articles 3.1 (common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities: CBDR-RC) and 3.5 highlight the challenge for trade and climate.\n3.1 The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof. 3.5 Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.\nCBDR-RC played a significant role in both the UNFCCC (1992) and, later, the Kyoto Protocol (1997), both require only developed nations to take commitments to limit GHG emissions. Despite enormous changes in geopolitical and economic circumstances since 1990, efforts by developed nations to evolve to a less stringent approach to CBDR-RC have been only partially successful, and challenges to trade remain.\nToday, trade and climate concerns not only persist, they proliferate. Under the Paris Agreement (2015) pledges for national action prolong (at least through 2030) and reinforce differences among nations both in stringency and types of policies they use to limit GHG emissions. In this respect, challenges exist not only between developed and developing nations, but also from growing differences\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\namong developed nations (as highlighted by withdrawals from the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period, and recently by the announced intention of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, possibly contingent on further developments). Important differences also exist that create challenges among developing nations. If, in pursuing the very ambitious long-term goals of the Agreement, some nations increase ambition over time more than others, then trade tensions may escalate as effects for specific sectors and nations become clearer and more pronounced.\nIn the United States and most developed nations, GHG emissions occur primarily as carbon dioxide (COz) from combustion of fossil fuels. In the United States, energy- related CO2 emissions account for over 80 percent of total GHG emissions. While overall economic impacts of climate policy today may be small for nations like the United States with large, diversified economies, they can be much greater in specific sectors and regions, and in nations where exports of fossil fuels and energy-intensive products play a major role (e.g., OPEC nations, Russia, Canada). This is especially so for EITE industries, that include oil & gas, chemicals, steel, aluminum, cement, plastics, and paper.\n3. Overview of the Framework\nThere are several elements to the Framework. They include: Section 3.1 methodologies to determine GHG emissions from facilities and operations of EITE industries and, as described here and in the Compendium, to allocate them to specific products; Section 3.2 issues to be addressed to be compatible with WTO; Section 3.3 descriptions of the upstream GHG tax and associated rebates for products that are exported and charges on imported products; Section 3.4 WTO rules and border tax adjustments (BTA), a deeper dive; Section 3.5 specification of EITE industries and information to be reported; and Section 3.6 border adjustments determined in a manner analogous to the familiar value-added tax\nwww.rf.org | 3\n(VAT), but here applied to cumulative GHG emissions. (To avoid any confusion: note that the upstream GHG tax itself is not a VAT. The value-added concept uses cumulative GHG emissions as an administrative index to track costs generated by the upstream GHG tax as they flow through the economy to affect downstream suppliers, producers and customers.)\nAs described in Section 3.2, in the United States and other nations that adopt it, this proposal would fundamentally shift the focus of efforts to mitigate emissions connected to international trade from a system based on where goods are produced to one where they are consumed.\nThe Framework covers not only CO2 but also emissions of other significant GHGs covered by US regulations. These include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20), HFCs, PFCs and SF6, which can be especially important for some sectors. Regulations provide factors? that denote the contribution of each gas relative to CO2 by weight. This allows the GHG tax (in US$ per tonne CO2) to be applied to the full set of emissions expressed as tonnes CO?-equivalent (CO2e).*\nThroughout the discussion it is important to recognize distinctions between existing GHG policies and methods that address and apply to emissions from facilities and operations of manufacturers—in the context of GHG taxes, cap-and-trade systems, and emissions reporting—rather than the perspective required in this Framework for border adjustments that apply to specific products of firms in EITE sectors. This requires two extensions beyond current\n3 The UNFCCC and most nations set these weighting factors based on the 100-year Global Warming Potential as published and updated from time to time by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, regulatory updates may lag those by IPCC.\n4\nTo be consistent with the large number of international papers in this field, we have chosen to denominate weight in metric tonnes (1 tonne equals 1.102 short tons).\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\npractice: first, to specify how GHG emissions from upstream suppliers and on-site operations contribute to determine cumulative GHG emissions required to produce products; and second, to determine how GHG emissions from entire facilities (and operations) can be apportioned to the products they produce.\nThe Framework addresses these issues by defining an index for the cumulative GHG emissions of specific products manufactured in a specific facility in an EITE industry—a greenhouse gas index (GGI).° GGI for products from specific manufacturers includes contributions from: 1) inputs (GGI) from products purchased by the manufacturer from suppliers in EITE sectors, 2) process GHG emissions (if any) from on-site operations of the manufacturer, and (3) upstream producers of oil, gas and coal products include a third contribution to GGI from the carbon content of produced fossil resources. The carbon content of produced fossil resources is determined at the wellhead for oil and gas and at the mine mouth for coal—the contribution from contained carbon is converted into CO2 emissions under the assumption that 100 percent of the carbon will be emitted as CO2 upon combustion by downstream users. These contributions embody an approach analogous to that used in VAT: here based on following GHG emissions that occur along the supply chain to produce and, in the case of the carbon content of fossil fuels, the tax is prepaid for administrative convenience before later combustion of fuel products. Following cumulative emissions provides an effective administrative tool to track the economic impact of the upstream tax on downstream\n5 In light of further exploration of this topic in the accompanying Compendium (published in October 2018), we have decided to use this term and related shorthand, GGI—a switch from the acronym used (PCGE) throughout the originally published version of this Framework report in March 2018. This file has been updated to reflect the change throughout.\nwww.rf.org | 4\nusers. While the GHG tax is paid only for process emissions from any sector and for the carbon content of fossil resources, the economic impact of the tax flows through the chain linking suppliers, producers and customers to affect the entire economy. GGI is a useful administrative tool to follow added costs of products that suppliers charge their customers (based on applying the GHG tax rate to GGI).\nIn this Framework, products to be exported would be eligible for rebates determined by the rate (in US$ per tonne of product): (GGI) times (GHG tax). For imported products, GGI (as determined for foreign producers) provides the basis for the import charge by applying the US GHG tax (see Table 1). This is discussed further immediately below in general, and for specific sectors at length in Section 5 and with examples for many EITE sectors in the Compendium (see footnote 3).\nThe Framework determines rebates for exported products and charges on imported products using the same approach for both. When a specific manufacturer in an EITE sector transforms products from many suppliers into new products, they must reallocate the total cumulative GHG emissions from all inputs plus GHG emissions from on- site operations (if any) to the determine cumulative GHG emissions (GGI) for products they produce.\nTo manufacture products, EITE industries (by definition) require energy and other energy-intensive inputs, notably electricity and commercial fuels in all sectors, and, in some sectors, other energy-intensive materials such as electrodes, oxygen, and hydrogen. When electricity or energy 1s derived from fossil fuels, GHG emissions result as a byproduct. To be clear: utilizing energy from fossil fuels requires a chemical transformation of the hydrocarbon bond through the addition of heat and oxygen: emissions of CO2 occur as an inevitable byproduct. Indeed, in some limited commercial applications CO? is separated from flue gas and sold as a product.\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nSeveral sectors generate additional GHG emissions from extraction and processing of resources, for example from calcination of lime and from venting, flaring or leaks of associated gas produced during extraction and processing of natural gas and crude oil. Emissions depend heavily on the particular natural resources, commercial energy sources and technologies used to create inputs from suppliers and manufacture products. GHG emissions in a given sector can vary considerably not only between firms, but also across domestic facilities and operations of a given firm, depending on their specific circumstances.\n3.1. Methodologies to Determine GHG Emissions\nCentral to our proposal is the concept that rebates for exported products and charges on imports from EITE firms and industries can be determined based on information available from regulatory reporting procedures which exist in many nations, or international guidelines that have been developed and endorsed by many EITE industries. These methods were developed to determine emissions from facilities and operations (e.g., power plants, chemical plants and oil fields). Today, in the United States and many other nations, they provide an established foundation that underpins systems for GHG emissions reporting, taxation and allowance requirements in cap-and-trade systems.\nOver the past two decades many industrial sectors, especially EITE sectors, have also developed voluntary GHG measurement and reporting guidelines that have been endorsed by international industry associations (e.g., see\nwww.rf.org | 5\nWRI/WBCSD GHG Protocols).° Their development involved collaboration with non- governmental organizations and interactions with government regulators. These guidelines are widely used by firms to roll up and report corporate GHG emissions from facilities and activities around the globe, e.g., in Corporate Annual Reports and as a basis for voluntary submissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project. The methods undergo ongoing scrutiny and are revised and updated from time to time. Those involved from industry interact with regulatory authorities around the world as they develop and revise “official” procedures. Methods account for operational emissions (often referred to as Tier 1) from activities to produce natural resources (e.g., to extract and process coal, oil and gas) and manufacturing activities to produce specific products or product slates including from the use of commercial fuels. They also account for indirect emissions, e.g., from purchased electricity (Tier 2). After many years of experience including regular interactions between industry, government and non-state actors, methodologies required by regulatory processes and the voluntary guidelines adopted by EITE industries yield consistent results,’ although they are often tailored to different boundaries and accounting in different settings. They are available for use by firms in any nation, and firms that export EITE products are typically multi-national companies with the expertise and capacity to utilize these guidelines in nations without regulatory protocols.\nMethodologies and issues will be discussed in greater detail below, and in Section 5 and the Compendium where we consider specific sectors. For rebates and import charges, available methods for entire\n6 Through the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) work with businesses to develop standards and tools that help companies measure, manage, report and reduce their carbon emissions. http://www.ghgprotocol org\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\nfacilities must be extended: first, to accumulate GHG emissions from the entire supply chain to produce products, and second, to allocate the share of emissions assigned to specific products of a given producer’s facilities. In general, we find that it is possible to estimate these emissions without having to examine details for every step in the sequence to manufacture each product. The first few, very energy-intensive steps usually account for the vast majority of GHG emissions emanating from a particular facility or manufacturing chain. Once those are accounted for, emissions for final products can be allocated using simple rules, e.g., based on the carbon content of the processed fuel, or average emissions per unit weight of precursors incorporated in the final product, e.g., raw steel transformed to bars or pipes. In this respect, the approach is analogous to the logic of applying border adjustments only to EITE industries with significant emissions, rather than to exports and imports from all sectors and their products, e.g., automobiles and laptop computers. This restricted focus serves the dual environmental and administrative goals of reducing GHG emissions to limit risks from climate change while also limiting administrative costs and complexity.\nWhile it will be possible to identify the firm responsible for producing exported or imported products, it may be difficult and even counterproductive to identify the facility where specific products originate. For example, fuels distributed in a pipeline may originate from different refineries of many companies, and a given manufacturer may produce identical products in several plants that utilize electricity from sources based on renewables, nuclear, gas or coal. US exporters\n7 Mark A. Cohen and Michael P. Vandenbergh (Energy Economics 34 (2012) S53—S63: The Potential Role of Carbon Labeling in a Green Economy.\nwww.rf.org | 6\nwww.rf.org | 7\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\ncountries that have not yet implemented detailed GHG regulatory reporting requirements for industrial activities.\n3.2. Issues in WTO Compliance\nOur approach to border adjustments for products from EITE industries is based on providing a rebate for exports by US manufacturers and applying a charge on imports from foreign firms. Both the rebate and import charge are determined by applying the US GHG tax rate (in $ per tonne CO2e) to GGI: Cumulative GHG Emissions resulting from process emissions during production and (in the case coal, oil and natural gas) the carbon content of the produced resource.\nThe border adjustment process has been designed to satisfy several criteria:\ne Rebates and import charges are determined in the context of the indirect domestic tax on GHG emissions associated with the product; Import charges are applied without discrimination based on national origin; Objective international standards are used to determine domestic rebates for exports and border charges on imports; Rebates for products do not exceed the amount of the indirect domestic tax; Import charges on products do not exceed the amount of the indirect domestic tax on like products.\nwould have an incentive to claim rebates for products sourced from their most GHG- intense plants, while foreign firms would be assessed lower import charges if they could claim that exports to the United States originated from their least GHG-intensive facilities. To avoid “gaming” that might be done in these cases, and in recognition of the lack of clear provenance in many cases, we propose that products exported by US companies should be assigned emissions based on the average for the firm’s entire domestic production of that product, or, if specific firm averages are not available, then based on the average for the entire US sector. Similarly, we would assign emissions for imported products based either on the average emissions for that product across the entire sector in the country of origin, or across the entire company if such information is available.\nNational GHG inventories required by the UNFCCC provide another official source of information on GHG emissions that may be useful in this context. These inventories, based on guidelines® produced and updated from time to time by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), include information for many sectors and activities. However, they do not extend to emissions from particular facilities or firms. Nonetheless, they provide national information that would be especially valuable to help estimate average emissions for products in many EITE sectors in developing\n8 See http://www. ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/index.html. The development of the new Methodology Report to refine the current inventory guidelines (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories), is being carried out by the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFT) in accordance with the decision taken at the 44th Session of IPCC in Bangkok, Thailand, in October 2016. The final draft of this new Methodology Report titled “2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” (2019 Refinement) will be considered by the IPCC for adoption/acceptance at its Plenary Session in May 2019.\nwww.rf.org | 8\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nnon-discrimination on the basis of national origin of imports.\nIf adopted, the Framework proposed here could cause other countries to consider whether and how they might provide relief (from their own national GHG policies) to firms that export to the US. Indeed, if the United States adopted this approach it might encourage other nations also to adopt the more efficient GHG tax as a basis to facilitate exports to the United States and other nations that adopt this approach.\nAs stated above, for the United States and other nations that adopt it, in essence, this proposal fundamentally shifts costs to mitigate emissions connected to international trade from a system based on where goods are produced to one where they are consumed.\n3.3. Upstream GHG Tax with Border Adjustments for Exports and Imports\nIn the US, but not in all nations, the majority of GHG emissions (over 80 percent) occur as CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels. However, if the ultimate objective is to achieve radical, long-term reductions that have been proposed as the goal of GHG policy, other sources, such as cement production, and other gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, must also be addressed. Indeed, the upstream GHG tax should also apply to activities that generate significant GHG emissions, such as land use change, that are not EITE sectors.\nIn our Framework, the direct statutory incidence of the upstream tax falls only on a few EITE sectors: producers of coal, oil and natural gas and a few others, but all sectors experience its economic consequences based on their use of fuels, electricity and, in some cases, other energy-intense inputs such as oxygen and hydrogen. For example, besides paying the upstream GHG tax, producers of coal, oil and gas would pay more for the electricity, commercial fuels and other energy- intense inputs they use to extract and initially process fossil resources. As key downstream\nWTO tules allow nations to provide rebates for the cost of indirect taxes on products and to apply a charge to imports that is not in excess of the indirect tax on domestic producers. This Framework does not address environmental exceptions under the WTO, but we believe that it should be compatible with them—this will be addressed in a companion report. The environmental exceptions cannot be used if, in fact, border adjustments were implemented in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or that is a disguised restriction on trade. Arguments have been made that some procedures proposed and even implemented to address border issues in some nations jeopardize their WTO compatibility.\nTo apply equally to all nations this approach does not take account of GHG policies, regulations and costs already imposed in the exporting nation—which differ enormously among nations that trade with the US. While this runs counter to many discussions of border adjustments, it also has advantages. In particular, it is extremely difficult to assess the actual cost of GHG policies in many nations, let alone their cost to specific products. No nation yet applies the economist’s ideal policy—and the one assumed in this proposal—of an economy- wide tax on all GHG emissions: an actual GHG “price.” Most nations, including the US, utilize a portfolio of policies that include a variety of mandates, subsides, and end-use efficiency regulations, as well as some price- based approaches. Cap-and-trade systems result in a variable, volatile, unpredictable GHG price on the facilities in some sectors. Evaluating the cost of these policies for specific products gives rise to a quagmire of challenges. It would be exceedingly difficult, for example, to determine the amount of a cap-and-trade credit appropriate to reduce the US import charge on products exported from a country with a cap-and-trade system that includes substantial allowances for various EITE industries. Such credits run the risk of violating Most Favored Nation principles of\nexamples, electricity producers would pay no GHG tax, nor would refiners pay a GHG tax on crude oil they process, fuels they produce, or electricity, commercial fuels, and other energy-intensive materials they utilize. Nonetheless, because of the upstream tax, refiners would pay more for crude oil and natural gas, and power plants for fossil fuels that they utilize. Consequently, their customers—including upstream producers of oil, gas and coal—would pay more for purchased fuels and electricity (see Figure 1)\nDetermining precisely the economic impact of the upstream GHG tax on the price producers charge their customers may be an impossible task, since prices in commodity goods fluctuate from day-to-day for many reasons. Nonetheless, as a policy for GHG regulation, in analogy with VAT, we require that producers determine and pass through to their customers GGI (tonnes CO2e per tonne of product and tonnes COze per MWh for electricity) for products they sell. In this framing, it is important to distinguish between the GHG tax paid by those EITE manufacturers that emit GHGs in their on-site production processes (and producers of coal, oil and gas for the carbon content of produced resources) and the amount eligible for rebates to all EITE firms that export. The latter includes both the GHG tax (if any) paid by the producer of exported products, and also the cumulative GHG emissions GGI passed- through the supply chain leading to products purchased by the manufacturer, e.g., from purchased coal, crude oil and natural gas, electricity, commercial fuels and energy- intensive materials they use. GGI builds up over the supply chain in a straightforward analogy to similar methods used for VAT as described in Section 3.6 below.\nUpstream GHG Tax\nOnly a few EITE sectors, notably coal, oil and gas producers, directly pay the GHG tax; this section focuses on them. The Compendium discusses a few other sectors, e.g., cement, aluminum and steel that would also pay the direct tax because they emit CO2\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nfrom processing limestone or alumna or consuming electrodes. Because the carbon content of fossil fuels is taxed before combustion, no tax is paid at the downstream point of emission from use of commercial fuels to produce electricity or for other purposes. The tax is prepaid on the carbon content of fossil resources as they are produced at the mine-mouth for coal and wellhead for oil and gas. Process emissions subject to the GHG tax also occur from upstream operations to produce coal, oil and gas during extraction and initial processing of the natural resources, for example, from venting or flaring of associated gas and fugitive emissions from leaks. Unlike border adjustments that must be defined for specific products, the upstream GHG tax applies to process emissions from entire upstream facilities and operations, and to the carbon content of produced fossil resources.\nAn offset fee, paid at the same rate as the GHG tax, would be available to manufacturers who capture CO? emissions from fossil fuels and permanently store them as part of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) operations. “Permanent” storage will be defined by permitting procedures for CCS that will have to address the potential for leakage over periods ranging from centuries to longer. The Framework could also provide an offset fee for fossil resources that are converted into durable products like concrete. As with “permanent” for CCS, that would depend on setting agreed criteria for “durable.”\nRebates for Exported Products\nThe methodologies described above (Section 3.1), provide objective information to assess GHG emissions from facilities and operations in EITE industries, and to consolidate results to determine firm or sector- wide average emissions. In the United States, such information has been available for many years and provides a basis to levy the upstream GHG tax. To determine rebates for products we must extend the methods by allocating cumulative GHG emissions from all inputs and operations of entire facilities to the\nwww.rf.org | 9\nproducts they create. In situations, such as a steel mill or petroleum refinery, where a plant produces an entire slate of products, it is often appropriate to allocate emissions based on the tonnage of products produced, or on their carbon content in the case of processed fossil fuels. The Compendium discusses more complex circumstances that occur in sectors where facilities produce multiple products using a variety of technologies and processes that require separate approaches. In any case, existing methods can be extended to provide information to determine how facility-wide emissions and cumulative GHG emissions from suppliers would be apportioned across the portfolio of products they produce—although this almost certainly will require effort by firms, trade associations and regulators to develop appropriate, agreed information and procedures in EITE sectors, as discussed below.\nThe Framework calls for the use of firm- wide or, in the absence of firm-wide data, sector-wide national averages to determine the amount of a potential BTA. The firm-wide average avoids concerns with provenance of products or firms shifting sourcing for domestic sales and exports to maximize rebates or reduce import charges (as described in Section 3.1), it appears to be more appropriate to use domestic averages for an entire firm. This requires the firm to roll up average cumulative emissions GGI for their domestic production of each exported product. Because of the large variety of production methods employed in many sectors, and the regional variation of emissions associated with sources for purchased electricity, it seems appropriate to use firm, not sector averages to determine the domestic rebate for specific products. To meet WTO criteria, it is essential that the rebate for exported products does not exceed the value associated with cumulative GHG emissions of producers (US GHG tax times GGI for the product). Firm-wide averages could simplify the issues associated with provenance of exported products.\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nNote that, even at a modest starting level of $20 per tonne COz, the scale of domestic GHG taxes, export rebates and import charges would be very significant. With respect to taxes on fossil resources, in 2016 US energy- related CO2 emissions (approximately 5.2 billion tonnes CO2) would have yielded revenues of 100 billion US$. Exports, on the other hand (using a simple estimate—based only on carbon content, not a complete analysis of cumulative GHG emissions and only for petroleum products) of crude oil and other petroleum liquids in 2016 amounted to just over five million barrels per day, and imports to about 10 million barrels per day— with trends showing exports rising and imports falling. Export rebates in 2016 would have been about 20 billion US$ and import charges 40 billion US$. Thus, responsible administrative agencies would be processing domestic taxes, rebates and import charges of many billion US$ per year.\nBorder Charge on Imported Products\nIn this Framework, both the charge on imported products and the rebate for exported products are determined in the same fashion based on objective, accepted methodologies that do not discriminate against any nation, nor favor domestic producers over imports. The charge for products of a given firm would be assessed on exported products based on the national average for emissions GGI (in COze per tonne) from the entire domestic production of that product by the firm, or on the national average for the entire sector if firm-specific averages are not available. As described above in Section 3.1, a variety of internationally accepted methodologies exist to determine GHG emissions and they are essentially similar in their provisions. Moreover, many, but not all, nations have already implemented regulatory requirements to report GHG emissions by EITE industries. The same approach applied to US domestic manufacturers in a given sector, would be used to allocate emissions to their product slate, yielding COze emissions per tonne of product exported to the US.\nwww.rff.org | 10\nwww.rff.org | 11\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\npaid on similar products that are sold for domestic use.\nThe border adjustment of the upstream GHG tax on imports and exports of products from EITE sectors could raise concerns about potential violations of the rules of the WTO. The WTO’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) prohibits countries from providing export subsidies for their products. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) restricts the ways in which WTO-member nations impose taxes on imported products. Both agreements, however, follow the “destination principle,” which permits taxes to be border adjusted on products based on where they are consumed rather than where they are produced.? Moreover, both agreements permit the “downstream” border adjustment of an “upstream” internal tax on products so long as the tax 1s designed and implemented in a nondiscriminatory manner. Accordingly, a properly designed GHG tax would be permissible under the relevant rules of the WTO.\nBorder Adjustment of the GHG Tax on Exports\nAlthough the SCM Agreement generally prohibits export subsidies,!° the prohibition does not apply to the rebate of taxes imposed on “like” domestic products that are consumed domestically.!! Annex I contains an “TIlustrative List of Export Subsidies” that includes “(g) the exemption or remission, in respect of the production and distribution of exported products, of indirect taxes in excess\n10 See SCM Agreement, Article 3.1 (prohibiting subsidies contingent on export performance).\n11 See SCM Agreement, n.1 (“the exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for domestic consumption, or the remission of such duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued, shall not be deemed to be a subsidy.”’)\nThe border charge would impose the US GHG tax rate to products imported from other nations based on cumulative GHG emissions (GGI) required to produce them, and, in the case of fuels, to combust them. To avoid issues associated with determining (or shifting) the provenance of produced goods, emissions would be determined based on the company’s average for products manufactured in the exporting nation. If company-specific information is not available for an exporting company, then average data for the entire exporting country would be estimated and used to create import charges. Estimating and assigning emissions to imported EITE products (e.g., default national averages or values for specific production processes and commercial fuel and electricity use) will be central in determining the import charge for such products.\n3.4. WTO Rules and Border Tax Adjustments (A Deeper Dive)\nThe rules of the WTO permit internal taxes and charges to be “border adjusted” — i.e. rebated on exported products and applied to imported products. Significantly, BTAs need not be imposed or rebated directly on the product that is subject to the domestic tax, but may also be imposed or rebated on manufactured goods that incorporate the product—including energy inputs—that is subject to the domestic tax. BTAs on imports and exports, however, may not exceed the tax\n9 See WTO Secretariat, Taxes and Charges for Environmental Purposes — Border Tax Adjustment, WT/CTE/W/47, para. 36 (2 May 1997)(“WTO provisions on border tax adjustment follow the destination principle for [product based] taxes’’), available at\nhttps://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S0O 09-\n__\nDP.aspx?language=E&CatalogueldList=6608&Current CatalogueldIndex=0&FullTextHash=&HasEnglishReco rd=True&HasFrenchRecord=True&HasSpanishRecord =True.\nof those levied in respect of the production and distribution of like products when sold for domestic distribution. a”\n“Indirect taxes” are defined broadly to cover essentially all taxes on products, including “sales, excise . . . value added, transfer... and all taxes other than direct taxes and import charges.”!? This provision indicates that the remission of taxes on fossil fuels “used in the production and distribution” of exported EITE products would be permissible so long as the remission was not “in excess of” the taxes levied on products if they were sold for domestic use.\nParagraph (h) of Annex I even more explicitly permits rebates of taxes on energy inputs into exported products with regard to “prior stage-cumulative indirect taxes” (PSCI taxes).!3 “Cumulative” indirect taxes are defined as “multi-staged” taxes that are not credited at subsequent stages of the production process.!4 PSCI taxes may be remitted if they are “levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product....”!5 Inputs that are consumed in the product process include not only inputs that are\n12 SCM Agreement, n.58.\n13 Footnote 58 defines “prior-stage” indirect taxes as “those levied on goods or services used directly or indirectly in making the product,” which would describe taxes on fossil fuels used in making EITE exported products. The inclusion of taxes on services indicates that there is no requirement that the prior stage tax be levied on goods that are physically incorporated in the exported product.\n14 SCM Agreement, n.58.\n15 SCM Agreement, Annex I, (h). para.\nwww.rff.org | 12\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\n“physically incorporated” into the exported product, but also “energy, fuels and oils used in the production process....”!6 Accordingly, depending on how an upstream tax on fossil fuels was structured, it could be rebated on downstream exported products from EITE sectors under paragraph (g) or (h) of the SCM Agreement so long as the export rebate is not “in excess” of the taxes paid upstream.\nHere, the proposed structure of the domestic tax—applied both at the wellhead or mine mouth on coal, oil and gas (and therefore paid by upstream producers) and applied to (and paid by) the limited number of EITE industries that emit COz2 in their production process—raises a number of complications regarding the export rebate. With respect to the upstream tax on coal, oil and gas, the complication is raised by the fact that rebates are permitted for taxes “borne by the product” while the EITE products will only indirectly bear the tax through increased costs for electricity produced using coal, oil or gas. Moreover, because the tax is paid once at the wellhead or mine mouth, difficulties may arise in demonstrating that the tax is “cumulative” for purposes of falling under the permission\n16 SCM Agreement, n.61. The An earlier version of the SCM Agreement—the 1979 Subsidies Code—permitted export BTAs for PSCI taxes only when the taxes were imposed on inputs that were “physically incorporated” into the exported product. The relevant language in paragraph (h) was modified during the Uruguay Round negotiations to permit the remission of taxes on inputs—including energy and fuels—that were “consumed in the production of the exported products.” The change was made in response to a proposal by India, which argued that permitting the rebate only of taxes on physically incorporated inputs “places at a disadvantage countries with multi-stage cumulative tax systems vis-a-vis those with value added tax systems [covered under paragraph (g)] as in the latter, there is no impediment to the exporter collecting full credit for all prior stage taxes paid on inputs.” WTO Secretariat, Negotiating History of Footnote 61 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, para. 10, WT/CTE/W/16 (Dec. 1, 1995).\nprovided in paragraph (h) of Annex I.!7 However, the concern of these provisions is to ensure that subsidies are not hidden through rebates for unseen inputs. It will thus be critical to structure the export rebate in a transparent manner and to ensure that the amount of the rebate does not exceed the amount of the charge effectively imposed on domestic products.\nBorder Adjustment of the GHG Tax on Imports\nThe GATT similarly permits border adjustment of internal taxes on imported products. Article II of the GATT restricts the imposition of customs duties (tariffs) on imported products to the rates specified in schedules annexed to the GATT.!8 Under Article II:2, however, a charge “equivalent to an internal tax” imposed on a competitive domestic product may be imposed on an imported product or, significantly, on “an article from which the imported product has been manufactured or produced in whole or in part.” Thus, GATT Article II:2, like the SCM Agreement, permits the border adjustment of prior stage taxes on inputs to products that are traded internationally.\nArticle II] of GATT similarly recognizes the ability of governments to border adjust on imports taxes that are imposed on inputs used in producing competitive domestic products.\n17 Cumulative taxes generally thought of multi- are as stage taxes levied where there is no mechanism for subsequent crediting of the tax if the goods or service subject to the tax at one stage of production are used in a succeeding state of production. See, A. Hoerner and F Muller, Carbon Taxes for Climate Protection in a Competitive World, prepared for the Swiss Federal Office for International Economic Affairs (June 1966), at 36.\n18 See GATT Article II:1.\n19 Under GATT Article II:2, charges levied imported on products must be imposed “consistently with the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article III...”\n20 GATT Article III:2 (emphasis added).\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nBTAs pursuant to GATT Article II:2 must comply with Article III:2,!9 which states that imported products “shall not be subject, directly or indirectly, to internal taxes or other internal charges of any kind in excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to like domestic products.”2° The reference to taxes imposed “indirectly” encompasses taxes on “raw materials used in the product during the various stages of its production.’”’2! As with export BTAs under the SCM Agreement, imports BTAs under GATT may not be imposed in a discriminatory manner—1.e. “in excess” of the taxation imposed on like domestic products.?2\n3.5. Specification of EITE Industries and Information to be Reported\nThe concept of EITE industries has existed for some time, but it remains unclear exactly how they should be defined, and systems differ between nations with different GHG policies. Nearly a decade ago, H.R. 2454 (the Waxman-Markey Cap-and-Trade legislation) included criteria to determine US industrial sectors eligible for relief in international trade under that cap-and-trade proposal and based on GHG emissions from facilities and operations, not products. An interagency task force led by EPA then identified 46 sectors”\n21 Japan—Customs Duties, Taxes and Labelling Practices on Imported Wines and Alcoholic Beverages, L/6216 - 348/83, para. 5.8 (adopted on 10 November 1987).\n22 If import BTA held to be inconsistent with an were GATT Articles I or III, it could still be permissible under Article XX, which provides exceptions for measures that are “necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health” (XX(b)) and measures “relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources . . . “ (XX(g)). A discussed above, however, properly a designed BTA should be permissible without recourse to Article XX.\n23 The Effects of H.R. 2454 International on\nCompetitiveness and Emission Leakage in Energy-\nwww.rff.org | 13\nwithin the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that were presumptively eligible.\nThe Framework here requires additional information from EITE sectors beyond what was required for H.R. 2454, and requires information from additional sectors to track cumulative GHG emissions from producers to their products across the entire supply chain. Consequently, the Framework includes Oil & Gas Production, Petroleum Refining, Coal Production and Electricity as covered EITE sectors. There are several reasons to include them. First, each of them creates products that are exported from and imported to the United States and each of them are energy-intensive. Second, conditions have changed dramatically over the past decade, notably for oil and gas, with the United States now exporting significant and growing amounts of crude oil, finished petroleum products and LNG. Third, and most importantly, the Framework requires additional information on emissions of these and the other EITE sectors. To implement the Framework as applied to products, producers will need to know the cumulative GHG emissions (GGI) for inputs from their suppliers, and to determine and communicate them for products they sell.\nMost of the information required is currently available, though not all of it is published or communicated in suitable form. For example, neither federal regulation nor all states require that US electricity suppliers provide customers with information on GGI (in this case: COze per MWh)—although that information is submitted to and published by the US EPA.

Industrial facilities and power plants are required to report GHG emissions (and other information) to the US EPA. This information for facilities is available at EPA’s web sites for the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program” and for power plants at The Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID).*° However, sectors and regulators will need to consider what, if any, additional information and allocation methods would be needed to apply available information on GHG emissions for facilities to determine GGI for the products they produce, and how to provide that information to customers, primarily business-to-business customers, to implement the Framework.\nOne of the reasons for this study is to help to lay the groundwork to implement the Framework and to encourage US firms and trade associations in EITE sectors (as defined here in Section 3.5) to develop voluntary procedures to produce and share information on cumulative GHG emissions. Voluntary pilot efforts—perhaps public-private partnerships—in this area would help suppliers, producers, competitors, customers and regulators begin to understand the implications, challenges and benefits of developing such an upstream approach for border adjustments. Even in a preliminary, voluntary form, better information on GHG emissions required to produce products would increase transparency with regard to national GHG policy. In particular, it would provide the public, entrepreneurs and innovators with information that would inform their decisions and actions now. The information on\n24 https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do\n25 https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation- resource-integrated-database-egrid\nwww.rff.org | 14\ncumulative GHG emissions (GGI) will also inform citizens and consumers of the impact of the upstream tax paid only by a few businesses on the many downstream products purchased by consumers (e.g., gasoline }— though not everyone will regard this as a good idea.\n3.6. Border Adjustments in the Framework of a Cumulative Emissions Charge\nTable 1 (discussed above) explains the terms and definitions in the proposed Framework to account for upstream cumulative GHG emissions along the supply chain leading to products in EITE sectors, and how they can be used for rebates on exported products and to impose charges on imports.\nThe following example from petroleum fuel products makes clear that GGI can be materially greater than the carbon content of the fuels. Conventional petroleum fuels manufactured anywhere in the world have essentially identical carbon content. For example, a gallon of gasoline contains 2.42 kg carbon that would release 8.89 kg of CO2 upon combustion; while a gallon of jet fuel contains 2.61 kg carbon that would release 9.57 kg of CO2*° (these values are for petroleum fuels without added biofuel). GGI includes contributions from a refinery’s process emissions (if any) and from inputs to the refiner from other manufacturers, e.g. crude oil, electricity and commercial fuels. These can differ significantly depending on how crude oil was extracted, processed and transformed into a product slate. Life cycle analyses?’ show that, on average in the US, emissions (CO2ze) associated with production and refining of crude oil add another 20 percent (1/3 from production, 2/3 from\n26 For convenient list of fuels and emissions a see: www.rff.org/blog/2017/calculating-various-fuel-prices- under-carbon-tax\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al\nrefining) to those from combustion of petroleum fuels, while in Canada production and refining of oil sands on average adds 30 percent. So, on average, GGI for gasoline or other finished products would be at least 20 percent higher than a value based solely on its carbon content. Moreover, GGI varies considerably depending on the particular resource produced, emissions associated with purchased electricity, and the product slate of the refinery. For commodity products like gasoline sold by a distributor, where profit margins for end-use sales are only a few percent, the variation from different suppliers could be an important determinant of competitiveness. Similarly, GGI for electricity suppliers will vary significantly and have an impact on the amount of the GHG charge passed on to EITE producers depending on the source of fuel and technology used to produce electricity.\n4. Cross Cutting Issues: Electricity, Co- Generation and Recycling\nThis section describes, in general, how the Framework addresses three important cross- cutting issues that affect nearly every EITE sector: electricity, co-generation and recycling.\n4.1. Electricity\nBecause every EITE sector relies to some extent on electricity as an input, an upstream GHG tax will alter the competitiveness of domestic producers of electricity and sectors that use electricity. To date, discussions of border adjustments in the United States have always considered the need to address the implications of electricity, especially since lower-cost, GHG-intense electricity in many developing nations could create competitiveness issues. This is incorporated in\n27 See Canadian Oil Sands: Life-Cycle Assessments of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Richard K. Lattanzio, March 10, 2014, Congressional Research Service https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42537.pdf\nwww.rf.org | 15\nthe Framework by including electricity as an EITE sector. In practice, the key to implementation is to require that electricity suppliers provide the relevant information: GGI (COze per MWh) to their customers. Information on direct emissions from power plants (CO2 per MWh, not CO2ze) is already reported to the EPA by suppliers (as described above in Section 3.5); however, electricity suppliers are not currently required to communicate that information to their customers. For this Framework, as described in the previous section, electricity suppliers would need to know and report not only the carbon content of their fuels, but also the cumulative GHG emissions required to produce them. For this reason, we would require electricity suppliers (like all other EITE suppliers) to determine and communicate cumulative emissions GGI to customers, especially those in other EITE industries.\n4.2. Cogeneration\nCombined heat and power, presents an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity exists because operations in many EITE sectors require copious amounts of process heat to carry out transformations. Once generated to supply the heat necessary for its primary purpose, e.g., generation of steam for use in several processes throughout the facility, in many settings the residual, otherwise wasted heat can be used to co- produce electricity that can then be used in the facility or, when regulations allow it, sold for use by others outside the facility. Cogeneration dramatically improves the overall, combined energy efficiency to produce steam and electricity, compared with producing them separately. The challenge arises because of ambiguity about how to determine the emissions from co-generation facilities and, even more, how to allocate them among products, e.g., electricity and steam.\nWhen a facility such as a refinery implements cogeneration, it does so to take advantage of the residual heat available after producing steam to satisfy the enormous\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\ndemand in numerous units across the entire facility. In this case the cogeneration facility is not managed to optimize profit from its ability to produce two products: steam and electricity, but, rather, to serve the larger need to run the entire facility safely, efficiently and profitably. As well, the cogeneration unit may utilize fuels from internal operations or purchased fuels and electricity acquired to meet the needs of the entire facility. In this situation, it seems appropriate to consider treating the unit as an internal operation that affects overall operating costs and to regard any electricity sold outside the fence to have been generated with zero emissions. That is: none of the GHG emissions from the cogeneration unit, or the inputs from purchased fuels and electricity, should be allocated to the product: electricity sold by the refinery; all of them should be allocated to the slate of petroleum products produced by the entire refinery.\nThe situation would be entirely different for a stand-alone cogeneration facility run by an independent operator, perhaps to provide electricity and heat in some form to a variety of customers in an industrialized locale. In that case, the independent producer should be required to obtain GGI indices for purchased inputs and to specify the basis to allocate them to products it sells to others.\n4.3. Recycling\nMany EITE sectors, e.g., steel, aluminum, pulp and paper, make extensive use of recycled materials. Typically, these require far less energy to be transformed into new products than is required to convert fresh raw materials. However, the gathering process is such that recycled materials from many sources may be combined in such a way that it is impossible to determine their provenance. Consequently, there may be no reliable way to determine values GGI for them. Accordingly, in most cases we recommend that a single US national average should be assigned to recycled materials. However, in some situations other approaches may be\nwww.rff.org | 16\npreferable—details are discussed for several sectors in the Compendium.\n5. Application of the Framework to IIlustrative EITE Sectors\nThis section discusses procedures to determine GHG taxes, and cumulative GHG emissions, export rebates and import charges for products in EITE sectors: first in general and then in more detail for several illustrative sectors. As discussed above in Section 3.5, the information necessary to determine factors required to implement the Framework (primarily the carbon content of fossil resources and fuels, process emission from operations in EITE sectors and the cumulative emissions index: GGI) appears to be available, although not necessarily in convenient or appropriate form. As discussed above this is analogous to the approach used with VAT to track that tax. As an administrative procedure, the Framework determines cumulative GHG emissions using GGI for specific products from specific manufacturers and combines them to determine a national average <GGI > for the firm’s entire domestic production from all its facilities. If the product is exported, then <GGI> X (US GHG tax) is the rate (US$ per tonne) for the rebate. Similarly, for imported products of a specific foreign manufacturer, their domestic average <GGI> is the basis for the import charge rate: <GGI> X (US GHG tax); however, if firm-specific information is not available, then an average for the product based on the entire EITE sector will be used for the import charge.\nFor each sector, the Framework applies to specific manufacturing facilities and operations in the same way. A manufacturer transforms inputs, 1.e., products, from a variety of suppliers into new products that will be sold to customers. The approach requires the manufacturer to determine total cumulative GHG emissions: GHG Total (in tonnes COze), from all inputs and the emissions (tonnes COze) implied by GHG taxes paid (if any) to operate the facility, 1.e., Total Tax divided by GHG charge rate. (Keep\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nin mind that upstream producers of fossil resources “pre-pay” the GHG tax for emissions that will later occur from processing, e.g., by refiners, and combustion by end-users of fuels.) GHG Total is the amount of emissions to be allocated to the entire slate of products produced by the facility. For many sectors, it is appropriate to allocate GHG Total to products by simple procedures, such as by weight in proportion to the weight of all products, or, in the case of produced fossil resources and processed fossil fuels, in proportion to their carbon content. However, for other sectors this may require additional information and procedures.\nAs discussed in the Compendium, and illustrated in Figure 1 for a few sectors, all sectors include contributions to GGI from their use of purchased commercial fuels and electricity, and only a few sectors, notably producers of coal, oil and natural gas, and manufacturers who convert limestone to CO2 and lime, pay upstream GHG taxes. In the United States, the information necessary to determine upstream GHG taxes for facilities and operations and to determine rebates for exported products (GGI) appears to be available in most cases. However, it will need to be combined in new ways, especially to determine allocations for cumulative GHG emissions from suppliers and manufacturers to GGI for products in some sectors and to resolve associated issues, e.g., with cogeneration and recycling. Work will be required to determine GGI for imported products, especially those manufactured in nations without well-developed procedures for firms to measure and report GHG emissions from facilities and operations, or by firms without adequate capacity and experience.\nThe Compendium contains descriptions of the way the Framework could be implemented for Oil & Gas Production, Coal Production, Petroleum Refineries, and Electricity, and includes shorter modules for another 31 EITE sectors. In every case there are elements that must be managed by one or more administrative agencies that would need to be\nwww.rff.org | 17\nwww.rff.org | 18\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nwith both WTO and UNFCCC obligations. The Framework proposed here does that.\nThe Framework proposal describes procedures to implement WTO-compliant border adjustments in the context of an upstream US domestic GHG tax—an indirect domestic tax on products that can be rebated for exports and applied to imports. Border adjustments are based on objective, internationally recognized methodologies to measure GHG emissions from facilities and operations of manufacturers in EITE industries. However, to apply them to products traded in international commerce these methods require extensions as proposed here: 1) to include contributions to GHG emissions from upstream suppliers of products utilized by specific manufacturers, and 2) to allocate GHG emissions from facilities of a given manufacturer to the specific products that they produce. The Framework does this using an efficient administrative tool (analogous to VAT in other settings) to track cumulative GHG emissions from suppliers to manufacturers of domestic products eligible for export rebates and to products imported from foreign nations.\nIn general, the Framework estimates emissions associated with specific products without having to examine each step in the sequence to produce the product. The first few, very energy-intensive steps usually account for the vast majority of GHG emissions in the entire production chain required to manufacture EITE products. Once those are accounted for, emissions for final products can be allocated using simple rules, e.g., based on the carbon content of the processed fuel, or average emissions per unit weight of precursors incorporated in the final product, e.g., raw steel transformed to bars or pipes. This simplification serves the dual environmental and administrative goals of reducing GHG emissions to limit risks from climate change without undue administrative burden.\nThe Framework covers not only CO2 but also emissions of other significant GHGs covered by US regulations. This allows the\nspecified in legislation to implement the proposed Framework. In view of the significant sums involved and the close link to the upstream GHG tax, collection and disbursement of import charges and rebates should be assigned to the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service. Because of its extensive involvement with trade issues, tariffs, domestic and foreign companies and foreign governments, including via investigations carried out in foreign countries, the most logical US federal agency to administer these border adjustment methodologies is the Office of Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. Activities associated with border adjustments would include determining charges for imports and rebates for exports based on approved procedures and receiving information on covered products from affected firms and trade associations. This would also require annual updates of required information recognizing that important changes may occur as technologies and practices by manufacturers evolve, and that these will also affect their suppliers, e.g. of electricity and commercial fuels.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nFor decades, proponents and opponents of actions to address climate change have recognized that ambitious climate policies may shift production in EITE industries to nations with less stringent policies, resulting in leakage of GHG emissions and loss of business, jobs and investment. These concerns continue under the Paris Agreement (2015) because national pledges—most extending to 2030—differ significantly both in stringency and types of policies they use to limit GHG emissions. Proposed remedies typically rely on border adjustments with relief for exports and charges on imports. However, devising WTO-consistent border adjustments has proven to be challenging (see footnote 4). To avoid lengthy, potentially divisive battles between trading partners, it would be desirable to formulate domestic climate policies that are compatible\nGHG tax (in US$ per tonne CO2) to be applied to the full set of emissions expressed as tonnes CO? equivalent (CO2e). To track the flow of cumulative emissions from suppliers to producers in all EITE sectors the Framework includes Oil & Gas Production, Petroleum Refining, Coal Production and Electricity as well as the 46 sectors within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that were determined to be presumptively eligible under H.R. 2454 (2009). Most of the information required for the Framework is currently available and reported to the US EPA, though not all of it is published or communicated in suitable form. For example, neither federal regulation nor all states require that US electricity suppliers provide customers with information on the GHG emissions (CO2e per MWh) associated with their purchase of electricity.\nTo avoid “gaming” that might be done to cherry pick products from the most or least GHG intense manufacturers of firms in specific nations, and in recognition of the lack of clear provenance in many cases, we propose that products exported by US companies, or those imported from foreign firms, should be assigned emissions based on the average for the firm’s entire domestic production of that product, or, if specific firm averages are not available, then based on the average for the entire national sector. This also serves the purpose of assuring for WTO- compliance that rebates for exports do not exceed the domestic tax and that imports are not subject to internal taxes or charges in excess of those applied to like domestic products.\nTo apply equally to all nations this approach does not take account of GHG policies, regulations and costs already imposed in the exporting nation—which differ enormously among nations that trade with the US. While this runs counter to many discussions of border adjustments, it also has additional advantages besides being WTO- compliant. In particular, it is extremely difficult to assess the actual cost of the portfolio of GHG policies used in many\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\nnations, let alone their cost to specific products. For the United States and other nations that adopt it, in essence, this proposal fundamentally shifts costs to mitigate emissions connected to international trade from a system based on where goods are produced to one where they are consumed. A companion Compendium discusses how the Framework would be applied in many EITE sectors. In particular, it provides detailed discussions for producers of Coal, Oil & Gas, Electricity, and Petroleum Refining and modules of varying length for 31 other EITE sectors. While much of the required information on GHG emissions appears to be available, it is not in the appropriate form in many cases and will require effort to develop approved procedures to allocate emissions to products and product slates of manufacturers.\nOne of the reasons for this study is to help to lay the groundwork to implement the Framework and to encourage US firms and trade associations in EITE sectors to pro- actively develop voluntary procedures to produce and share information on cumulative GHG emissions. As with development of GHG emissions reporting that began in earnest in the 1990s, this effort will no doubt require several years to understand and find solutions for complications and challenges that will surely arise. International sectoral trade associations and multi-national companies can play an essential role building expertise and capacity in other nations and sharing their experience from efforts in many nations to develop internationally accepted procedures. Both will be invaluable to establish accepted procedures for internationally traded products. Voluntary pilot efforts—perhaps public-private partnerships—in this area would help suppliers, producers, competitors, customers and regulators begin to understand the implications, challenges and benefits of developing such an upstream approach for border adjustments. Such information would increase transparency with regard to national GHG policy. In particular, 1t would provide many actors with information that would\nwww.rff.org | 19\nResources for the Future | Flannery et al.\ninform their decisions and actions now. The information would also inform citizens and consumers of the impact of the upstream tax paid only by a few businesses on the many downstream products purchased by consumers (e.g., gasoline)—though not everyone will regard this as a good idea.\nFinally, the need to find WTO-compatible procedures for border adjustments is likely to grow as domestic and international climate policies evolve. The ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement will require rapid transformational change at a scale that is difficult to comprehend: one that will surely have growing implications and challenges for trade and investment. On the one hand, trade and international investment will need to work even more effectively than today to develop and deploy advanced technologies on a vast scale. On the other hand, they are likely to exacerbate tensions associated with GHG leakage and jobs, trade and investment. Developing policies and agreed procedures that are compatible with both WTO and UNFCCC obligations will be essential to smooth the transition.\nwww.rff.org | 20\nNot showing feedbacks\nfrom Other Sectors\nPetroleum\nLiquids\noo\nSo\nRefining\nTable 1.

        "pdf_text": "EU Green Deal — Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism EDF Contribution\nThe Climate Law, published by the Commission on 4 March 2020, includes the goal of climate neutrality for the EU by 2050 and suggests an increased climate ambition to reduce GHG emissions by 50-55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Reaching these targets is likely to involve a significant increase in EU ETS carbon price that can lead to carbon leakages. To allow competitive EU industries to decarbonize their processes, EDF supports the principle of a Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism to offer a level playing field between EU industrial products and imports from third countries under less stringent carbon pricing policies.\nThe power sector in Europe is already affected by carbon leakages as fossil fuel based electricity is imported to the EU ETS region mainly from Russian, Ukraine, the Western Balkans and Morocco. Unlike domestically produced electricity, this imported electricity is not subject to carbon pricing which leads to markets distortions and undermines the effectiveness of the EU ETS to decarbonize the power sector. Carbon leakage in the electricity sector should be combatted. A CBA mechanism could be easier to design for the power sector than for others because some methodologies already exist to estimate the carbon content of electricity.\nOther industrial sectors - including electro-intensive industries due to the indirect price of carbon- are likely to be at risk of carbon leakages given their high energy consumption and their exposure to international markets (eg. cement, steel, aluminum, chemicals). In theory a CBA mechanism would be an efficient tool to ensure that all products are subject to a carbon pricing similar to the one applied in the EU and help European industries to decarbonize. From a practical point of view, significant technical (calculation of carbon content of imported goods), legal (WTO compliance), strategic (possible retaliatory measures) and political challenges will necessarily arise during the design and implementation of such a mechanism, which will need to be addressed. An important part of the work will also relate to the selection of sectors subject to this measure. The Commission should conduct an in-depth study on possible impacts of a CBA mechanism on strategic low carbon value chains — mainly renewables and storage — for which imports currently play a role in the development of cost-competitive projects.\nDifferent options can be designed to implement a CBA mechanism, either through a tariff on importations or through the participation to a carbon trading scheme. One possible option is therefore the participation of importers of products from third countries in the EU-ETS to replicate the same conditions as for domestic producers who pay a carbon price. If importers are made subject to the EU-ETS and entitled to purchase allowances, the demand is expected to increase, which could have a significant impact on the EU-ETS market balance and drive prices up. Another option could be a tariff on importations, the level of which varies automatically with the traded EU ETS price to ensure a level playing field. In any case, the EU- ETS must always provide a significant and predictable CO2 price signal that puts the EU on a cost-effective decarbonisation pathway.\nFinally, it should be stressed that CBA mechanisms are not the silver bullet for achieving an ambitious climate goal in the European industry. Other policy tools to mitigate carbon leakages risks and encourage low carbon investments in energy-intensive industrial sectors will be needed for preparing the future. A CBA mechanism should be part of a wider package of complementary policies to achieve carbon neutrality in a cost-efficient and socially acceptable way. Bilateral agreements on climate ambition/policy could be a complementary way to engage other countries in implementing policies to reduce their GHG emissions. As massive investments will be needed in industry to undertake appropriate restructuring of value chains and decarbonize their processes, the EU should also focus on implementing measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in Europe. Support for research and innovation and a climate-driven industrial policy will therefore be crucial in establishing a true EU leadership."

The single most important issue the Commission should first determine is the exact purpose of the measure. Only once the exact purpose of the measure is ascertained, only then can the detailed structure of the measure be determined, because the former informs the later. Official EU documents and speeches of EU officials suggest a mix of two purposes. On the one hand, suggestion is made that the purpose of the measure is to avoid carbon leakage. On the other, suggestion is made that the purpose is to encourage 3™ countries to increase their climate ambitions. However, both purposes require different measures. The primary tool to avoid carbon leakage have historically been free allowances, therefore the solution to avoid further carbon leakage in context of EU’s increased climate ambitions would need to be based on the free allowances concept. If, on the other hand, the purpose of the measure is to encourage 3 countries to increase their own climate ambitions by using access to the EU market as an incentive, then the mechanism should be a border measure imposing cost on polluting imports. This instrument, however, is not concerned with carbon leakage and therefore does not revolve around the free allowance concept and should be kept separate therefrom.\nCarbon Leakage. If the Commission determines that avoiding carbon leakage is central to the new mechanism, a thorough analysis of carbon leakage that has already occurred since ETS was introduced should be carried out in order to identify the sectors most exposed (and therefore eligible for CBAM) and verify whether existing measures for preventing carbon leakage have been successful.\nIn this context, it is important to note that EU law does not provide a clear definition of what exactly constitutes carbon leakage. Different interpretations of this term lead different stakeholders and institutions to reach different results on whether carbon leakage actually occurs.\nGrupa Azoty therefore ask the Commission to be flexible and inclusive. Specifically, any processes - such as changes in trade or investment patterns - that result in the manufacturing of products consumed in the European Union, or previously produced in the European Union (even if destined for exports) where they had been subject to ETS, to\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nincreasingly take place outside the European Union, where they are not subject to carbon pricing, should be considered carbon leakage. In this sense, replacement of EU production by foreign production should always be considered as carbon leakage, as production is moving away from ETS-imposed carbon pricing. The exact reason for such shifts in trade or investment patterns is not as determinative as its result of avoiding cost of carbon emissions. The physical transfer of EU production facilities to 3\" countries should not be required to determine existence of carbon leakage.' In fact - such transfer will occur only in the most extreme of cases. Most carbon leakage occurs through EU producers losing domestic and exports markets to non-EU/ETS production, as well as investments into new capacities. This loss does not even have to occur within one company: if EU company decreases production, but another foreign company increases production, builds a new foreign production facility to supply the EU market, redirects its existing production to the EU market to replace the production lost by the EU company, or redirects it existing production to a 3 market replacing prior EU exports to that market, that too is carbon leakage as EU production that was subject to carbon pricing is replaced by 3 country production that is not subject to carbon pricing.\nTherefore, while assessing carbon leakage, the Commission should take into account four easily ascertainable data points for the sector and its key products: (1) the volume of production, (2) the volume of imports into the EU;” (3) the volume of exports out of the EU; and (4) list of investments in new production capacities in the sector in both the EU and abroad, in particular in key countries exporting to the EU, especially if they are in close proximity to the EU. This data for the last fifteen years would allow the EC to establish carbon leakage in this sector. For example, if imports into the EU are growing while exports are decreasing, both for the sector as a whole and its main products, and investments in new capacities are taking place outside of the EU at disproportionate rate compared to those in the EU, then carbon leakage is occurring. If the opposite dynamic takes place, then no carbon leakage occurs.\nIn addition, other points need to be clarified. The Inception Impact Assessment states - following the Green Deal Communication - that “[a]s long as many international partners do not share the same climate ambition as the EU, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs when production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction or when EU products are replaced by more carbon- intensive imports.” (emphasis added).\nFirst, it should be determined whether in fact risk of carbon leakage occurs only if “many” international partners do not share the same climate goals as the EU. It may be that even\n1 In this the Commission to precise terminology when referring to carbon sense, we encourage use leakage and avoid phrases suggesting such transfer is required (such as “Carbon leakage occurs when production is transferred from the EU to other countries.”)\n2 In analyzing trade flows, EU should exclude impact that EU trade defence could have volume of any on imports into the EU.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\na very limited number of partners not sharing EU climate goals and therefore not limiting carbon emissions in their territory could lead to significant carbon leakage, if they are in close proximity to the EU. A single or just a few countries with no carbon emission limits could easily become export hubs of carbon-intensive products to the EU market, if the risk is not addressed.\nSecond, some EU documents state that carbon leakage occurs when EU production is replaced by “more carbon intensive imports. ” However, unless exporting country has an an ETS system that is linked to ETS, it is impossible to verify whether imports from non-EU countries are more or less carbon-intensive than EU production. Also, even if imports are just as emission-intensive as EU production, but more competitive due to lack of ETS costs in home countries, the replacement of EU production by such imports also may constitute carbon leakage. The Commission should therefore investigate how carbon leakage is described in its documents related to the new mechanism to ensure consistent messaging.\nFree Allowances. As Grupa Azoty believes that the purpose of CBAM should be exclusively encouraging 3\" countries and 3 country exporters to lower their carbon emissions, CBAM should not affect in any way the current carbon leakage measures, in particular free allowances. Grupa Azoty considers that free allowances do not conflict with CBAM, as any benefits that EU producers get from free allowances can be considered in the value of CBAM measure imposed on imports at the border, considering the emission-intensity of the imported product. For example, the net cost that an EU producer and a 3 country producer with identical production emissions should pay could be analogous. This needs to be emphasized and is key to securing the political support for CBAM: the purpose of CBAM is not to lead to double protection. Its only purpose should be to incentivize 3 countries and exporters to lower their emissions, by imposing a cost at EU border. This is not linked in any way to free allowances. The Impact Assessment should consider how to make this possible in a non-discriminatory way.\nProduction vs. Consumption Emissions. The Commission should study how the fact that most EU countries contribute to greenhouse emissions more by consumption than production,? affects WTO compatibility of any border measures. It seems that since imports, not production, are major contributors to carbon emissions in the EU then a measure targeting imports should be consistent with environmental objectives of lowering carbon emissions.\nSectors. Another key question is what sectors should be covered by the mechanism. The Commission should use a number of objective criteria to select the sectors, to ensure the process is objective, fact-based and not political. Some of the criteria the Commission could use include:\n(1) anticipated/estimated carbon emissions of imports of this sector;\n3\nl.e. consumption emissions for most EU countries higher than production emissions.\nare\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\n(2) attractiveness of the EU market for imports of this sector; (3) historical volume of imports of this sector (import intensity); (4) whether the sector already pays for emission allowances under ETS or whether it has surplus allowances from previous years (i.e., whether the sector actually incurs a cost that is not compensated by current or past free allowances); (5) number of exporting countries and individual exporters supplying the EU market in this sector;* (6) impact on downstream industries (here, one of the key criteria is whether the product is mainly a finished good, or mainly an intermediate product);° (7) type of emissions (direct or indirect),° and (8) production complexity of the sector in terms of calculating emissions.\nThe relative weight and importance of these criteria should be matched to the purpose of the measure: different criteria should be prioritized if the purpose of CBAM is prevention of carbon leakage, and different if the purpose is encouraging 3™ countries to increase their climate ambitions.\nType of the Measure. The Commission should evaluate what type of measure would best accomplish the objective and what features such measure should have. If - regardless of its ultimate objective - the measure is expected to be responsive to the emission-intensity of the imported product, then the measures would have to be devised in a way that allows the authority to establish the emissions related to the specific imported product and impose an adequate duty, cost or levy.\nThe best unilateral measure that the EU can introduce to incentivize 3 countries to reduce their carbon emissions may be an import greenhouse gas emission tariff, the purpose of which is to introduce on imports ETS costs identical to producing in the European Union, inclusive of transport emissions of bringing the product to the EU border.’ The border is the place where emission-intensity of the imported product could most easily be evaluated. The Commission should therefore also study whether it is practically\n4 The smaller the number of exporting countries and exporting companies, the manageable the more system would be in practice when assessing the level of the measure.\n5 Finished goods should be preferred, intermediate products could raise problems with decreasing as competitiveness of the finished goods industry.\n6\nThe mechanism should focus mainly direct emissions, indirect emission too difficult to\non as are properly quantify in a 3 country, EU industry’s emissions depend on their national energy mix (no reliable EU average), and some EU Member States may compensate them nationally in certain sectors, therefore it would be practically difficult to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of imports.\n7\nInclusion of emission from\nis\nthe\nis eliminate emissions.\ntransportation necessary, as objective to Bringing the product to Europe leads to increased emissions, therefore should be included. However, transport emissions within the EU do not have to be included, until EU industry does not incur similar cost.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nfeasible for other forms of the measure, such as an internal consumption tax, to differentiate the value of the levy depending on the products’ emission-intensity.\nVariability of the Measure. The measure’s main feature should be to impose cost on imports that compensates for direct carbon emissions during production of the product and bringing the product to the European Union. This implies that the same type of products could be subject to different level of tariff/tax/duty, depending on their exact production processes, installations, or transportation methods. Only this way a differentiation between “green” products and “polluting” products could be made. Accordingly, the mechanism should allow (1) assessment or verification of the emission intensity of the imported product, and (2) imposition of variable tariff, whose value depends on emission intensity of the product. The Impact Assessment should analyze how to structure a variable duty system that is practicable for the authorities, yet punishes polluting products and rewards the “green” products.\nTwo-Level System. To impose a carbon measure at the border in a non-discriminatory, WTO-complaint manner, that is at the same time practically manageable, the system could be based on a two-level approach.\nFirst level. An estimation of emission-intensity of the product should be carried out, based on publicly available information,® considering the exporting country or region. This evaluation should result in setting up an automatic default value to be used for majority of imports, depending on their origin. A default automatic system is necessary, as the system cannot function with detailed analysis of emission-intensity of every single import. This default value would be added to the EU customs system to be imposed on imports of specific products falling into covered customs codes, assigned to specific exporting countries (countries of origin), together with the regular import tariff. It would function as an “all others rate” in trade defence proceedings.\nSecond level. A system should also be introduced allowing individual exporters claiming lower emission intensity than the default one to prove that they qualify for preferential lower rate or no rate at all. Accordingly, a verification system could be created to allow verification of exporters’ claims of lower emission intensity. This system could be modeled on trade defense proceedings, including exporters’ questionnaires that are later verified on spot by EC staff or a private 3 party certification system.\nThe Impact Assessment should analyze how best to establish the system so a fair duty can be imposed if no additional information on the imported product’s emissions is available, but at the same time how to enable importers to benefit if their imports are verifiably “green”.\n8 This information could be secured from publications, available commissioned studies provided by or interested parties, technical brochures, or even materials collected as part of a public consultation or data gathering process preceding the introduction of the measure, enabling all exporters, their public authorities and other interested parties to contribute.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nSubject Countries. In the Impact Assessment, the Commission should analyze whether all imports of the selected sectors are to be covered by the measure, or only imports from certain polluting countries. If some countries are exempt, the criteria for such an exemption must be determined.\nGrupa Azoty believes it is paramount that the Commission does not exempt any countries a priori, as this (1) could raise WTO discrimination issues (no MFN treatment), (2) would lead to politization of the system (powerful countries could force the EC to exempt them), and (3) would weaken the carbon-reducing incentives of an across-the-board applicable system (formal compliance with environmental criteria would prevail over factual compliance or real cost imposed). Instead, any preferences given to countries lowering emissions should be dealt with within the value of the first level duty described above. For example, a country operating a domestic carbon-pricing system or formally complying with the Paris Agreement could be offered a lower default rate. Or - preferably - a case-by-case analysis should be done for each exporter claiming to be subject to a domestic carbon-pricing system. On spot verifications - similar to those conducted in trade defense cases - could verify that carbon emissions had in fact been paid for in the accounting documents of the producing exporter. The Impact Assessment should analyze which model of considering the exporting countries’ different levels of climate ambitions could be most effective.\nCarbon vs. Greenhouse Emissions. Grupa Azoty also believes that to achieve EU climate objectives, CBAM should not only cover carbon emissions (i.e., carbon dioxide), but all greenhouse gas emissions that are subject to the ETS for the given sector. In the case of fertilizers, this also includes N20.\nTransportation Emissions. If the objective of CBAM is to eliminate or lower emissions generated by EU consumption through pressuring exporters and exporting countries to lower emissions involved in bringing the product to the European Union, then the Commission should consider including in the CBAM not only the emissions generated in the production process of the imported product, but also the transportation emissions generated in bringing the product to the EU border. While EU producers do not pay similar emission cost, they do not have these emissions at all, so WTO non-discrimination principle would be kept. The Impact Assessment should analyze how to quantify such emissions and whether they can be included in a WTO-compatible way.\nForm of Payment. The final issue the Commission should consider is the form of payment of the measure. As the reference for the payment would be emissions per ton of imported product, a price needs to be allocated to each ton of these emissions and method of payment established. As for the method payment, a decision must be made whether it should be cash, an ETS allowance or some quasi-ETS allowances. Requiring ETS allowances from importers could equalize their situation to EU producers, but on the other hand would most likely require increasing the number of allowances available. A cash payment would require establishing a carbon price that is identical to prices paid by EU producers with analogous ability to plan head or hedge for risk, which may be difficult to do. The\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com\nP.\nGruPa\nAaZOTY\nCommission should therefore investigate whether creation of a system analogous to ETS allowances, but parallel to it could be a possible solution.\nGrupa Azoty thanks the European Commission for the possibility to contribute in this consultation and looks forward to working with the Commission on developing the CBAM concept.\nGrupa Azoty S.A.\nwww.grupaazoty.com"

Climate change is a global challenge that must be handled in an international context, and we welcome an EU wide and international collaboration. We also believe that European companies are well positioned to be front runners in the green transition. \n\nWhile understanding the motive behind carbon border adjustment measures and agreeing with the objective to minimize carbon leakage, all kinds of border measures can result in unintended consequences.  \n\nCarbon border measures introduced only on raw materials such as steel and aluminum would neither target nor affect other materials and goods produced outside the EU. This could result in making such materials and goods produced in Europe more expensive, and less favorable compared to imported goods.  \n\nTo create an unequal playing field for European industries and producers of materials and goods could result in increased risk of carbon leakage, and put European competitiveness and jobs at risk. \n\nConsequently, a thorough analysis of the implications of carbon border adjustment measures are needed to understand the impact on the European industry, to be able to introduce effective carbon reduction measures while respecting international trade obligations and promoting competitiveness of European corporations. \n\nIn order to avoid that clean European production is moved to other parts of the world with less favorable energy mix and less strict environmental legislation. \nEU produced materials and goods may become less competitive both locally and internationally, while products from outside the EU would become more profitable, this could, in turn, add to the reasons to place manufacturing outside the EU.

It is important that price increases on raw materials do not negatively impact firms further down the value chain. This could lead to carbon leakage in other sectors of the economy.

        "feedback": "Minerals, metals and advanced materials have a central role in the green transition, e.g. in the clean energy and transport sector. Ensuring a sustainable supply of raw materials is crucial for Europe's industrial leadership and to achieve a climate neutral, resource efficient and competitive European economy. Large investments are needed in industrial transformation, and it is of major importance for economic, employment as well as environmental and climate reasons that European industry remains competitive in the green transition. The fact that a limitation and/or a price on CO2 is missing in important competitor countries outside the EU already has consequences for the Swedish mining, mineral and metal industries today in favor of more carbon intensive production outside the EU, which does not benefit the climate nor the European economy. \nAgainst this background, Svemin welcomes the fact that a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is further considered at EU level. However, the devil is in the details, and in this context Svemin would like to highlight certain key aspects that need to be addressed in the design of a CBAM:\n \tClimate transition and competitiveness must go hand in hand. It is crucial that in the transition to become climate neutral, the industry can maintain and even improve competitiveness. A CBAM must be designed with the overall objective to contribute efficiently to reducing CO2 emissions in a way that is administratively manageable for companies and causes as little trade friction as possible.\n \tIt is crucial that the risk of carbon leakage for companies with export to third countries is addressed. The carbon and investment leakage that we already see today, i.e. that investments are prioritized in other countries with lower climate ambitions and higher CO2 emissions in production, must be addressed. This leakage is likely to increase over time if the EU increases its climate ambitions while other countries do not. Therefore, if the instrument of free allowances in the EU ETS is not compatible with a CBAM, another instrument that tackles the risk of carbon leakage must be developed.\n \tThe indirect costs for industry of a higher electricity price need to be taken into account. The mining and minerals industry in Sweden has adopted a roadmap in order to reach fossil-free mining operations by 2035 and climate neutral metals and mineral processing by 2045. In order to reach these climate targets, electrification is key. This requires access to fossil-free electricity at competitive prices. Svemin’s member companies are mainly established in the Nordic countries, with a very high degree of fossil free electricity. Due to the marginal cost pricing of electricity, the industry still pays the price of the coal, natural gas and oil in the system, even if the electricity is fossil free. The consequence is that switching from fossil fuels to fossil free electricity does not give any price incentives and competitive advantages for the first movers, but rather increased costs due to the increased electricity consumption that follows from moving away from fossil fuels and thus a competitive disadvantage compared to the slow movers. To get the incentives right to benefit the first movers, not punishing them, is crucial for the green transition and to achieve the EU climate targets. \n \tIt is crucial that the existing system remain functional until another solution has been tested and proved effective. A temporary weakening of competitiveness can lead to non-reversible effects that have a negative impact on the economy, the environment and the climate.\n \tParticular attention must be taken to ensure that no distorting effects are created between sectors and value chains in cases where different protection mechanisms would be applied to different sectors, e.g. free allocation of allowances for one sector and a CBAM for another. Ensuring a level playing field is essential for the functioning of the internal market.",

        "feedback": "Amongst the 3 main paths which are usually envisaged (ETS-based, trade measures, tax measures), only the former would allow to reach a sizable result in a relatively short timeframe. Indeed, relying on trade policy (strong application of modernised TDIs, upscaling of tariffs in order to internalise carbon costs, adequacy mechanisms in FTAs...) would either be underwhelming or on the contrary trigger harsh reactions/retaliation; in any case any meaningful move would need bilateral/multilateral negotiations (by definition, painstakingly long). The fiscal pathway is politically/institutionally difficult due to unanimity rule but not totally blocked thanks to the passerelle clause established in the environment title of TFEU; however even in the hypothetical case of a Council green light, it would mean almost starting from scratch to define the tool, so the CBAM would come very late. Yet climate action is needed asap.\nWhich brings us to the ETS approach, ie inclusion of imports: ETS covers « only » a subset of industry, yet those sectors (steel, cement, chemicals, paper, glass...) are responsible for a large proportion of industrial emissions (EU and worldwide). Thanks to the benchmark system already in place, and given the fact that we're only dealing with \"simple\" products and semi-products, calculation of typical carbon footprint is not so complex. With regards to the WTO, a measure that applies to both imports and domestic products should be fully accepted as long as it does not discriminate against imports (« national treatment ») or against imports from particular countries (MFN). From that perspective it appears that moving to a CBAM would necessarily mean getting rid of the much-abused system of free allocation of allowances (currently in place to prevent carbon leakage risk), otherwise it would be a clear discrimination in favour of domestic production. And it would probably make it difficult to pick-and-chose impacted products according to their origin. In any case, and even though it should be possible to devise a prima facie WTO-compatible mechanism, there's always the second layer of argumentation under Article XX (general exceptions)...\nA word of concern however with regards to the ETS as a whole (which explains why certain climate-minded stakeholders are reluctant to create a CBAM relying on it) : first it was demonstrated that the current parameters for Phase IV (especially LRF) are not in line with net-zero in 2050, and currently the Covid-19 crisis (and its consequences on industrial activities) shows that its market-based philosophy can run counter to its long-term goal goal (need of predictably rising CO2 price to change behaviours, but decrease of emissions = less demand of allowances = CO2 price going down). In order to end up with a credible, climatically ambitious and at the same time industrially fair system, an ETS-based CBAM cannot take place without an urgent fix of the ETS itself.\n",

The target of the Green Deal is to be the first carbon neutral continent by 2050 and to increase the ambition of CO2 reduction to 50...55% by 2030. The ambition level of other countries can be assessed after 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement have submitted their final Nationally Determined Contributions.\nGlobal CO2 emissions continue to grow. In addition to economic growth in emerging markets, this growth is driven by carbon leakage as it is more cost efficient to produce goods in emerging markets with lower environmental costs compared to production in EU. This is evident in the steel market where imports of stainless steel now account for more than 30% of the European steel consumption. At the same time, the steel produced in Asia creates up-to 5 times higher CO2 emissions compared to European producers’ emissions. Avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe.\nCarbon Border Adjustment is essential for the European carbon-neutrality\nTackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant due to the market characteristics of the sector. The 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” and the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive recognize the steel sector as the most exposed sector, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment. Also, the European Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialize in different forms, either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports”.\nAs long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts and the level of ambition between the EU and other countries differs, there is a need to reduce the risk for carbon leakage with effective measures in the short and medium term. This risk has been addressed by granting free allocation and indirect compensation in the EU ETS.\nEU ETS free allocation and indirect compensation are designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, thus tackling the carbon leakage only partly. Carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in the imported products if it takes into account the total carbon footprint. This would incentivize all companies globally to reduce their carbon footprint to remain competitive.

At the same time, the situation is counterproductive for the successful implementation of the European Green Deal\nTwo examples on how the level of CBA should be defined\n1 Taking into account the comprehensive product footprint including direct emissions, indirect emissions and the production of raw material (scopes 1, 2 and 3).

To an importing producer to gain a lower CBA, they would need to provide evidence that they have a smaller carbon footprint than the worst available technology in their home market\nCarbon footprint of Outokumpu and\nChinese stainless producers\nmScope 1 (direct)\nm Scope 2 (indirect)\nmScope 3 (raw materials)\nP|\nSC\nOutokumpu\nThe chart above illustrates the need to include scope 3 into carbon footprint calculation of stainless steel products as a significant part of the product CO2 footprint is typically attributed to scope 3. Including scope 3 could also tackle the risk of source shifting. If it is not possible to take the whole carbon footprint into account the EU needs to set limit values for product carbon footprint. The time-schedule and scoping should be the same as for carbon border adjustment\nReporting and measurement of carbon emissions as part of CBA\nThe reliability of the carbon emission data will be the biggest challenge for CBA. The data submitted by producers should be measured and reported according to a specified protocol and there should be a verification by a third party. The EU should define a standard for the calculation of the total carbon footprint. It would also be possible to use international standards, for example for life cycle assessment and protocols, in the submission of data and in setting limit values\nIn case the provided data would not be enough, there is scientific literature available that the EU could use There are also initiatives done by the EU Commission to study and pilot footprints. For example, the EU has piloted Product Environmental Footprints (PEF) and Organization Environmental Footprints (OEF). A PEF study measures all quantifiable environmental impacts over the life cycle of your product, including emissions to water, air and soil, resource use and depletion, and impacts from land and water use. For the purpose of CBA, only CO2 related data would be used\nChina\nSource: Outokumpu 2020\noutokumpu.com\noutokumpou\nhigh performance stainless steel\nThe current carbon leakage measures are still needed\nUntil the EU has a comprehensive CBA mechanism and enough experience of its functionality, the current tools to reduce the risk for carbon leakage, i.e. free allocation, and indirect compensation, are essential. Even if it is important to develop a border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. Even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future\nA carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. A border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would also decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain\nA carbon border measure should be applied for a transition period, until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and products with low carbon footprint reach a critical mass in the market. At the same time, it is an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that more ambitious reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully used for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies\nEU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the “trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies\nThere is also a need for a long-term regulatory framework for the advanced transition phase and the post- transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire lifecycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at the EU level and at the border\nOutokumpu Oyj, EU Transparency Register ID: 085686030231-69 Salmisaarenranta 11, 00180, Helsinki, Finland\nMore information: Mia Nores, Head of Low Carbon and Energy Efficiency mia.nores@outokumpu.com, +358 44 330 0928\n7 ™\n..\noutokumpu.com"

This would replace the current system whereby free EU emissions trading system (ETS) allowances are granted to certain industrial sectors based on emission benchmarks and, in some member states, state aid is offered to electro-intensive sectors that pay a heavy burden in the form of the higher electricity prices that result from the EU emissions trading system (ETS). Any mechanism must be compliant with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\nWTO compatibility\nWTO case law has not provided rulings on climate taxes. Article XX(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows measures that are “necessary” to protect human, animal or plant life or health. However, would a CBA applied at the EU level make a material contribution towards the global climate objective? Also, are there better policy options that would be less disruptive to trade?\nGATT Article XX(g) allows trade measures that are “related to” the conservation of exhaustible natural resources in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption. It is argued that clean air could be such a natural resource that can be depleted by pollutants, including greenhouse gases (GHGs).\nHere, it should also be noted that Article 3 of the the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) states that climate protection measures should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, or a disguised restriction to international trade.\nA domestic EU tax on carbon-intensive products (e.g. on steel, cement and aluminium), applied equally to imports, is one way forward and is WTO compatible. However, taxation in the EU is a national competence and an EU carbon tax would require unanimity across member states. It is for this reason that the EU adopted the EU ETS and also explains why the Commission is now exploring a CBA mechanism, rather than the carbon border tax that President von der Leyen sought in her mission letters to European Commissioners dated 10 September 2019.\nEURACOAL response\nEURACOAL understands that calls fora CBA mechanism are a logical counterbalance to the EU’s stringent, unilateral policies linked to climate action. We believe that European industrial competitiveness has been severely compromised, although we note that reports for the Commission suggest that this is not the case (e.g. reports of the Carbon Leakage Evidence Project). In 2017, the Commission concluded that, “While at present, ETS costs constitute a very small share of the total costs for industrial sectors covered by the ETS, even for energy intensive industries, the situation\nRue de la Science 14b 1040 Brussels Belgium\nn° d’entreprise 0408.290.816 EU transparency register no. 19853116579-64 +32 2 775 31 70 euracoal@euracoal.eu www.euracoal.eu\nEURACOAL\nmight change in the future ol . The situation has changed and it is for that reason that we support measures to “level the playing field” for EU industry. In fact, such measures are now essential and should apply to all sectors, including the power sector. However, whilst we can see the pros and cons of a CBA mechanism, we remain neutral on whether or not to introduce such a mechanism as there may be better alternatives.\nThe Commission states that, “the main objective of the carbon border adjustment is fighting climate change by avoiding carbon leakage.” EURACOAL believes that another objective of any measure introduced should be to preserve jobs and economic activity in Europe by enabling EU industry to compete on a level playing field.\nCurrently, EURACOAL has not reached a position on a CBA mechanism. We await concrete proposals, but offer some initial views here in our response paper.\n1. A global carbon emissions trading system — the ideal solution\nBefore considering other options, we suggest that the European Commission’s highest priority should be a diplomatic effort to engage with the world’s top carbon emitters — say the G20 countries — to agree an international carbon trading system.

For example, steel, aluminium, cement (concrete), timber and plastics are often interchangeable in construction and product design.

It would be a market distortion if EU officials had the power to assess the carbon penalties applied to particular materials for two reasons. Firstly, such assessments could never be “correct” as there is no perfect way to calculate embedded carbon emissions. Secondly, the Commission proposes to apply a CBA only to “selected sectors” which would effectively determine the market competitiveness of selected materials. This is unfair and would discourage the competitive forces that lead to better and more innovative products; CBAs for selected sectors would pre-empt decisions on material choice and might therefore unnecessarily increase carbon emissions when, for example, lightweight steel components produced in the EU are replaced by imported plastic ones.

The Commission would therefore have to fall back on assumed values for the carbon emissions associated with particular processes. Once again, the transparency and fairness of a CBA mechanism would be compromised if arbitrary decisions were taken based on embedded-carbon assumptions. Instead of a level playing field, it would penalise some at the expense of others and have unverifiable and uncertain environmental outcomes. These complexities point to the need for a simpler, more transparent, fairer approach that can be applied more easily to all sectors.\n4. Carbon trade wars\nAny imposition by the EU of a CBA mechanism, or any other form of carbon border taxation, would inevitably lead to a trade war with third countries. We saw this when the USA imposed tariffs on steel, kicking off a trade war which continues today. Other countries would view a CBA as protectionism. It is for the EU to decide if it wants to take this approach to trade, but EURACOAL itself has always championed open and transparent markets with fair competition on a level playing field, the international coal trade market being an excellent example.

This can be done by taking the value of any particular trade and imposing a tax based on the overall CO or GHG emissions per unit of GDP of the trading partner.’ No new administration is needed as the carbon tariffs could be added to existing tariffs collected through existing customs arrangements. Country-by-country GHG emission data is available from the UNFCCC, albeit with a three-year delay, and GDP data is available from the World Bank. The rate of carbon tariff, in terms of euros per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCOze), would have to be set unilaterally by the EU or by multi-lateral agreement.\nSuch an approach may also lead to trade wars, but the retaliatory measures would hopefully be limited to third countries imposing import tariffs on goods from the EU at the same rate, based on the EU’s carbon emissions per unit of GDP. In practice, such tariffs would disadvantage poorer nations vis-d-vis wealthier ones who can afford cleaner, more expensive energy sources. As such, it could reduce trade and lead to impoverishment or even resentment.\nThere are no easy answers to encourage the rest of the world to follow the EU and adopt equally tough climate policies. EURACOAL looks forward to a wider debate on this important topic and will reach a position on a CBA mechansim after a proper internal debate of a concrete proposal from the Commission.\n1 April 2020\n> e) / (€/tCO.e) Tariff (€) = value of goods (€) x national GHG emissions (tCO GDP (€) x carbon tariff\n3"

In this perspective, measures aimed at safeguarding the competitiveness of European industries are imperative, especially if directed to offset the effects of an increased cost of production linked to choices aimed at fostering the energy transition towards a low carbon economy.\n\n•\tA mechanism to reduce the risk of carbon leakage as well as EU industries being less competitive due to higher energy costs is therefore deemed as an appropriate measure bringing together also valuable economic and social impacts. Indeed, production activities set up (or relocated) outside Europe only for exploiting lower energy costs for the absence of negative externalities correction mechanisms (e.g. Emission Trading System or other arrangements in the EU framework, such as Energy Taxation Directive) determine a net adverse environmental balance at global level.\n\n•\tEuropean industry is characterised by a top-class energy system for reasons linked to both technological and legislative evolutions. Such a competitive advantage should not be undermined by the introduction of the virtuous legislative provisions envisaged under the new EU Green Deal aimed at safeguarding the environment. In this perspective, a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” could defend EU economy on the one side against delocalisation choices and on the other side from competition against goods produced at lower costs by using more polluting fuels. This would have a double negative effect: on society, for the loss of local employments and skills, and on environment, since the overall pollutants level is not reduced, being GHG emitted elsewhere in the atmosphere.\n\n•\tAdditionally, we share the view that a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” would contribute to the enhancement of the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) diffusion both in and outside Europe. In particular, a well-designed and properly implemented adjustment scheme could prevent obstacles in the development of renewable gases technologies and the whole supply chain needed to support the energy transition (biomethane and hydrogen newly-born European sectors), that could be endangered by distortive/unfavourable competitive conditions.\n\n•\tThe “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” should be also designed to consider the effects of the policy decisions on export goods in order to keep the competitiveness of EU industries at global level. In this respect, if an increase in costs for imported goods produced with more polluting fuels will be put in place,  equally also a “discount” for exported goods have to be envisaged if those products are produced with low carbon and/or renewable sources (such as biomethane, syngas, hydrogen and abated natural gas).\n\n•\tWhen designing the legislative measures establishing the Mechanism, a correct link with EU Emission Trading System and Energy Taxation Directive should be ensured to adequately reflect in the imported products prices the cost of carbon as well as the different taxation levels applied to energy sources according to their environmental and social impacts.\n \n•\tA “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” would allow to gradually overcome the free allowances granting system - introduced also for mitigating the carbon leakage risk – so that the cost of carbon would be correctly reflected in all the economy sectors.\n",

EEX develops, operates and connects secure, liquid and transparent markets for energy and commodity products. At EEX, contracts on power, emission allowances as well as freight and agricultural products are traded or registered for clearing. EEX is part of Group Deutsche Borse.\nEEX is involved in the EU ETS through its appointment as the Common Auction Platform for 25 EU Member States, as well as, the Opt-out Platform for Germany and conducting auctions for Poland, and as a secondary trading platform for emission allowances. Beyond Europe, EEX is actively supporting emissions market developments in China in collaboration with local partners. In North America, EEX Group’s Nodal Exchange, in cooperation with IncubEx, develops and offers a wide range of environmental products for the North American market including trading in California and RGGI carbon allowances. From this perspective, EEX takes a global perspective on carbon pricing. EEX is a strong advocate and active supporter of increased cooperation and mutual learning between different emissions trading systems as a key policy tool to achieve global emissions reduction targets.\nEEX strongly supports the European Green Deal\nEEX welcomes the Green Deal initiative as a pivotal step for Europe to achieve its ambitious 2030 and 2050 climate targets and assert its role as global climate action leader. Energy markets, and in particular power and emissions markets, will be a key instrument in delivering on Europe’s long-term climate ambitions.\nEuropean energy and emissions markets cannot be considered in isolation, especially when it comes to decarbonisation. Europe is one of the world’s largest energy net importers as well as an important centre of industrial production and final consumption. Europe’s action will have a significant influence on decarbonisation at the global stage.\nThe global expansion of carbon pricing offers significant potential for cooperation\nEEX agrees on the need to address possible carbon leakage from the European Union, as well as supporting European business competing in the global market by creating a level playing field across different national jurisdictions. At the same time, both the existing carbon leakage provisions as well as any new mechanism should take into account global climate policy developments. Over the last few years, we have seen a rapid increase in carbon pricing globally, in particular in form of emissions trading schemes. There are now 21 systems covering 29 jurisdictions with an ETS in force. While significant differences in policy exist globally, the global policy landscape is gradually moving closer towards the vision of global carbon pricing. This also offers significant potential for cooperation between different trading schemes, for instance in the form of linking. Encouraging such global cooperation needs to be a core priority for all stakeholders as pricing carbon globally is the most efficient remedy against carbon leakage.\nPage 1\n© EEX AG - part of eex group\nee\nWith the Green Deal, Europe is setting out to intensify its efforts in global climate diplomacy. We welcome this course as it can make a significant contribution to both increasing global climate action efforts and aligning them, thereby facilitating cooperation. Introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism, if well designed, can be one element in a suite of different policy initiatives and actions contributing to this. It must complemented by other elements, such as leading by example, intensifying outreach to global partners and supporting them in implementing climate policy.\nParticular attention in the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism should be paid to minimizing the risk of global trade disruptions. Such disruption could emerge from the mechanism itself, but also from retaliation measures by non-EU countries in reaction to the mechanism. It should be designed to comply with World Trade Organization rules and other international obligations of the EU. A carbon border adjustment mechanism should first focus on specific pilot sectors, to test the effectiveness of different policy configurations, and ensure the possibility to pivot towards other solutions leading to better results. This is particularly relevant given the high complexity of measuring the carbon content of imports.\nThe Roadmap for a Directive on a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism names several requirements for such policy. It is expected to ensure that the “price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content”. It also states that “the complementarity of the measure with internal carbon pricing, in particular the EU ETS, will also have to be assessed, as well as how it relates to the current measures to avoid the risk of carbon leakage. [...] The measure should be commensurate with the internal EU carbon price. Against the background of these policy objectives, EEX sees the following key principles for the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism should it be implemented:\nKey principles for a carbon border adjustment mechanism\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism should be as closely as possible integrated with the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

This policy approach has several significant advantages over alternatives, such as an import tax/tariff or product standards:\ne An inclusion of imports in the EU ETS would ensure full compatibility with carbon pricing in the EU and the existing energy and climate policy framework. The existing infrastructure of the EU ETS could be used for implementation. The price importers pay would be fully transparent and equal to what EU producers are paying, providing a clear and easily comparable measure for their efforts. They could rely on the liquid and efficient EU emission market to manage their exposure. Inclusion in the EU ETS provides an optimal basis for increasing cooperation between jurisdictions. Other regions would be encouraged to monitor and track emissions in line with the EU ETS, increasing compatibility between different climate policy regimes globally.\nThe introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism for a sector has to be linked to a gradual phase- out of free allocation. The policy objective of such mechanism is to provide an alternative to free allocation and counter some its disadvantages. For reducing administrative complexity, any mechanism should use existing standards, infrastructure and common EU benchmarks already used today for policies to limit carbon leakage.\nPage 2\n© EEX AG - part of eex group\nee\nA decrease in free allocation has to be matched with an increase in the auctioning share. Auctioning is the default allocation method for allowances in the EU ETS. It is the most transparent allocation method, providing a transparent, harmonised and non-discriminatory process. The principle of auctioning, and the objective of gradually moving to full auctioning, is fundamental to the objective of emissions trading as it guarantees costs of carbon are internalized. Auctioning revenues make a significant contribution to climate action in Europe. In 2018, revenues for the EU’s Common Auction Platform alone amounted to more than 14 billion Euros. Member States spent or planned to spend close to 70% of these revenues for specified climate and energy related purposes over the course of the year’.\nContact\nDaniel Wragge Director Political & Regulatory Affairs daniel.wragge@eex.com +49 30 59004 240\nTimo Schulz\nSenior Political & Regulatory Affairs Advisor\ntimo.schulz@eex.com\n+49 30 59004 243\nTransparency Register ID 09579576238-53\n1 Report the functioning of the European carbon market, COM/2019/557 final/2 on\nPage 3\n© EEX AG - part of eex group"

This summary is expanded upon in Ember’s attached report; and ClientEarth’s and Ember’s joint attached briefing, both of which form part of our submission.\nScope of the CBAM \n\nThe main objective of the CBAM is to fight climate change by tackling carbon leakage. The measure will be more effective if it captures leakage of GHGs such as methane. Therefore, we suggest replacing the term “carbon” with a broader term such as “emissions” or “GHG”. \n\nExisting and new methodologies should evolve where possible to capture GHGs. The CBAM should seek ways to overcome administrative burden and include measures that guarantee “ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries” per the roadmap.  \n\nThe CBAM should be assessed:\n•\tAs an alternative to the measures in the ETS that aim to address carbon leakage. Hence, it may nullify the need free allowances and indirect cost compensation if designed so as to ensure a level playing field between EU industries and their non-EU counterparts in relation to the price of carbon-intensive goods imported to the EU. \n•\tTo ensure compatibility with the Energy Taxation Directive under revision. \n•\tIn light of the New Industrial Strategy for Europe and the announced White Paper on an Instrument on Foreign Subsidies, as well as the update of the Industrial Emissions Directive.\n\nA CBAM can be compatible with WTO rules, for example Article II.2 or Article III.2 of the GATT. In any case, the CBAM could be justified under Article XX of the GATT exemption, and more specifically for the reasons described in paragraphs b (allowing measures for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health) and/or g (allowing measures for the conservation of exhaustible natural resources). As the CBAM objective is to combat climate change rather than to favour EU domestic products and services over foreign ones, it can be designed in a way not to constitute an arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.\n\nApplication\nThe measure should apply in the following areas of the energy sector: \n•\tTrade of electricity through interconnectors\nElectricity imported to the EU from non-EU countries through interconnectors is not subject to carbon pricing, and is often sourced from carbon-intensive power plants (e.g. Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Turkey, Morocco, Ukraine). Research by Ember shows that carbon leakage in electricity is already occurring, and a CBAM could be the only effective way to avoid this leakage. \n•\tFossil fuel imports to the EU\nThe EU’s importing of coal, fossil gas, LNG and oil involves significant risk of leakage given the emissions intensity of extracting, processing, storing and transporting those materials. Such emissions may not be properly accounted for due to lack of adequate legal climate frameworks, and so could cause GHG leakage.  The Commission should ensure the CBAM properly accounts for the emissions involved in these imports.\n\nForm\nThe roadmap and Ember in its report suggest several options for the mechanism. The choice of the most suitable and effective form should be based on compatibility with WTO rules, timing of the mechanism, adaptability and effectiveness. \n\nLegal basis and instrument\nAs the main purpose of the measure is to combat climate change, Article 192 of the TFEU seems to provide a more suitable legal basis than Article 207. To safeguard a higher level of harmonisation and coordination in a complex area, a regulation is preferred over a directive.\n\nFinal remarks\nThe CBAM will link to various areas of EU policy and legislation. We strongly recommend the CBAM is adopted through a transparent, close and meaningful cooperation with DG TAXUD with DGs CLIMA, TRADE, ENER,  COMP and ENV.     \nFinally, ClientEarth and Ember should be included in the specialised audience, which will participate in the more technical consultation.\nClie",
        "pdf_text": "ClientEarth and Ember joint feedback on the Roadmap for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)\nApplications in the energy sector\nWe welcome the European Commission’s proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM or ‘mechanism’) envisaged in the European Green Deal as a means to achieve the EU’s ambition of reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 50-55% by 2030. According to the Roadmap Impact Assessment for the CBAM (Roadmap), the mechanism should apply to sectors with the greatest levels of leakage. As such, this document highlights the need for immediate action to address emissions leakage caused by current policy, specifically in the energy sector.\nOutlined below are considerations and recommendations relating to the objective of the mechanism, its consistency with relevant law and policy, methodological issues, scope and legal form.\nObjective\nThe Roadmap notes the EU’s GHG reduction efforts could be negated by the lower climate ambition of non-EU trading partners, and that the CBAM could address this risk by avoiding carbon leakage. However, in order to genuinely reflect the EU’s climate ambition, the term “carbon leakage” should be broadened beyond referring only to carbon dioxide; it should incorporate leakage of other GHG emissions such as methane. This approach would make the CBAM consistent with other EU tools and policies contributing to the EU Paris Agreement commitments, such as the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), the Effort Sharing Regulation, and the New Industrial Strategy for Europe (Industrial Strategy).* Therefore, we suggest the term “carbon”’ in the CBAM should be replaced with a broader term capturing all greenhouse gases, such as “emissions” or “GHGs”.\nConsistency with EU law and policy\nThe relevant EU legal frameworks and policies dealing with GHG liability must be consistent. As recalled in the Roadmap, the European Green Deal envisages a CBAM “for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage”. The CBAM is considered an alternative to the measures in the ETS that aim to mitigate carbon leakage from certain sectors, such as the allocation of free allowances and compensation for indirect costs passed onto electro-intensive industries.\nThe CBAM may therefore nullify the need for ETS-related State aid; this is particularly clear for the allocation of free allowances. In this respect, the draft ETS State aid Guidelines provide that “[t]he Commission may decide to review or adapt these Guidelines at any time if this should be necessary for reasons associated with competition policy or in order to take account of other Union policies or international commitments.”? The implementation of the CBAM could be one such relevant policy.’ The purpose of the aid measures would indeed disappear if a CBAM were designed in such a manner as to ensure a level playing field between EU industries and their non-EU counterparts which export carbon-intensive goods to the EU.*\n1 Commission’s communication of 10 March 2020, COM(2020) 102 final:\nhttps ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-eu-industrial-strate -march-2020 en.pdf\n? https://ec.europa.eu/competition/consultations/2020 ets stateaid guidelines/consultance report.pdf at\npara. 67.\n3 See Annex 1 of the draft ETS State aid guidelines submitted to public consultation between 14 January and 10 March 2020:\nhttps ec.europa.eu/competition/consultations/2020 ets stateaid uidelines/draft_ets uidelines_en.pdf\n4 The stakeholders’ submissions to the public consultation not published the Commission’s website yet. are on See e.g. ClientEarth’s observations on the draft ETS State aid guidelines:\nIn relation to the ETD, we consider that the CBAM would not affect the need to revise this Directive in order to bring it in line with the 2030 energy targets and climate neutrality by 2050.° While both the CBAM and a reform of energy taxation can increase the price of GHGs and contribute to climate objectives, these tools have different geographical and material scopes, and are complementary. Therefore, we recommend that the two files be conducted in parallel and made compatible with one another.\nThe need for and scope of the CBAM should also be assessed in light of the Industrial Strategy. The CBAM should be implemented as a safeguard measure for EU industry, not a permanent remedy. Differences in ambition between the EU and third countries will likely persist in 2021, which is the deadline set by the Commission to introduce the CBAM. There will probably therefore be a genuine need for the CBAM. Nevertheless, EU industry must not be able to exploit the CBAM to reduce its duties to rapidly decarbonise, become energy efficient and invest in the technologies to enable this. Likewise, the CBAM should not undermine the ambition of the EU to support industrial evolution as per its industrial policy commitments.\nThe Commission is currently seeking feedback on its roadmap® for an update of the Industrial Emissions Directive (‘IED’). That roadmap proposes exploring the inclusion of decarbonisation of industry within the scope of the IED, which applies to large combustion plants, amongst over 50,000 industrial installations. As pressure increases on EU installations to decarbonise, it is essential that decarbonisation is also encouraged amongst industrial operators exporting to the EU, including via a CBAM\nA final point in relation to consistency with EU law and policy is that the CBAM’s rates and methodologies should adapt to variations in subsidies given to non-EU industries that are exporting carbon-intensive goods to the EU. This could be linked to the announced White Paper on an Instrument on Foreign Subsidies, which will address distortive effects caused by foreign subsidies within the single market.\nConsistency with WTO rules\nThe Roadmap notes the feasibility of the mechanism will need to be assessed against WTO rules. Our conclusion is that the CBAM could be consistent with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provisions and be taken for example on the basis of Article II.2 or Article III.2 of the GATT. A detailed analysis of these options goes beyond the scope of the present document.\nIn any case, the CBAM could be justified under Article XX of the GATT exemption, and more specifically for the reasons described in paragraphs b (allowing measures for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health) and/or g (allowing measures for the conservation of exhaustible natural resources). As the CBAM objective is to combat climate change rather than favour EU domestic products and services over foreign ones, it can be designed in a way not to constitute an arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, (which are prohibited under WTO law).\nTo strengthen the justification under the WTO rules, we suggest the following features in the CBAM design:\nhttps www.documents.clientearth.or, library/download-info/clientearths-response-to-the-consultation-on- the-draft-ets-state-aid-guidelines/\n5 Roadmap and consultation the ETD : https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your- on say/initiatives/12227-Revision-of-the-Energy-Tax-Directive-\n5 Roadmap and consultation the IED: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your- on say/initiatives/12306-EU-rules-on-industrial-emissions-revision\nMaintain a high level of transparency and consistently emphasise the climate-related purpose of the mechanism throughout the drafting process and adoption, application, monitoring and reporting of the measure once in place; Seek a negotiated but principled solution with affected countries; Provide importers the opportunity to prove their own emissions; Avoid entrenchment by prescribing an expiration date that can be extended to prevent further leakage if warranted; Use any revenues generated from the CBAM to promote decarbonisation and climate policies in third countries;’ Use Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) alone or with Article 207 TFEU as the legal basis for the measure.\nMethodology\nMethodological considerations relating to the energy sector are set out below:\ne Existing and new methodologies should evolve where possible to capture greenhouse gas emissions in the whole production and value chain at upstream, midstream and downstream level including, for example, emissions from transportation and extraction that are not otherwise captured. We understand that the Roadmap favours reducing administrative burden overall but recognises that “ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries may be needed”. We recommend that the CBAM seek ways to address administrative burden rather than compromising the effective assessment of emissions intensity. For example, for electricity imports, the methodology used to estimate the emissions intensity will be a crucial design choice for both the effectiveness and legality of the measure. Carbon intensity varies enormously by country and by hour. Tracking these variations would make an effective policy, but country-specific treatment may contravene the non-discrimination rules of the WTO (for example, GATT Article |). A compromise could be to use technology benchmarks, combined with detailed generation data and other relevant information already at hand such as market data on international exchanges. Regardless, the relatively simple value chain of electricity production should minimise administrative burden.\nCBAM in the energy sector\nWe recommend that the mechanism apply to the following areas of the energy sector.\n1. Trade of electricity through interconnectors\nInterconnectors are considered a key component of the clean energy transition as they enable better integration of renewables and fairer prices for consumers. However, the EU has interconnections with multiple neighbouring non-EU countries that produce carbon-intensive electricity. Electricity from these countries is not subject to carbon pricing, and is often sourced from power plants that do not comply with environmental standards commensurate with the EU (e.g. Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Turkey, Morocco, Ukraine).\nResearch by Ember shows that carbon leakage in electricity is already occurring, and could increase with growing disparity in climate ambition between the EU and neighbouring states as the level of interconnection increases.® As it is not possible to know the origin of electrons at their point of\n7 See for example https: ost.eu/eu-green-deal-meeting-targets- by-lowerin eu-neighbour- ener -non- emissions-too/.\n8 Chris Rosslowe, ‘The path of least how electricity generated from coal leaking the EU’ Dr resistance: is into Sandbag (January 2020), available at https://ember-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-SB-Path- of-least-resistance-1.2b DIGI.pdf.\nconsumption, a CBAM on electricity imports is the only effective way to avoid this leakage. A CBAM on electricity would have the added benefits of incentivising clean electricity in other countries and improving cross-border health benefits. However, precautions would need to be taken to ensure EU Member States do not abuse such a mechanism to restrict the application of Article 16(8) of Electricity Market Regulation? , which prescribe an obligation for Member States to increase the use of interconnection capacity, and thus electricity trade, by at least 70%\n2 Fossil fuel imports to the EU\nWhere the EU imports coal, fossil gas, LNG or oil, there is significant risk that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction, processing, storage, and transportation of those fossil fuels may not be properly accounted for and so cause GHG leakage.\nEvidence now shows that emissions from extraction, processing and transporting fossil gas, LNG and oil is extremely greenhouse gas intensive. Methane can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as carbon dioxide over a 20 year period. A recent study showed that anthropogenic methane emissions, mainly from the oil and gas sector, have been underestimated by up to 40%.”° The processing and transport of LNG further increases greenhouse damage due to the level of methane leakage - Robert Howarth of Cornell University estimates that shale gas LNG imported to Ireland would have a greenhouse gas footprint at least 44% higher than that of coa |.24\nIn terms of coal, EU producers may be subject to stricter regulation and therefore higher carbon liability than neighbouring export countries. For example, methane emissions from mining are accounted for through the Effort Sharing Regulation 2018/842, meaning that coal production emissions would be covered by the EU's broad climate target. The CBAM could therefore level the playing field between coal producers in the EU and those from neighbouring countries in terms of such regulation and carbon liability.\nAs the EU develops infrastructure for increased importation of fossil gas, LNG and oil, and continues to import coal from countries such as Russia, stopping GHG border leakage will be critical. In order to avoid perverse incentives for the use of imported fossil fuels, the Commission, as part of its announced methane strategy, should ensure the CBAM properly accounts for the emissions involved in these imports.\nCBAM form\nThe Roadmap outlines three options for the form of the CBAM. The choice of form should take into account the following criteria.\nCompatibility with WTO rules: Extension of existing schemes, which apply to producers based within the EU, would have better prospects of passing the WTO test. Implementing the CBAM in this way would help show that the measures do not introduce discrimination against imported products. For example, the areas discussed in this submission could be regulated through changes to the ETS or the ETD. Timing: The review of related EU legislation such as the ETS and the ETD offer an opportunity to adopt the complementary CBAM by 2021;\n° Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 the internal on market for electricity\n10 Benjamin Hmiel et al, ‘Preindustrial 14CH4 indicates greater anthropogenic fossil CH4 emissions’ Nature (20\nFebruary 2020) Vol 578.\n1 Testimony of Robert W. Howarth, Ph.D. Cornell University before the Joint Committee Climate Action on House of Oireachtas, Ireland 9 October 2019.\n3. Adaptability: The selected form should be amenable to quick adjustment as a response to the increase of climate ambition in non-EU countries; 4 Effectiveness: An effective mechanism should: a Minimise risk of carbon price gaming; b Prevent resource shuffling, whereby exporters reduce their climate obligation by substituting electricity with lower carbon intensity, while exporting high-carbon electricity with other trade partners; Prevent bypass and semi-finished goods, whereby carbon related taxes may be avoided by producing and exporting semi-finished goods.’\nRevenues\nAs mentioned above, CBAM revenues should be used in a similar way to the ETS: to promote EU climate and energy policies, and support decarbonisation efforts and climate policies in third countries. Emphasis should be on the latter, given the Green Deal envisages the EU taking a leading role in the climate change fight. In addition, to mitigate possible negative social impacts, the Commission should consider distributing CBAM revenues to any vulnerable customers affected by price increases (in electricity or other goods) , as well as to support just transition initiatives in those areas, where local economies might be particularly impacted by rising costs of energy.\nLegal basis and instrument\nAs the main purpose of the measure is to combat climate change, Article 192 of the TFEU seems to provide a more suitable legal basis alone or together with Article 207 of the TFEU. To safeguard a higher level of harmonisation and coordination in a complex area, a regulation would be preferred over a directive.\nFinal remarks\nThe CBAM will interact with multiple areas of EU policy and legislation. We strongly recommend the measure be adopted following transparent, close and meaningful cooperation with DG TAXUD with DGs CLIMA, TRADE, ENER, COMP and ENV.\nIn addition to the general public consultation, ClientEarth and Ember request that we be included in the specialised audience to participate in the technical consultation.\n?For more detail on the above criteria on effectiveness please see Adam Whitmore, ”The ABC of BCAs: An overview of the issues around introducing Border Carbon Adjustments in the EU”, Sandbag (December 2019), available at https://ember-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-SB-Border-Adjustments DIGI-1.pdf\n5\nE PATH OF\nLEAST RESISTAN\nHow electricity generated from coal i eaking into the E\nWeal Sp\nVia GS!)\nww ip Vi NN\nLS, mK\nhis SS YW\nSs aN ty\nZ\n4\nI\nIp\neS QZ |\n“ol\nWY, lg)\nmi LE\nRD V4 ra ) RK\n=H ii Sz > As\nL i<\n(\ni\n«| A\nA a\nig\n<i\nFi (Baas %, S|\n— Ui ae NE\n= r Ibe ca mais A >\n[is\nSS\nge\nBZ\nvA aa\nDA | /\ni\" Ni\nNS\nr\\ Be v_IN au’\na=\n— 3 SS\n= TPs\nrx PS\na\nsandba 9g\nsmarter climate policy\ny\nMog\nA\na\nsandba g\nsmarter climate policy\nPublished in January 2020 by Sandbag.

We reveal that countries covered by the EU carbon price are increasingly importing electricity, and many new links are planned. Allowing this carbon leakage to continue will undermine EU emissions cuts, as well as incentivising further use of coal in neighbouring countries, turning them into ‘offshore carbon havens’.\nThe solution is to apply a carbon price on electricity imports - also Known as a border carbon adjustment (BCA). Applying a BCA for electricity is easier than for other internationally traded products (i.e. steel or cement), as flows of electricity are transparent, and the relatively simple production chain allows tracing of carbon emissions. Without ETS free-allocation, administration is easier, and trade politics are far simpler. A border carbon adjustment on electricity would not only restore the integrity of EU climate policy, but also incentivise low-carbon electricity generation in neighbouring states, and the spread of carbon pricing.\nThis report analyses:\ne How much CO2 leakage is there from electricity today? What growth in imports should we expect? Could a carbon border adjustment on electricity work to reduce carbon leakage?\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nKey findings\nCountries in the EU ETS are increasingly importing electricity. Net imports were up from 3TWh in 2017 to 21TWh in 2019. All the imports are from countries that have zero or near-zero carbon pricing. Imported electricity emitted an estimated 26 million tonnes of CO2 - more than the annual emissions of Italy’s coal fleet. Generating the same volume of electricity in the importing EU member states would have emitted 11 million tonnes less, as their power grids are lower carbon on average. Gross electricity imports in 2019 were worth €1.6bn. Had they paid the EU ETS carbon price, this would have generated revenue of €630m. Plans exist to increase interconnection capacity between EU and non- EU countries by 31%, further exposing EU power markets to imports. 15% of this expansion is with the Western Balkans, home to Europe’s most polluting power stations. New coal power (up to 57GW) is being planned or constructed in countries connected, or soon to be connected to EU power grids. This would mean a 53% increase in coal capacity in connected countries as a whole. Most is planned in Turkey (34GW), Egypt (11GW), Bosnia & Herzegovina (4GW), and Serbia (2GW). By 2025, five additional non-EU countries - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Israel, and Moldova - could be connected with EU member states. None of these have a carbon price.\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nWhich EU member states are most exposed?\nOf the 13 EU countries connected to a non-EU neighbour, some are particularly exposed to coal power imports. This is because they have ample interconnection with neighbours operating (or planning) large coal fleets, while themselves pursuing more ambitious decarbonisation. The key countries at risk are:\ne Greece, which will phase out coal by 2028, but is connected to Europe's largest coal developer Turkey, and plans to connect with the fossil fuel- heavy grid of Egypt. Finland, the largest importer of electricity in the EU - all from the fossil- heavy Russian grid. Spain, where domestic coal generation is collapsing, but imports of coal power from Morocco are rising, and more interconnection is planned. Croatia, which has proposed high renewable electricity targets for 2030, but is heavily integrated with the grid of Bosnia & Herzegovina, which is actively developing coal. Romania, which has the third highest interconnection capacity with non- EU neighbours, is expanding interconnection with Ukraine, and planning new connections with coal-powered Turkey and Moldova. Hungary, which intends to move beyond domestic fossil generation almost entirely by 2030, yet is the largest EU importer of carbon intensive electricity from Ukraine.\nPolicy recommendation\nWe propose a border carbon adjustment (BCA) on gross electricity imports into the EU ETS region. This would defend the integrity of EU climate policy by preventing offshoring of power sector emissions. It would also create an incentive for neighbouring states to decarbonise and/or align climate policies, accelerating the spread of carbon pricing. We offer some design recommendations, to reduce carbon leakage effectively, mitigate unintended consequences, and minimise the risk of legal challenge.\nNew European Commission President von der Leyen has put forward border carbon adjustments as part of a green deal for Europe. We believe the power sector is the best place to start implementing such a policy.\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nContents\nExecutive summary\nHow much carbon is leaking into the EU?\nElectricity flows Carbon emissions from traded electricity\nWhat changes in imports can we expect?\nA Border Carbon Adjustment on Electricity\nOverview Turkey — Greece & Bulgaria Morocco «+ Spain & Portugal Ukraine < Hungary / Romania / Poland / Slovakia Western Balkans « Greece / Croatia / Hungary / Romania / Bulgaria Egypt « Cyprus & Greece\n13\n13\n18\n20\n22\n25\n27\n20\nReferences\nAnnex 1: Annual electricity trade data\n55\n56\nHow much-carbon is:leaking int Qs.\nthe EU2/\n%\nInterconnectors are undoubtedly effective at lowering electricity costs and reducing curtailment of renewables. However, a disparity in carbon pricing at the border of the EU is creating a competitive advantage for high-carbon generators in neighbouring countries. In this section we analyse the effect this is having on electricity imports and associated carbon emissions.\nElectricity flows\nThe trade flows considered in this analysis are between the block of countries participating in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS, i.e., EU member states plus Norway and Switzerland), and any neighbouring country not in this block. In total, 13 EU countries are physically connected with 11 non-EU countries.\nThe ENTSO-E Transparency Platform’ pubishes hourly flows of electricity between these countries”. We cross-checked this dataset against the ENTSO-E’s Grid Map? of Europe, and found hourly exchange data exists for all relevant interconnections, except Morocco to Spain, for which we retrieved equivalent data through the Red Eléctrica de Espafia eSIOS platform’.\nThe EU ETS region is a net importer of electricity. Figure 1 shows that every year since 2015, the EU ETS region has imported 3-21TWh more than it has exported. The highest gross and net imports have come in the last two years, simultaneous with the increase in the EU ETS carbon price. The net import in 2019 was 21TWh, or 0.6% of EU electricity demand (3256TWh in 20165). Annual figures are provided in Table 1.\n1. ENTSO-E Transparency platform.\n2.

A total of 33TWh was imported. The majority (79%) originated from just three regions: Russia (38%), Ukraine (22%), and the Western Balkans (19%). Imports were received mostly by 4 EU countries: Finland (23%), Lithuania (17%), Greece (17%), and Hungary (13%).\nOnly 12.6TWh was exported in 2019 (Figure 1). The biggest exporting member states by far were Bulgaria (40%) and Slovakia (23%).\nTaking into account both imports and exports, the EU ETS countries with the largest net imports were Finland (8TWh), Lithuania (S5TWh), Greece (5TWh), and Hungary (4TWh). Trade with the Western Balkans was high in both directions, with 6.3TWh imported and 6.9TWh exported by the EU. Annex 1 contains full data for country-country exchanges in 2019, and the full multi-year dataset can be explored on our website.\nIn Figure 3, we show how exchanges with individual neighbouring countries have changed over time. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Bosnia & Herzegovina have been consistent exporters to the EU since 2015. Morocco became a net exporter to Spain for the first time in 2019. Gross imports from Morocco to the Iberian peninsula grew from almost nothing in 2018 (0.18TWh) to 1.2TWh in 2019.\nThe average ETS carbon price rose from approximately €6 in 2017 to €16 and €25 in 2018 and 2019 respectively. This is a cost that EU generators face, but electricity imports do not. We find that between 2017 and 2018, net imports increased from 8 out of 9 non-EU countries (Turkey being the only to decrease).\nAs well as volume, ENTSO-E publishes the hourly price of electricity in each EU country. We multiplied the hourly price by the hourly import flows to calculate the value of electricity imports in every country. We found that the total value of gross imports in 2019 was €1.6bn. Despite having the third largest imports by volume, Greece was the largest EU importer by value, importing €366m in 2019, up from €259m and €338m in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In terms of origin, €549m was purchased from Russia, €370m from Ukraine, €363m from the Western Balkans.\nThis means that in 2019, 33TWh of electricity worth €1.6bn was imported into the EU ETS region, having been generated in an effective carbon price haven.\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\n\nEU electricity imports from neighbouring countries\nAlbania\nBelarus\n1500\n1000\n500\n0)\n500\nBosnia & Herzegovina\nMorocco\nNorth Macedonia\nRussia\n1500\n1000\n500\n0 Sat ere\n500\nSerbia\nTurkey\nUkraine\n1500\n1000\n500 7h ryt ee\nmae,\nMarne.\n0\n500\nx\n©\nRy\n©\n%\nS\n©\n%\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nN\nVv\nN\nS\nN\nS\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nVv\nNet monthly imports to all EU member states from different non-EU countries, for the period January 2015 to December 2019 inclusive.\n\nAnnual electricity trade, and associated carbon emissions, between countries in the EU ETS and connected neighbours.\nYear\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nImport\n26.8\n29.0\n25.9\n36.1\n33.3\nElectricity\nExport\n23.8\n20.8\n22.8\n16.8\n12.6\n( TWh) a\nImport\n21.5\n23.2\n20.3\n29.2\n25.6\nCarbon\nExport\n12.0\n10.2\n10.9\n8.5\n6.0\n(MtCO2)\nNet\n9.5\n13.0\n9.4\n20.7\n19.6\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nCarbon emissions from traded electricity\nOf the 11 connected non-EU countries, only Ukraine has any form of carbon pricing applying to electricity generation (currently set at €0.31/tCO2). In comparison, electricity generators in the EU ETS must surrender allowances to cover their carbon emissions, which in 2019 cost approximately €25/tCO2. In this section, we ask: how much unpriced COQ2 is being emitted in connected countries to satisfy the demand of EU imports?\nThere is sufficient open data to quantify volume and value of electricity trade, but estimating the resulting carbon emissions is more difficult. It requires knowledge of the carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh) of electricity flowing through each interconnector. Such an estimate is not straightforward, because the electricity is rarely traceable to a specific power plant, and even if it were, the carbon intensity of an individual power plant is not easily available. The best approximation would use the carbon intensity of the marginal generating unit at the time of export. However, despite recent efforts [1], this remains a challenging calculation, beyond the scope of this report.\nWe followed a simplified approach, estimating the average carbon intensity of the exporting country’s electricity supply. For this calculation®’ we took the annual CO2 emissions from each country’s power sector (EDGAR? v5, data for 2018), and divided this by total annual electricity generation (IEA). While sufficient for this analysis, this method could be improved upon in several ways. For example, an hourly estimate could be achieved by combining the hourly flow data with the hourly generation mix in each exporting country. Combining this with an assumed carbon intensity for each generating technology would then provide an hourly average carbon intensity of electricity generation. ENTSO-E publishes such hourly generation data for some, but not all countries considered in this analysis.\n6. All Imports into Lithuania are from the Kaliningrad enclave, which has a different generation mix to Russia as a whole. The largest power stations in Kaliningrad are the gas-fired Kaliningradskaya (QOOMW) and Pregolskaya (455MW). We therefore adopted an assumed carbon intensity for gas power stations of 500gCO2/kWh [2].\n7. We took a slightly different approach to Ukraine, due to its segregated grid structure. Hungary and Slovakia are connected to the ‘Burshtyn island’, a section of grid disconnected from the rest of Ukraine since 2002, operating synchronously with its ENTSO-E neighbours, and dominated by the Burshtyn (2.3GW) coal plant. Similarly, the connection with Poland is specifically with the Dobrotvirska (510MW) coal plant. For exports through these connections we use carbon intensities of these individual plants taken from the literature [3].\n8.

We find that out of the 21 cross-border interconnectors, 17 serve to connect an EU grid to a higher carbon intensity non-EU grid, with just 4 doing the opposite. Moreover, 8 of the 10 connections carrying the largest gross imports into the EU do so from a higher-carbon grid.\nGiven the EU ETS region is a net importer of electricity, and connected grids are predominantly higher carbon intensity, it follows that it is also a net importer of carbon. We estimate that in 2019, the EU ETS region imported 26MtCO2 while exporting 6MtCO2, i.e., a net import of 2OMtCO2. This net import of CO2 has doubled since 2017. Approximatley 35% of gross CO2 imported in 2019 originated from Russia, followed by 27% from Ukraine and 20% from the Western Balkans.\nx\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nCountries in the EU ETS collectively imported 26MtCO2 in 2019 (20MtCO2 net), equivalent to the annual emissions of the Italian coal fleet’®.\nIt's clear that significant and increasing amounts of high-carbon electricity is entering the EU via a number of routes. These dynamics are highly suggestive of carbon leakage in the EU ETS. What’s driving this leakage? More detailed modelling of connected grids would be required to answer definitively. However, it can only be encouraged by the sharp disparity in the price of carbon at the border of the EU, combined with ample interconnection providing generators on either side access to the same markets. This view is supported by the observed increase in net imports in 2018 and 2019, simultaneous with the increase in EU ETS carbon price.\nIf gross electricity imports had been subject to the EU ETS carbon price on a real-time basis in 2019, additional costs would have totalled €630m.\nThis works out as an average of €19/MWh (€630m/33TWh). This is indicative of the cost advantage enjoyed by generators in the EU’s 13 neighbouring countries, which will be higher for high-carbon generators such as coal power plants. The avoided carbon costs of €630m are not insignificant compared to total ETS auction revenues, which were €14bn in 2018\".\nElectricity used in EU countries, but generated outside of the EU ETS, avoided €630m of carbon costs in 2019.\nAllowing this to continue risks undermining decarbonisation objectives in the affected EU states, and beyond. As EU member states attempt to decarbonise their power sectors, interconnectors tapping in to cheap, high-carbon electricity risks emissions being exported rather than genuinely reduced. The EU's target to increase interconnection between member states to 15% by 2030 could expose more member states - beyond those considered here - to the same risks of carbon leakage.\nIn the following section we show that without policy intervention to prevent carbon leakage, divergence in energy policy (i.e., decarbonisation ambition) combined with increases in interconnection, means the problem is only likely to get worse.\n10. Emissions in 2018 were 25.3MtCO2 based on EU ETS data from the European Union Transaction Log, via Europe Beyond Coal.\n11.

A 2018 EU study [4] provides the total interconnection capacity of every EU country with its non-EU neighbours. These capacities are not always fully available for exchange, because in price-coupled areas such as those encompassed by ENTSO-E, capacity for (day-ahead) trade is allocated based on the optimum market solution. However, given the objective of this process is usually to maximise trade between price zones, to even prices, the physical capacity should be a reasonable approximation of what is made available. We compared these total connection capacities to the total physical energy flows observed in 2018, to estimate interconnector utilisation for each non- EU country. Our estimates ranged from 5-41%, with an overall utilisation of 13%. Albania had the highest (the only one above 20%), and Belarus the lowest. On this basis we conclude that spare interconnection capacity exists with every presently connected non-EU country.\n12\nWhat changes in imports can we\nexpect?\nOverview\nIn the previous section we established that high-carbon electricity is leaking into the EU, through interconnections with non-EU states that predominantly generate electricity with a higher carbon intensity. In this section we explore the future of interconnection, and power sector development in connected countries, to assess the future of carbon leakage without policy intervention.\nMore interconnectors are planned. To assess developments in interconnection, we consulted the ENTSO-E Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), the EU Commission list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI), and national energy strategies. In Figure 5 we present a map of all existing and planned interconnectors between EU (ETS) and non-EU countries. We found that by 2030, interconnection capacity between EU and non-EU countries is planned to increase by 31%. This expansion will connect 2 additional EU ETS countries (Cyprus, Portugal) and 5 additional non-EU countries (Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Moldova’). In Figure 6 we summarise the increases that are planned between 14 pairs of countries. It can be seen that 10 out of 14 of these pairs involve a non- EU country with higher carbon intensity electricity than its EU counterpart. Figure 7 and Table 2 provide a full breakdown of current and future interconnection capacity with each neighbouring country.\nMore coal plants are also planned, in countries connected or soon-to-be connected to the EU. Using data from Global Energy Monitor on coal power development (July 2019) [5], we found that connected or soon-to-be connected countries are collectively planning 57GW of new coal capacity’. The largest developers are Egypt, Turkey, Serbia, and Bosnia & Herzegovina. A full breakdown by country is given in Figure 7, and values can be found in Table 2.\n12. Power lines already connect Romania and Moldova, but these are not in operation. A project to restore the connection to 600MW was identified as a Project of Mutual Interest in 2016 in the framework of Energy Community.\n13.

We assessed power sector developments in connected countries, using draft National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs, EU) or Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs, non-EU), as well as national strategy documents. We found that some of the largest importers of electricity, such as Finland, Greece, and Croatia, also have the most ambitious power decarbonisation plans. Six EU countries: Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, and Finland, have committed to phasing-out coal power domestically before 2030, but will remain exposed to non-EU coal power imports after this date without policy intervention. In general, decarbonisation progress in EU countries risks being undermined if imports of coal electricity continue to have a competitive advantage. Climate goals will be thwarted if emissions are exported rather than genuinely saved.\nFrom here, we focus our analysis on five regions that strongly exhibit the problems outlined above:\ne Turkey < Greece / Bulgaria Morocco <> Spain Ukraine < Poland / Slovakia / Hungary / Romania Western Balkans <> Croatia / Hungary / Romania / Bulgaria / Greece Egypt <> Greece\nWe do not provide further analysis on Russia or Belarus, despite both being major sources of electricity imports to the EU. In brief, the Baltic states - importers of Russian and Belarusian electricity - are seeking to reduce their reliance on these imports, instead pursuing projects to synchronise their networks with the EU grid by 2025. The other major recipient of Russian electricity is Finland, which has no plans to increase interconnection capacity with Russia. The increase in imports is partly caused by the delays in commissioning the Olkiluoto-3 nuclear reactor, which is currently due to connect to the Finnish grid in summer 2020.\n17\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nTurkey <> Greece & Bulgaria\n\nSchematic map of interconnection between Turkey and neighbouring EU member states\n=\nRO\nCapacity (GW)\n@ 1\n@2\n@:;\nCoal plants\nMK\n@\nOperating\n© Planned\ngCO./kWh\n1000\n@ @\n750\n500\nGR\na £\n250\n7\nYD\"\nTR\na\nrN\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation. All cross-border power lines are represented as a single line, with total transfer capacity indicated (GW). Planned connections (dashed) are shown in red. Points indicate operating and planned coal power stations in Turkey (GEM).\nCurrent trade\nTurkey exported 2.8TWh of electricity to its EU neighbours in 2019 (2.7TWh to Greece, 0.1TWh to Bulgaria), worth €177m. Turkey was the 4th largest source of electricity imports to the EU ETS, and Greece the 3rd largest importer. We estimate gross imports from Turkey accounted for 5% of all CO2 from electricity imports. Over the same period, Turkey imported 1.1TWh almost entirely from Bulgaria, making it a net exporter to the EU, and almost a pure exporter to Greece. This is suggestive of a potential flow loop, with Bulgaria exporting to Greece, via Turkey. However, even if this is the case, the majority of Turkish exports to Greece must originate in Turkey.\nEnergy development plans\nUsing data from 2018, we estimate that Turkey has a slightly lower average grid intensity than both Greece and Bulgaria. In its 2012 energy efficiency strategy,\n18\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nTurkey announced a target to reduce the intensity of its electricity by 20% by 2023, however, an 2016 IEA\" review found “no concrete steps taken”. Instead, renewable energy installations have stalled, and a radical increase in coal capacity is planned. According to GEM, an enormous 34GW of coal power is at some stage of planning, adding to 19GW already operational, and placing Turkey third behind only China and India in its intent to add new coal capacity. This has already started, with 7GW permitted or under construction.\nIn contrast, power sector emissions in Greece are declining (approx 40% between 2007-2016), and further decarbonisation plans have been outlined. These include phasing-out all 4GW of coal power by 2028\", and a commitment to increase the share of renewable electricity consumption to 61% by 2030. The latter will require significant investment. The carbon intensity of Bulgaria's electricity will likely fall steadily, with the latest NECP draft’® recommending a 27% share of renewable generation by 2030 (up from 15% in 2017), and no new coal capacity planned.\nFuture of interconnection\nTurkey is connected to neighbouring EU member states with a substantial 4.4GW capacity (1.9GW Greece, 2.5GW Bulgaria). This means that after retiring its own coal fleet, Greece could feasibly import half the same capacity from Turkey. While our research revealed no plans to increase capacity with Greece or Bulgaria, we estimate both existing lines have spare capacity, with both operating at less than 20% of the physical maximum in 2018 (see Box 1). A new 7OOMW sub-sea connection with Romania has been proposed (Figure 8), and was included in Romania’s energy strategy for 2011-2020.\nCarbon pricing in Turkey?\nAn Emissions Trading Scheme is being considered. So far the Government has only adopted legislation for monitoring, reporting and verification (in 2012), with monitoring commencing in 2016 [6].\nSummary\nTurkey is a net electricity exporter to the EU, almost entirely to Greece. We estimate these exports emitted over 1.3 million tonnes CO2 last year. Unlike generators in Greece, Turkish power stations do not face a carbon price, and are unlikely to for several years. The power sectors of Greece and Turkey are quickly\n14.

Sufficient interconnection capacity exists to replace a substantial amount of Greece's retiring coal fleet with coal imports from Turkey, repeating the pattern seen with Spain and Morocco. A border carbon adjustment on electricity would remove the cost advantage for coal generators in Turkey, hence reducing carbon leakage, while protecting investments in renewables in Greece.\nMorocco <> Spain & Portugal\n\nSchematic map of interconnection between Morocco and neighbouring EU member states\nES\n/\n/\nPT\n‘\ngCO,/kWh\nSS\n. 600\nOn4)\n400\nCapacity (GW)\n@:\nMA\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation. The capacity of cross-border power lines is indicated (GW). Planned connections (dashed) are shown in red. Points indicate operating coal power stations in Morocco (GEM).\nCurrent trade\nEurope's only existing connection with North Africa is via subsea cables to Morocco. Until late 2018, these predominantly carried power from Spain to Morocco, however the direction has now reversed. From 2018 to 2019, net imports to Spain increased by 4.2TWh from -3.4TWh to 0.8TWh. Over the same period,\n20\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nSpain reduced domestic coal generation by a much larger 24.6TWh\"’, meaning the interconnector is far from fully compensating for this. However, coal power in Morocco will out-live that in Spain, risking many more years of carbon leakage.\nFuture of interconnection\nTwo subsea cables with a combined 1.4GW connect Spain and Morocco. A memorandum of understanding was signed in February 2019 to build a third, 7OOMW cable, commissioned ‘before 2026. A new 1GW connection between Morocco and Portugal has also been proposed\", with feasibility studies supposedly concluding in 2019, and completion possible before 2030. If delivered, these projects would increase the interconnection capacity between Morocco and the EU by 120%, to 3.1GW by 2030. However, recognising the threat of coal power imports, the energy ministers of both Spain and Portugal have raised concerns about the lack of carbon pricing at the border.\nEnergy development plans\nWe estimate the carbon\nintensity electricity Spain's (using 2017 data). The opening of the 1.4GW Safi coal plant in Morocco in December 2018 has likely increased that gap. How is this likely to develop? Morocco pledges in its INDC to limit total GHG growth to 24-57% between 2010 and 2030, and in the power sector is aiming for 52% renewable electricity by 2030'°. Spain has a head-start, and is set to proceed much faster. Their draft NECP outlines an ambitious target of 74% renewable electricity by 2030, rising to 100% by 2050. Electricity generated in Portugal has a slightly higher carbon intensity than Spain, but still far below Morocco. Portugal also plans to decarbonise swiftly, phasing-out its 2GW remaining coal power by 2023, and growing renewable electricity to 80% by 2030. These renewables in Portugal and Spain will mostly satisfy domestic demand, and are unlikely to export to Morocco due to the correlation with wind and solar there. This means the main function of the interconnector will likely become importing Moroccan coal power in periods of high demand when solar or wind are not producing.\nof Morocco’s\nis twice that of\nSummary\nBetween 2018 and 2019, Spain reduced domestic coal generation by 25TWh, yet increased net imports from Morocco by 4TWh. This is a clear sign of carbon leakage. On average, the imported electricity was twice as carbon intensive as the domestic supply, but no price was paid on these emissions, and carbon pricing is\n17.

The differing speed of decarbonisation in Morocco compared to Spain and Portugal means the carbon intensity gap is likely to grow in the 2020s, and the interconnectors will continue to import coal power. Simultaneously, the proposed expansion of interconnection risks the Iberian becoming more exposed to coal, offsetting GHG emissions saved by domestic power decarbonisation and coal phase-out. A border carbon adjustment would protect against this, and support the deployment of clean alternatives in all three countries.\nUkraine < Hungary / Romania / Poland / Slovakia\n\nSchematic map of interconnection between Ukraine and neighbouring EU member states\nPL\nHU\nRO\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation.

In 2019, Ukraine exported 7.2TWh to these countries, and imported 3.0TWh, making it a net exporter to the EU. Electricity imports from Ukraine accounted for 22% by volume, but 27% in terms of CO2 emissions. As shown in Figure 2, the largest net flow from Ukraine is into Hungary, followed by Romania and Poland, whereas Slovakia provides nearly all flows in the other direction. It’s possible this electricity flowing into Ukraine from Slovakia is in transit to a third country, e.g., Romania, rather than a genuine import by Ukraine, which would make Ukraine an even more significant exporter to the EU.\nFuture of interconnection\nUkraine has the largest interconnection capacity with EU neighbours of any non- EU country (Table 2). A small increase in the interconnection with Slovakia is planned, in the form of a new 400kV line. Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary are connected to the so-called ‘Burshtyn island’, a section of grid disconnected from the rest of Ukraine since 2002, operating synchronously with its ENTSO-E neighbours, and dominated by the Burshtyn (2.3GW) and Kalush (200MW) coal power plants. Romania and Hungary have second connections to the main (eastern) grid of Ukraine. The connection with Poland allows access specifically to Ukraine’s 510MW Dobrotvirska coal power plant, and has only flowed in the direction of Poland (since 2015). This means Ukrainian electricity exports to\nHungary, Poland and Slovakia are almost entirely coal powered.\nEnergy development plans\nUkraine as a whole has a substantial 21.8GW of operational coal capacity, with a further 660MW at the pre-permit stage in the eastern section of its network, connected with Romania and Hungary. In 2017, coal had a 32% share of generation, with the remainder largely from nuclear (55%), hydro (7%), and natural gas (5%) (IEA). However, as explained above, most connections with the EU are with coal-dominated sections of grid. The Burshtyn and Dobrotvirska power stations have emissions factors of 1080 and 1110g/kWh respectively [3], meaning they generate some of the highest carbon electricity in Europe. Given the Burshtyn island represents the first step toward integrating the wider Ukrainian grid with ENTSO-E, the Burshtyn power station is expected to remain operational for the foreseeable future.\n23\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nThe dominant importer of this extremely high-carbon electricity from Ukraine is Hungary. They have announced the phase-out of all 1GW of coal by 2030, and plan to increase the share of renewable electricity to 20% by the same year (from 7% in 2016), eventually moving beyond fossil generation completely. Next is\nRomania, which also generates lower carbon electricity than Ukraine. Slovakia has also announced a coal phase-out, with its remaining 800MW retiring by 2023.\nCarbon pricing in Ukraine?\nIn 2014, the Ukrainian government signed an EU Association Agreement’, obliging them to develop an emissions trading scheme within 2 years of it coming into force, which happened on 1st September 2017. This scheme is yet to materialise. Ukraine does however have a functioning carbon tax, which applies to power generation. As of 1st January 2019, the government agreed to increase the rate from UAH0.41/tCO2 to a still very low UAH10/tCO2 (€0.31/tCO2), and communicated an intention to increase it by UAH5 per year to reach UAH30 (~€1/ tC02) in 20232\".\nSummary\nConnections of Hungary and Poland with Ukraine are being used to import some of Europe’s highest carbon electricity into the EU. The carbon price paid on this electricity at the point of generation is a tiny fraction of what would be paid in neighbouring EU member states. The strong disparity in carbon price at the border with Ukraine is expected to persist, and gap in carbon intensities across these connections is expected to widen. Ukraine continues to operate heavily polluting thermal power plants, while the main importer of this - Hungary - aims to phase-out coal and increase its share of renewable electricity by 2030. The coal phase-out in Slovakia might also cause this trade flow to flip, risking further Carbon leakage.\n20. https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/november/tradoc_155103.pdf 21.

All cross-border power lines are represented as a single line, with total capacity indicated (GW). New connections (dashed) and planned increases are shown in red. Points indicate coal power stations in the Western Balkans (existing and planned, GEM).\nCurrent trade\nThe Western Balkans (WB) exported 6.3 TWh to the EU in 2019, ranking it third - as a group - behind Russia and Ukraine. Over the same period, 6.9TWh was imported from EU neighbours, making WB a net importer overall. The largest flows into the EU occurred across the borders of North Macedonia/Greece (2.7T Wh) and Bosnia & Herzegovina/Croatia (1.6TWh). The largest flows into the WB occurred across the borders of Bulgaria/North Macedonia (1.8TWh), Bulgaria/Serbia (1.3TWh), and Romania/Serbia (1.0TWh).\nSl\n25\nHU\nCOs\n®\nRO\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nDespite being a net importer of electricity by volume, the Western Balkans are a net exporter in terms of CO2 emissions to the EU. We estimate the 6.3TWh supplied to the EU by the WB emitted 5.2MtCO2, or 20% of CO2 from all electricity imports. On the other hand, EU exports to WB emitted 3.6MtCO2. This reflects the large differences in carbon intensity across EU/non-EU borders in this region, with Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina among the most carbon intensive considered in this analysis.\nFuture of interconnection\nThe WB already has a large 13.8GW interconnection capacity with EU neighbours (Table 2). Our research revealed plans for 2GW of new interconnection capacity. This includes additional lines connecting Serbia and Croatia, North Macedonia and Greece, and an eventual upgrade (to 1.2GW) of the recently commissioned 600MW connection between Montenegro and Italy.\nEnergy development plans\nCoal power projects totalling 6.3GW are at some stage of planning in the WB, representing an 86% increase on the 7.3GW already operational. Bosia & Herzegovina accounts for 4.1GW of this planned coal capacity, while their INDC outlines only a modest annual 3% increase in the share of renewable electricity, from around 25% (in 2017, IEA). The remaining planned coal capacity is mostly in Serbia, which has a similar share of renewable electricity to Bosnia & Herzegovina, and has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2030. Macedonia’s GHG emissions increase under all scenarios in their INDC, with no target set for renewable electricity, currently providing ~23% (2017, IEA). It is therefore likely that fossil sources will continue to dominate power generation in these countries until at least 2025. Looking towards countries likely to be importing high-carbon electricity from WB, Greece and Croatia have stated their intentions to increase renewable electricity to 61% and 64%, respectively, by 2030. Greece has also pledged to phase-out coal power entirely by 2028.\nRecently connected Italy has announced a coal phase-out by 2025, and aims to increase its share of renewable electricity to 55% by 2030 (from 40% in 2018, IEA).\nMontenegro generates a similar share of electricity from renewables, but the rest is entirely coal, meaning the grid intensity is higher. This gap is likely to increase as decarbonisation proceeds faster in Italy.\nSummary\nThe Western Balkans are well connected to EU neighbours, and electricity trades are relatively large in both directions. Despite being a net importer of electricity from EU neighbours, WB are a net exporter of carbon emissions, due\n26\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nto high grid intensities. The energy and climate targets of WB countries indicate that fossil sources will continue to dominate power generation until at least 2025. Meanwhile, the largest EU importers of WB electricity (Greece, Croatia, and potentially Italy) have declared ambitions for much faster power sector decarbonisation. Increases in the already high volumes of interconnection increases the risk that emissions saved through EU power sector decarbonisation will be 'offshored' to the WB.\nEgypt < Cyprus & Greece\n\nSchematic map of proposed interconnection between Libya/ Egypt/Israel and EU member states Greece and Cyprus\nGR\n4\nTR\nAV»\n@ o¢\nCoal plants\n@ Operating\n-----@----.-\n© Planned\nim)\nCapacity (GW)\n® ©\n@ 3\n@ 4\n@>=\ngCO./kWh\nJO\nEY\n600\n400\nEG\n200\nShading indicates average carbon intensity of electricity generation.

The section linking Greece to Egypt is due to be commissioned in 202172.\nEnergy development plans\nUsing 2017 data, we estimate that Egypt had a slightly lower grid intensity than Greece (485 vs 560gCO2/kWh). However, power generation in Egypt is firmly on a fossil trajectory, whereas Greece has already begun decarbonising. In Egypt, Government bans on coal imports and coal power generation were lifted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, and two large coal power plants are currently proposed totalling 10.6GW, with a tender already awarded for the enormous 6.6GW Hamrawein plant. Egypt is also experiencing a natural gas boom. The discovery of the Zohr gas field in the Mediterranean has doubled Egypt's natural gas reserves, and prompted investment in new gas generation. Siemens has been contracted to construct and operate the three biggest CCGT plants in the world (3 x 4.8GW), increasing Egypt's installed capacity by over 40%. These developments vastly outweigh progress on renewable installations, which only made up 7% of installed capacity and 8% of generation in 20187°. The Government has set renewable generation targets of 22% and 42% by 2022 and 2035 respectively. Israel has 4.9GW of operational coal, but has announced this will close before 2025, and is likely to be replaced by gas. Libya has no coal capacity, but still produces carbon intensive electricity owing to its exclusive use of oil and gas.\nIn contrast, power sector emissions in Greece are declining (~40% decline 2007 - 2016, draft NECP), and faster decarbonisation plans have been outlined. These include phasing-out all 4GW of existing coal power by 2028, and a commitment to increase renewable electricity consumption to 61% by 2030. Cyprus currently generates 9% of its electricity from renewables (2017, IEA), but has expressed an ambition to increase this. The 2015 Renewable Energy Roadmap [7] co-produced by the Cypriot Government and IRENA, concluded that between 25-40% is possible by 2030.\nSummary\nThe EuroAfrica and EuroAsia interconnectors will connect the decarbonising grid of Greece, and Cyprus, to new fossil generation in Egypt, coal power in Israel, and gas and oil power plants in Libya. The electricity imported will not pay a carbon price. As Greece phases-out 4GW of coal power by 2028, and Egypt constructs\n22. https://www.euroafrica-interconnector.com/historicagreement/\n23. Egyptian Electricity Holdings Company, Annual Report 2017/18 (p11) http://www.eehc.gov.eg/eehcportal/eng/YearlyReport/finalEnglish.pdf\n28\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\n10.6GW, the 2GW interconnector could facilitate a significant fraction of emissions being offshored rather than saved. While the interconnector will deliver benefits for renewables and system security on both sides, without a border adjustment it will incentivise fossil generation Egypt, Israel, and Libya. It will also slow the transition in Greece and Cyprus by providing a source of cheap, carbon intensive energy. A border carbon adjustment would accelerate the deployment of clean alternatives on both sides of the Mediterranean.\n29\nES\nSI\nSN\nal\nA Border Carbon Adjustme\non electricity\na\nWe propose that a border carbon adjustment is introduced for electricity entering the EUETS region, until the trading partner in question implements an equivalent emissions trading scheme or carbon price of their own.\nHere we explain why this would further the goals of the EU ETS, and discuss some key design features that it is important to get right for the full benefits to be delivered.\nBenefits\nA BCA on electricity would:\nDefend the integrity of EU climate policy by preventing the offshoring of power sector emissions.\ne\nLevel the playing field for all generators operating in the same markets.\nProtect progressive investments of governments and companies. We have shown that some of the highest-ambition EU member states will remain exposed to imports of carbon intensive electricity, just when investment in low carbon alternatives is needed in order to achieve climate goals.\nGenerate revenue for the EU. Revenue that could be used to support environmental projects or monitoring in neighbouring countries (generating political capital), or protect vulnerable customers from any electricity price increases.\nIncentivise carbon pricing in neighbouring countries. Rather than see revenue streams going to the EU, they may wish to redirect to themselves This could instigate a domino effect of carbon pricing in EU neighbours.\n30\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nUnintended consequences\nWhile the benefits are significant, introducing a BCA could result in some unintended consequences, specifically:\ne Resource shuffling. This is a specific type of carbon leakage, where an exporter lowers their obligation by substituting electricity with lower- carbon intensity, while exporting high-carbon electricity with other trade partners. The risk of resource shuffling is highest in markets with large variations in carbon intensity, and a large global scope. While the former is true for electricity production, the latter is not, due to physical constraints on transporting power. There is some evidence for resource shuffling in the Californian ETS (which includes electricity) [8], where some load- serving entities have divested from coal contracts. Another channel for resource shuffling is the direct purchase of low-carbon electricity for import, by mechanisms like power purchase agreements or renewable energy certificates. Energy price increases. Detailed modelling would be needed to assess the effect on electricity bills. Depending on the extent to which importers absorb the additional carbon costs, some may be passed down to end users. The revenues generated by the BCA could be used to mitigate this consequence, as the costs should be met by polluters, not citizens.\nDesign\nA BCA on electricity could take one of two forms: a tariff on imports at the border, or the requirement that importers purchase allowances to cover embodied emissions. The only operational BCA on electricity - under the Californian ETS - takes the latter approach. Under that scheme, “first deliverers” of electricity imports™* are liable to purchase credits to cover the estimated emissions. A separate Sandbag publication compares the two proposed methods, and explores in more detail the issues around BCAs in the EU in general.\nMuch attention has been paid to whether a BCA would comply with international trade law. More specifically, by causing imports to be treated differently, it’s possible a BCA would not comply with the non-discrimination principle of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Article Ill. A recent review [9] offers insights into the likely issues, and highlights how the legal validity would depend on specific design features. It is our view that a BCA on electricity could be designed in a compliant way. In short, this is because the carbon content of imports is measurable, and the EU ETS provides an explicit carbon price at which to charge them.\n24. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17: In the Californian ETS, according to section §95811(b), “first deliverers” of electricity include generating facilities, operators of electricity generating facilities located in California, and electricity importers. According to section §95812(c), importers are liable for “All emissions reported for imported electricity from specified sources of electricity that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year are considered to be above the threshold. All emissions reported for imported electricity from unspecified sources are considered to be above the threshold”.\n31\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nHere we offer some design recommendations, which apply regardless of the specific mechanism adopted (ETS or tariff). These would help deliver the benefits highlighted above, mitigate the unintended consequences, and minimise the risk of legal challenge.\nThree key features:\n1 Accurate calculation of the carbon intensity of imports\nThis is fundamental to setting the level of adjustment, and the choice of method has important legal implications. The carbon intensity of electricity generation varies enormously, from country to country and hour to hour. Consequently, a fair mechanism would measure the carbon intensity of imports in near real-time. This would require intraday (~hourly) data on generation by fuel type, which is available from some but not all neighbouring countries via ENTSO-E and national TSOs.\nStrictly speaking, the most accurate estimate of carbon intensity would be that of the real-time marginal unit in each exporting country. That is because the direction of flow is determined by the differences in wholesale price - flowing from low to high - and the marginal unit generates in the lower price region to satisfy the additional demand created by the interconnector. However, the highly connected nature of the European grid makes the marginal intensity very challenging to calculate in practice, despite recent progress [1].\nIn lieu of hourly generation data, or an estimate or marginal intensity, in this analysis we simply applied an average carbon intensity for each exporting country. In Box 2 we provide a worked example of how a similar approach could be put into practice. Using an average carbon intensity over some period has several benefits. It is simple, reducing the administrative burden; and it is transparent, which could ease political opposition. An average will underestimate the real carbon intensity on systems where the marginal technology is carbon intensive. However, this may be beneficial. GATT Art III.2 states that no taxes “in-excess” of internal taxes should be applied to imports of like products. A conservative estimate of carbon would therefore mitigate against this being breached.\nPerhaps the most difficult aspect of trade law to satisfy in this design is the need to avoid country-specific treatment. The calculation of carbon intensity as we have described it is inherently country specific. However, instead of national averages, estimates could use generation data for a country, combined with international benchmarks for the carbon intensity different technologies. Also, it has been suggested that foreign\n32\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\n33\nproducers should be afforded the ability to document actual emissions, demonstrating where they are lower than an international average. This would also add leverage to the BCA.\nIn ENTSO-E, there is a good basis for providing the detailed generation data needed to estimate the carbon intensity of imports. The provision of such data would need to be part of any legislative proposal. Finally, it is worth noting that these carbon calculations could be applied ex-post, if there was a lag in data availability. Forecasting of the approximate generation mix at the hourly level, and therefore the likely border adjustment rate, is within the capability of most market participants.\nNo rebates for EU generators\nWe do not believe that rebates should be given to EU generators for their carbon costs, as the objective should be that all power generated or consumed in the EU pays a carbon price. A border carbon adjustment would introduce this for imports. Removing the cost for EU exports in the form of a rebate would be a protectionist measure, and could incentivise emissions increases.\nTime-limited and participatory\nThe proposed BCA is meant to adjust for the difference in climate policy cost between EU and non-EU electricity generators, which we have shown is causing carbon leakage by incentivising coal generation over the EU border. It should therefore only remain in place as long as this difference exists. To avoid becoming entrenched, the expiration of the BCA should be prescribed, and only extended if warranted to prevent carbon leakage. Also, the methodology should be transparent and accessible for affected countries, and the border rate should account for equivalent policy costs in those countries. For example, owing to its domestic carbon price, Ukraine would currently receive a small reduction in its border adjustment, increasing in-step with the level of the domestic price.\nTHE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE\nBOX 2\nExample: Turkey in 2018\nBorder tariff\nWe estimate the carbon intensity of the Turkish grid in 2017 was 492tCO2/ GWh. Taking an indicative ETS price for 2018 of €24/tCO2 would give a flat- rate BCA tariff for Turkey in 2018 of €12/MWh (24 [€/tCO2] x 0.492 [tCO2/ MWh]). The same method could be applied to any time period for which an estimate of carbon intensity is available, the shorter the better, to capture real variations in carbon intensity.\nETS allowances\nUsing the above emissions factor, gross imports from Turkey to Greece in 2018 (2.9TWh) emitted 1.4MtCO2. The importer (interconnector) of this electricity would therefore be liable to surrender 1.4m ETS allowances.\n34\nHOW ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM COAL IS LEAKING INTO THE EU\nReferences\n1) Tranberg et al. 2019.

        "feedback": "Observations in anticipation to the impact assessment for a future Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n\nLegal basis\n\nIt is yet not clear whether this mechanism be proposed under a tax regime or in the form of customs duties. Clarity on this matter is necessary as this has a bearing on the legal basis, the delimitation of competences as established in the treaties and the decision making process (unanimity in the case of taxation).  \n\nInternational framework\n\nThe future impact assessment should investigate whether a proposed directive is compliant under the World Trade Organisation framework. Taxation on imported goods (other than customs duties/charges which are bound by WTO GATT) for any specific policy objective, are subject to National Treatment basis – in short, the measure cannot discriminate against foreign products. This seems to be the thinking in the inception impact assessment document. However, this also raises other considerations on how to design / administer such an instrument so as to avoid a burdensome instrument, ensure its efficient enforcement and prevent fraudulent practices by exporters / importers of covered goods.  \n\nEconomic/trade analysis\n\nAccording to the attached NSO data, imports in MT from third countries (including the UK because of BREXIT, but excluding Switzerland and ships and aircraft storage) result to Euro 3.79 billion (grand total 7318.1, less shipment & aircraft 0.2, less EFTA 58.7, less EU 4821.5, plus UK BREXIT 1352.9).  The sectors are found on page 5 of the attached NSO press release.  The Commission is yet to disclose the sectors it intends proposing to be subject to the carbon border adjustment mechanism.  It is important that the impact assessment would investigate whether importation from third countries could be easily substituted at a justifiable cost from importation from within the EU (excluding the UK, post BREXIT).\n\nThe impact assessment does not dwell on whom to attribute the calculation of carbon emissions on each product.  Is it up to the exporter, customs etc to calculate emissions? More details would be required so that an appropriate assessment may be prepared.  \n\nMandatory analysis in conjunction with each Member State\n\nThe impact assessment from the Commission calls for the competitivity of the single market as a whole vis a vis third countries.  Malta reiterates that the single market is comprised of different Member States’ economies, some of which, as in the case of Malta with inherent specificities.  Limited land resources, dependence on imported energy supplies and double insularity, lead to dependence on imports to sustain both economic and social welfare such that the Maltese economy ranks amongst the most open economies in the world. Such particularities give a different character to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the Maltese context since it risks rendering uncompetitive goods and services that are produced in Malta.  \n\nInsofar, a one size fits all carbon border adjustment mechanism, which does not address these inherit particularities, would fall short from creating a harmonised single market, but de facto would allow for severe competitive distortions between Member States.  In other words, there is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals, and would contradict cohesion policy within the Single Market.  \n\nThough upholding the Paris Agreement is noble in its own right, the Commission ought to study whether the proposed mechanism is proportionate to the likely economic disruption of Member States, heavily dependant on importation, and whether the shift from third country imports to EU imports is viable from an economic perspective. Furthermore, the proposal needs also to be studied from a distributional perspective, particularly assessing the impact of higher import prices on more vulnerable groups in society.\n",

The EU should pursue an ambitious implementation of the European Green Deal, including the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and a package of enhanced policies and measures to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. At the international level, the EU should continue cooperating towards an effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments in other countries, thus enhancing the global response to climate change while also reducing the risk of carbon leakage\n•\tThe risk of carbon leakage needs to be addressed with existing and new instruments, aiming in the first place at maximizing global climate protection while safeguarding EU competitiveness. An ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement by all Countries is the most effective way to reduce GHG emissions. While comparable carbon constraints are not in place and an actual risk of carbon leakage exists, the effectiveness of enhancing existing measures should be assessed and compared with possible alternative solutions such as a Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA).  The assessment should include evaluating the impacts both at sector/product level and at EU level, taking especially into account those global technological supply chains most critical to the energy transition, such as renewable energy technologies and batteries\n•\tA CBA should focus only on imports in order to maximize the legal compatibility with international treaties such as WTO and UNCCC.  The design and scope of the CBA should be consistent with non-discriminatory principles of trade treaties and with UNFCCC principles, which foresee more responsibility and efforts by developed Countries compared with developing ones. Applying the CBA only to imports is more likely to be compatible with WTO rules. Its application also to exports, while increasing its overall mitigation impact, makes it more questionable from a trade perspective  \n•\tThe choice and design of the policy instrument should consider its technical, market and political feasibility. Options could include a carbon tax on selected products – both on imported and domestic products, a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports, or the extension of the EU ETS to imports. Extending EU ETS to imports would maximize the overall feasibility of a CBA, simplifying its technical implementation, minimizing market distortions, favoring political adoption at EU level and easing discussions at international level, as the type of instrument and the level of carbon constraints applied to imports would be aligned with the EU domestic approach \n•\tThe possible adoption of a CBA should be considered together with a phase out of free allocation for the same sectors or products in order to be compatible with WTO rules.

Sourcing more than 90 % of electricity supply from renewable hydro energy, Rusal is one of the leading low-carbon aluminium (LCA) producers. \n\nRusal is a largest supplier of PA to EU processors of aluminium — a downstream sector dominated by SMEs — and is concerned that:\n-\toptions for the EU unilateral and sector-specific Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) could undermine competitiveness of its customers in case the CBAM is not fully WTO-compliant;\n-\tCBAM could fail to support the already distressed PA production in the EU and not cope with efficiently reducing the so-called ‘carbon leakage’ caused by energy costs in the EU, i.e. by the EU ETS;\n-\tnone of the discussed CBAM options appears to be in full compliance with the WTO rules, which may lead to severe and time-consuming trade disputes.\nEven a WTO-compatible CBAM does not offer appropriate environmental and trade policy measures for at least those carbon-intensive sectors, which have long moved capacities outside the EU due to the lack of raw materials, high energy and labour costs. The PA sector is a case in point of that. \n\nSince 2000, the EU PA smelting capacity shrunk by ca. 30 %, while the EU consumption of PA grew by approximately the same percentage. Today, the EU meets ca. 75 % of its PA needs through imports, that is expected to continue. \n\nIn this regard, there is little carbon leakage in the EU PA sector, as: \n1) no new smelters were commissioned in the EU for at least 30 years as a result of high costs, primarily in electricity and labour; \n2) reductions in the specific CO2 emissions of the existing EU smelters can only be achieved in external electricity supply, which accounts for 30-40 % of smelters’ costs. \n\nThe inclusion of PA in the scope of CBAM will inevitably drive up the price of imported and domestic PA in the EU. For downstream companies who employ more than 90 % of the industry’s workforce the cost of PA can constitutes 40 to 80 % of the total. Any unilateral increase of those costs may trigger further “drain” of production from the EU. \nIn order to deliver on the European Green Deal and to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2050, CBAM should employ tailored approach to such essential products as PA. \n\nThe European Commission (EC) may wish to consider permanent unilateral import tariff suspension vis-à-vis products with low carbon content, such as LCA. Rusal has been proactive in industry-wide efforts to define LCA benchmark reflecting average performance and would be pleased to share the available knowledge.\n\nThe tariff exemptions for LCA are achievable through a separate CN code and a reliable system of CO2 footprint certification. Such approach could apply only to selected products that are currently subject to substantial WTO-bound import tariffs of >2 % in the EU. It would be fully compliant with the WTO rules, would support the EU in its climate agenda and level playing field for the EU downstream.\n\nAdditionally, CBAM could encourage industry-wide incentives for research collaboration for decarbonization and sustainability. This could cover inert anode and other breakthrough technologies for emissions/cost reductions, x-ray/sensor-based/laser detection technologies for recycling, among others.\n\nRusal welcomes the guidelines on CBAM and a fair, transparent, and inclusive process and would be pleased to share its expertise on the optimal ways of making the EU CBAM truly viable for the low-carbon future, and  ready for swift implementation.\n",

We believe the EU ETS, with its cost compensation, is the most cost- effective policy measure to achieve greenhouse gas reductions in the EU while avoiding carbon leakage. The Commission then states that the “starting point of the exercise will be the new baseline scenario of the EU Green Deal and its higher ambition for 2030”. IFIEC believes that an increase of the EU’s climate policy ambition should in parallel be accompanied with an enhanced set of policy measures that provide the European industry with an effective carbon leakage protection.\n1.1 Type of policy instrument\nThe Commission states in the IIA that it will carefully assess the legal and technical feasibility of different policy options and their compatibility with the EU’s trade acquis and other international commitments of the EU as well as the EU’s Emission Trading System (EU ETS) and existing policy measures that aim at reducing the risk carbon leakage. Three policy measures are listed in the IIA as possible options for the implementation of a CBAM: 1) a carbon tax on selected products, 2) a carbon customs duty or tax on imports, 3) an extension of the EU ETS on imports. In relation to this, the Commission has stated in its Communication “A New Industrial Strategy for Europe”: “Should differences in ambition around the world persist, the Commission will propose a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in 2021 to reduce the risk of carbon leakage, in full compatibility with WTO rules. This should be supported by strengthening current tools to tackle carbon leakage. m1 our\nWe welcome the approach of the Commission to strengthen the EU’s current tools to prevent carbon leakage. Further developing and strengthening the existing policy mix is essential to provide an effective carbon leakage protection. A CBAM must be considered as an additional complementary possible option. In the assessment, the Commission should also assess the way to improve existing policy measures, as these policy measures have proven to be somewhat effective’ in the past to prevent carbon leakage and would only need to be partially adapted to provide better protection.\nIFIEC Europe agrees with the Commissions statement in the IIA that a careful assessment of the legal and technical feasibility of a CBAM should be carried out. Assessing the impacts of a CBAM in general and the impacts of its different policy design options on the EU ETS as well as its compliance with international treaties and law is highly important. IFIEC Europe notes that some further aspects should be taken into account: the assessment should also encompass aspects related to the political feasibility, including options for the implementation of a global monitoring system in collaboration with third countries.\n1\nEuropean Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, A New Industrial Strategy for Europe, COM(2020) 102 final, p. 8.\n2\nCarbon and investment leakage have occurred in some sectors, despite the introduction of measures for carbon leakage protection. In the European non-ferrous sector 10 out of 35 primary aluminum smelters that were based inside the EU have closed. Investments have been redirected to third countries and the production has subsequently been replaced by CO2 intensive imports from these countries.\n2\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nRif <C europ c\nntemati nal feder\nstrial energy consul\n1.2 Methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products\nThe Commission considers benchmarks as an approach to implement a CBAM and states: “To the extent that a sector is covered by the EU ETS, a border measure could be based on similar methodological considerations as for the ETS, i.e. benchmark values [...]”. IFIEC Europe notes that an approach that relies on carbon intensity could result in high administrative costs (see section 2.3 below). Moreover, not all production processes of a sector participate in the EU ETS. Implementing a CBAM with benchmark values would therefore either require that a) the CBAM and its benchmarks applies to all importers as well as non-ETS producers? or b) that the CBAM and its benchmarks applies only to imports that are manufactured in facilities with characteristics similar to those listed in Annex | of the EU ETS directive.\n[e) Option a): including non-ETS installations in the CBAM would result in double pricing, as various EU member states have introduced carbon pricing mechanisms at the national level in form of carbon taxes as well as national trading schemes. The CBAM would in this case increase the risk of carbon leakage substantially, unless the national carbon pricing policies are removed. [e) Option b): including only installations from third countries in the CBAM that match the characteristics of Annex | of the EU ETS directive would require the collaboration with third countries and independent verifiers. Proofing and monitoring that a product was indeed manufactured in an ETS-like installation would be necessary to avoid that products are falsely declared as being manufactured in non-ETS-like installations to circumvent the CBAM.\nThe Commission has stated that it will assess alternative approaches such as defining the carbon content of products. We agree that alternative methodological approaches should be analysed. A system for disclosing the carbon content of a product has not been developed so far. The data that would be required for this approach would at least include the information about the content of the product, the carbon footprint of each of the production processes involved in the production of each component (direct and indirect emissions)*. To take the whole value chain intro account, the Commission should also consider the emissions related to the transportation of imported products. Also, this approach would require the cooperation of third countries and independent verifies.\n1.3 Sectoral scope\nIn relation to the sectors that could be covered by a CBAM, the Commission states in its IIA that “[a]n important part of the work will also relate to the selection of sectors subject to this measure. A scoping in terms of sectors concerned will have to be defined to ensure that the measure applies where the risk of carbon leakage is the highest”. We believe that sectors at risk of carbon leakage should all be equally well protected and argue that this should not automatically result in the introduction of a CBAM. Rather, a policy measure should fit the needs of the industry. The legislator should duly take\n3 Excluding non-ETS installations would most likely result In WTO complaints from third countries.\n4\nExisting norms allow for different modes of emission allocation for processes producing several products in combination, e.g. either by value or by mass. This leads to results which can differ by a factor of 10.\n3\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nRif <C europ c\nntemati nal feder\nstrial energy consul\nthe characteristics of the industry into account, such as the complexity of its value chains, and then decide whether a CBAM or another policy measure is more appropriate as a complementary measure.\n2 Preliminary assessment of expected impacts\nThe Commission noted in its IIA that the impacts of a CBAM on the economic, social, environmental and administrative dimension would need to be assessed. We agree that the impacts a CBAM would have on these dimensions should be assessed carefully.\n2.1 The economic dimension\nWith regard to the economic dimension, the Commission specifically aims at assessing the impact on industrial value chains and effects on downstream and upstream sectors as well as economic efficiency of the policy measure. IFIEC believes that this is necessary, especially in case the CBAM would not be applied to finished goods due to the complexity of the model but more to upstream goods or activities: implementing a CBAM at the EU border would increase the prices of upstream goods that are imported and subsequently processed in installations within the EU. It will be important for the impact assessment to calculate the estimated increased costs of the CBAM throughout the value chain, and whether this in turn would result in an increased import of finished goods in Europe.\nThe Commission also aims at analysing the effects a CBAM would have on third countries and their markets. We believe that such an assessment is relevant. The analysis should be conducted in a transparent way and should closely involve all the stakeholders concerned. IFIEC believes that a structured dialogue and cooperation between the Commission and the industry- and energy sector must be established in addition to the envisaged public consultation, to thoroughly discuss and investigate the regulatory and trade related framework needed to prevent carbon leakage and to successfully master the transition to a low carbon economy.\nThe Commission states in the IIA that it expects positive impacts of a CBAM on research and innovation as well as the development of low-carbon products. IFIEC Europe believes that such an effect will only be realised, if certain additional conditions are met. The development of breakthrough technologies for the production of low-carbon products will require additional financial support, which must not be limited to technology innovation support, but also cover new applications and scale ups. To bridge the so-called ‘valley of death’, market barriers for low-carbon innovations must be removed.\nIf the EU would increase its climate targets for 2030 to 50 % to 55 % and would introduce a CBAM whilst other third countries would not raise their ambitions related to climate protection, export- oriented sectors would face the issue that their existing products become more and more uncompetitive at the world market, due to a rising EU ETS price and low or no carbon prices abroad, whilst low carbon products are not competitive on the world market either, due to the fact that in most cases the investment and operational costs of low carbon processes are much higher compared to existing production processes. Therefore, indirect cost compensation and free allocation should be maintained and improved and a rebate for exported goods for carbon avoidance costs should be foreseen to protect export-oriented production from the risk of carbon leakage. If a cross sectoral\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\n4\nKRifie\nntemati nal federatic strial energy consur\ncorrection factor is applied, the rebate should also apply to exports of current products, while taking into account which carbon leakage protection measures exist per sector.\nIf a CBAM is introduced the revenues should be primarily used to support exports. The remainder of the revenues should be used to reduce electricity cost of small and large-scale consumers. Reducing electricity prices is key for the success of the Green Deal, as most low-carbon production processes will either be using electricity directly or indirectly (e.g. via hydrogen and synthetic fuels produced form electricity). Other parts of the revenues should be used to facilitate research and development of low- carbon technologies as well as their market uptake and further improvement (e.g. energy and resource efficiency). We believe that a CBAM will not suffice to create a low-carbon economy and that the European industry further needs support of the European Commission and EU Member States.\n2.2 The social dimension\nThe Commission points out that a CBAM could lead to price increases of consumer products, including products for basic needs. IFIEC requests an in-depth reflection on carbon pricing policies that focus on a carbon signal in production and consumption. The Commission should consider to mitigate these impacts by reducing other cost that consumers must bear. As stated above reducing electricity cost of industrial consumers can help to facilitate the market uptake of low carbon technologies. Reducing electricity cost can also help to make manufacturing less expensive, which in turn could mitigate price increases of consumer products.\n2.3. The administrative dimension\nThe Commission states in the IIA that the introduction of a CBAM may require traders and authorities “to determine the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of an imported product” and that “[aJncillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries may be needed”. There is currently no system in place neither in the EU nor at global level to determine and compare the carbon footprint of domestic and foreign products and/or producers. A robust monitoring, reporting and verification system will need to be established, ensuring legal certainty and equal treatment of international competitors.\nFrom our point of view, determining the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of an imported product is a must or in other words an essential precondition for the functioning of a CBAM. Without the proper knowledge about the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a production process a CBAM is prone to fail, as companies from third countries could otherwise claim that their products are carbon neutral and generate windfall profits.\nThe Commission has noted in its IIA that the administrative burden should be minimized and proposed to this end to use greenhouse gas emission benchmarks for imports from third countries. If a company certifies “a lower carbon content and/or a higher carbon cost at origin” for its product, the CO» cost related to the product would be adjusted. This approach would limit the need to assess the production process of companies in third countries to cases where companies prove that the carbon content of their product is below the benchmark. Ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries would still have to be conducted ona regular basis to verify the actual emissions related to a product. Therefore, verifications should be conduction by an independent international\n5\nIFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nKifiec europ c\ninternational federation of strial energy consul\norganisation. If the Commission considers to use a benchmark-based approach, the CBAM should apply a uniform benchmark. Differentiating between different third countries, country groups or regions could encourage exploitation. Products from one country with a relatively high benchmark could be transported other countries with lower benchmarks and exported from there into the EU.\n3 Conclusion\nIn addition to the existing carbon leakage policy measures, additional protection is required. Therefore, IFIEC welcomes that the Commission will conduct an impact assessment. We suggest that this in-depth reflection should be extended to carbon pricing policies in general and on all possible policy options that would help mitigate carbon and investment leakage for exposed industries with regard to import and export. We would like discuss our arguments and ideas for a future EU energy and climate policy with the Commission in more detail, to further contribute to the successful implementation of the European Green Deal.\nAbout IFIEC Europe\nIFIEC Europe represents 13 national European associations that comprise - on a cross-sectoral level - those industrial sectors for which energy is a significant component of production costs.

Independently from the future impact of this crisis which cannot yet be anticipated, the impact assessment by the Commission of the proposed Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) mechanism should primarily try to understand if, when and how can CBAs strengthen existing carbon leakage measures. The impact assessment should also assess how the mechanism can preserve the competitiveness of EU products on export markets. The impact assessment should also address the fact that for sectors with similar characteristics as in the ceramic industry, CBAs do not appear to be neither feasible nor efficient in strengthening carbon leakage measures. Consequently, it will be even more important for these sectors to maintain the existing system of free allocations for best performers, potentially combined with other complementary policy instruments.\nIn particular: \nCarbon Border Adjustments should be designed to strengthen carbon leakage protection in the long term\nDepending on the outcome of the ongoing decision making process on ETS benchmark updates and on the fluctuations of the carbon price (from 30€ to 50 €/tCO2), the European ceramic industry anticipates an ETS cost under Phase IV ranging from € 1 Billion to € 3 Billion, assuming that carbon leakage measures and the 2030 targets for the ETS sector remain unchanged.  In the absence of any carbon leakage measure, the cost for the sector would range from € 3.8 Billion to € 6.3 Billion.  Over the last years the European ceramic industry has done great investments to maintain its competitiveness in a globalised economy and reduce the carbon content of its products.  Any decrease of the carbon leakage protection foreseen until 2030 would significantly jeopardise the ability of the sector to further invest in new and breakthrough technologies or to develop key technologies further to bring them to the market (marketability). \n\nPolicies merely increasing carbon costs on EU manufacturing without duly considering the carbon leakage risk will reduce EU carbon emissions from manufacturing as a result of relocation but will increase the EU’s consumed carbon due to imports from countries with lower or non-existing carbon costs on manufacturing.  That is why the main objective of CBAs should be to strengthen existing carbon leakage measures.  \n\n",

Rather, it should be a tool to differentiate on carbon content of products, and it is essential that it would be correctly designed to avoid negative consequences for the aluminium value chain.\nLegal unit: Hydro Energi AS P.O.Box 980 Skayen NO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address: Drammensveien 264 Oslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n1/8\nIn this response, we will explain 1) why a global level playing field is essential for industry and 2) why CBAM is not a carbon leakage measure for aluminium. In the Annex we describe how a CBAM needs be designed to benefit aluminium industry positively.\n1\nA global level playing field between industrial producers is essential to maintain the competitiveness of the European industry\nClimate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and reducing CO2-emission to limit global warming to 1,5 degrees will require substantial efforts across all sectors.\nA global CO2-cost would be the best way to achieve global CO2-emission reduction whilst ensuring a global level playing field for all industries. However, this is unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future. We fully support the EU European Emission Trading system (EU ETS), which aluminium is part of. To reduce the risk of carbon leakage, the EU has introduced carbon leakage measures to mitigate the actual risk of industrial closure and production decrease, namely free allocation for direct emissions and possibilities for Member States to compensate for CO2 costs in the power price, via State Aid policy.\nGiven our electro-intensive nature, aluminium is particularly exposed to risk of carbon leakage because of the indirect CO2 emissions costs (i.e. the CO2-price element passed on in power prices). Even Hydro, which is mainly based on non-emitting power sourcing has a substantial exposure to EU ETS cost through the carbon price incorporated in the power price, which is delinked from the electricity generation’s greenhouse gas footprint.\nIn addition, Hydro is also exposed to carbon leakage risk due to our direct emissions. To shield the aluminium industry a carbon exposed sector, fee allocation, up to calculated benchmark levels, serves as an instrument to reduce the risk of carbon leakage.\nWe are of the opinion that the existing measures are the most adequate carbon leakage protection measures for aluminium production in Europe, as they shield European producers from high carbon cost exposure which other global producers do not face, and thus ensuring a better level playing field between European and other producers.\n2\nCarbon border measure is not an adequate alternative carbon leakage measure for aluminium\nThe IIA specifies that CBAM is to be an alternative to existing carbon leakage measures, namely free allowances and indirect CO2 costs compensation.\ne The assumption that CBAM can be a carbon leakage measure in general must rest on the assumption that the tax will increase the price level on European products, and thus represent an opportunity for European producers to pass CO2-cost onto the product prices - an opportunity that does not exist today for aluminium. For CBAM to truly be a carbon leakage measure, the price effect should be 1-1 with the tax level. But whether such a price effect will be realized, will differ from market to market and product to product. Therefore, introduction of CBAM does not automatically imply increased carbon leakage protection, neither for indirect emission costs nor for direct emissions. The carbon leakage protection will depend on the degree of price effect from the CBAM, which again depends on the market and marginal importers of each product along the value chain. Furthermore, for a CBAM system to work, it would need to cover the whole value chain, upstream and downstream. If this would not be the case, customers buying primary aluminium might have an incentive to move downstream production out of Europe to avoid the effects of\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n2/8\nLegal unit: Hydro Energi AS P.O.Box 980 Skayen NO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nthe tax. Then the effect of CBAM would be lower primary aluminium demand in Europe and moving out of downstream production, and thus CBAM would have clear negative consequences.\n2.1 For aluminium, a CBAM based on carbon content of imports cannot be a sufficient measure for carbon leakage protection for the following reasons:\nIndirect CO2 costs - The biggest carbon leakage risk for European electro-intensive industry is indirect CO2 costs (the CO2-price element in power prices), see figure 2. Globally, it is only the European aluminium industry that faces such indirect CO2-costs. For primary aluminium, the indirect costs are 6-7 times larger than the direct costs. Electricity market price setting - Indirect CO2-costs depend on the specific price setting mechanism in the European electricity market and do not result from the physical fuel mix nor from its carbon content. For instance, Norway has almost 100% renewable electricity production, but still has a ‘price effect’ of the CO2-price on electricity price by 0,67' on all the electricity that industries consume. In other words, indirect CO2-costs are not correlated with indirect CO2- emissions. Indirect emissions vs indirect costs -Therefore, setting a CBAM on indirect emissions will not mitigate the carbon leakage risk linked to indirect CO2-costs for European aluminium producers. Hence, if a CBAM should be introduced for aluminium, it is essential that CO2- compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. CBAM vs CO2 compensation - The difference between CBAM and CO2-compensation can be illustrated as follows: [e) On average, there is a high carbon footprint in aluminium imported to the EU, anda CBAM means there will be a CO2 cost levied on imports. The potential price effects from the CBAM will however be based on the marginal importer. It is not unlikely that for primary aluminium, this will be Middle East producers. This production has a carbon footprint from indirect emissions that are higher than the European emissions, see figure 3. If a border mechanism carbon cost is calculated based on the emission level above the European average, this will mean a CO2-cost on imports from the Middle East. This cost level and potential price effect will however be far below the carbon leakage protection in CO2-compensation, see figure 4. If CO2-compensation, given at 75% aid intensity in the illustration, is replaced with CBAM in this case, this will mean that carbon leakage protection for European aluminium industry is wiped out, see figure 5.\n1 Cf IV of the 2012 Guidelines certain State aid in the context of the greenhouse emission annex on measures gas allowances trading scheme post-2012 for the CO2 emissions factors in the different geographical areas (tCO2/MWh): https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012XC0605(01)&from=EN\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n3/8\nFigure 2: Comparison of direct and indirect CO2-costs for different industries Source: Ecofys (2015)\nPrimary aluminum\nRefined copper\nSlab zinc\nproduction\nproduction\nproduction*\n16%\n@\n84%\n*Assuming all RLE is\nhydrometallurgical\nFerro-silicon and silicon\nmetal production\n77%\n77%\n0\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\nm Direct emissions costs = Indirect emissions costs\n(ex. process emissions)\nPulp & paper\nChemicals\nCeramics\n21%\nV\n79%\nii\nIndirect emissions ME\n6\n?

EU industries have relatively low carbon footprint compared to international competitors due to the low-carbon electricity production in Europe versus other countries, especially China with its high degree of coal fired power production, see figure 1. There is, however, no competitive advantage versus other regions with higher CO2-emissions in production. Today EU’s imported volumes of industrial products have a higher carbon footprint and at the same time most of the imported goods are produced in countries or regions with either no CO2-costs or a very low carbon cost compared to Europe.\nFigure 1: CO2-footprint in primary aluminium, Hydro and European average vs global average\nCoal\nCO2-emissions tonne aluminium\nper\n20,0\n18,0\n16,0\n* Small differences in direct\nemissions Global production has considerably larger CO2- emissions from indirect than European industry\n14,0\n12,0\nGas\n10,0\n8,0\n6,0\nRenewables\nNone outside Europe face any\n40\ncosts related to carbon content\n“ERR\naeeidalenun\nin power prices\né o e & a Ra & S\ns KS XP\n3G Ry Ro &\ng\nR\ne G\nKe)\nse\ns\nK\nRS)\n&f\n4\n‘y\nf Ra\n¢\n= Direct emissions Indirect emissions\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\n6/8\nVisiting address: Drammensveien 264 Oslo, Norway\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\nHow should a CBAM be designed to fit aluminium\n2\nAs explained in the previous paragraph, we are of the opinion that a carbon border measure is not an adequate carbon leakage mitigation measure for aluminium. If a CBAM should be introduced, it cannot replace current carbon leakage measures. It could be an additional tool to create a competitive advantage for low-carbon producers. In addition, if such a measure is to be introduced and be effective for aluminium, it needs to be carefully designed to avoid unintended effects with negative implications for industrial competitiveness. If not appropriately designed, such a measure could undermine rather than support the European aluminium industry.\nA model for an adequate carbon border tax adjustment-system for the aluminium sector should include the following criteria:\nA CBAM system should be designed to create a competitive advantage for low-carbon products and producers The purpose of a CBAM should be to add CO2-costs to high carbon imported products. This could create a competitive advantage for European producers with lower carbon footprint and give incentives to other producers to reduce their footprint to access the European market. Adding CO2-costs to imports does not automatically constitute a carbon leakage protection for European industry, and CBAM should therefore not be considered a carbon leakage measure. Current carbon leakage measures need to be preserved Both free allowances and indirect CO2-compensation must be continued alongside a CBAM-system. There is no certainty that a tax imposed on products will result in carbon leakage protection — that will depend on to what extent the tax allows European producers to pass on the CO2-costs into product prices. In addition: 1) EU Free allowances: If products in CBAM should be taxed for emissions above ETS-benchmark level, we would still nevertheless need free allowances to achieve a level playing field globally. Taking away free allocation up to the benchmark would lead to an additional carbon exposure for European industries that the importer will not face, 2) Indirect CO2-costs for European industry are not correlated with indirect CO2- emissions. Therefore, setting a CBAM on indirect emissions will not mitigate the carbon leakage risk linked to indirect CO2-costs. Hence, it is essential that CO2-compensation is kept alongside a CBAM. Asa CBAM does not imply carbon leakage protection for aluminium, keeping existing CO2- compensation would not create double compensation. A CBAM system needs to cover both direct and indirect emissions What differentiates carbon footprint of aluminium production globally is the indirect emissions (linked to the electricity consumption) in primary aluminium production. Hence, a system focusing only on direct emissions would not have the intended effect. A CBAM system needs to cover the whole value chain, upstream and downstream A CBAM system would work effectively if the system encompassed products from primary metal down to the final product. If this is not the case, customers buying aluminium might have an incentive to move downstream production out of Europe to avoid the effects of the tax. A CBAM system should focus on including emissions of the primary production The electrolysis process is where there are large differences in CO2-emissions in aluminium production globally, due to differences in indirect emissions. Other parts of the value chain have much less variation in emissions. The main focus should therefore be to include the carbon footprint of the primary metal embedded in all aluminium products throughout the downstream value chain.\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address:\nDrammensveien 264\nOslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n718\nSystem requirements necessary to facilitate CBAM:\ne We need a legitimate system for disclosing carbon content of each product Today, there is no common system for disclosing the carbon content of imported products.

Introduction of CBAM could trigger WTO complaints against the EU by third countries and also some retaliatory trade measures.\nAll these criteria need to be fulfilled for a CBAM system to have a global climate effect and protect competitiveness of European industry.\nLegal unit:\nHydro Energi AS\nP.O.Box 980 Skayen\nNO — 0240 Oslo, Norway\nVisiting address: Drammensveien 264 Oslo, Norway\nwww.hydro.com\nT +47 22 53 81 00\nEmail: hydro.energi@hydro.com\nRegistration No.\nNO 930 187 240 MVA\n8/8"

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nHigh EU standards can have the de facto effect of exporting those standards to companies wishing to sell into the EU market. This is most clearly seen, for example, in the health and safety of imported foods or chemicals complying with REACH. This de facto effect is not incompatible with trade law.\n4.

An ‘as such’ review examines whether the national law itself is compatible with WTO law.

The Architecture of a border measure must address the EU’s climate objective\n[W]e consider that a measure’s purposes, objectively manifested in the design, architecture and structure of the measure, are intensely pertinent to the task of evaluating whether or not that measure is applied so as to afford protection to domestic production.\nAB Chile-Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages, December 1999\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator and the second highest indirect emissions intensity among the 8 eligible sectors.\nThe European Steel Association\n1920\nIndirect emission\nTrade\nleakage indicator\nintensity\n(GOS instead of GVA)\nintensity\n[kg CO2 / EUR GOS]\nINAcE | 203-2015 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015\n1411 |Manufacture ofleatherclothes|__—_—3,029_— | 83,00% | 3,650\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\nefined petroleum products\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nSimilarly, the section 3.1.1 on aid intensity and degressivity of the consultants’ study assesses the impact of indirect costs (with a carbon price of 25€/t) after 75% compensation taking into account the GVA. In such assessment, among the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has around the fourth indirect costs impact (after 75% compensation), which is comparable to the sectors with the lower impact (blue bars below). Yet, if labour costs are excluded from the denominator (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector have very clearly the second highest impact (orange bars below), with a large difference above the remaining sectors.\nIndirect CO2 costs after 75% compensation\n5,4%\n5,0%\n4,3%\n4,0%\n2,9%\n3,0%\n2,3%\n2,1%\n2,0%\n1,9\n1,8%\n:\n1,39\n1,3%\n1,6%\n0 99\n0,99\n0,89\n0,9\n1,0%\n0,7\n0,69\n0,0%\n&\nxe)\nny\nCo\nSS\nov\n<2\nNo\nSS\nx2\n¥\ns\nNS\nRS\n<O\nSs\n<O\ngf\n&\ney\nS\nR\nNs\nSy\nBS\nAS\nNe’\nSS\n6\nRo\ny\nRNa\n»\nwv?\n&\nae\n&\ns”?\n<8\nSs\nKO\n‘Sy\ne\nPS\nwv?\n&\n<O\noe\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GVA\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GOS\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nThe above analysis is even more relevant if one considers the profitability of the eligible sectors.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

Following the opening of its first milling plant Aliénor Ciments in Tonneins, South West of France in July 2018, Cem’In’Eu foresees the setting-up of 4 new sites in France and 2 in Europe.\nCem’In’Eu built a completely new and fully optimised business model to reduce the environmental impact of each activity along the entire value chain (see the concrete example at the end of the document). Carbone4 (http://www.carbone4.com/) calculated the carbon footprint of our company and of our products. In one year, we decrease our carbon footprint by 25% thanks to the optimisation of all levers (Clinker selection, logistics, cement recipes and packaging).\n=\nWe are convinced that the new carbon border adjustment mechanism would be a powerful tool to thrive for greener products.\nCem’In’Eu’s contribution\nTo contribute to the in-depth analysis Cem’In’Eu presents the following elements for consideration:\n] The EU should continue to work with global partners in applying ambitious carbon pricing, that will drive changes. It is thus crucial to ensure that the future mechanism will comply with World Trade Organisation rules. This requires a thorough analysis of the legal and practical feasibility of introducing such a mechanism. Importers and European actors must be treated equally in order to avoid any distortion of competition or unfair protection for old and polluting European cement industries. This mechanism is particularly relevant for the construction sector with the renovation wave announced by the Green Deal. Indeed, cement is the essential binder for the manufacture of concrete, which is involved in more than 80% of constructions. All initiatives must be carried out in a comprehensive approach to foster innovation and move from a status quo that was misused by cement industries for years. The EU should set the carbon border adjustment mechanism in a way that will incentivise investments made fo innovate for low carbon solutions. The carbon Border Adjustment mechanism would prevent innovation if it acts like a protective tax. A new carbon customs duty or tax on imports will not give the right signal to the industry. This is a matter of efficiency, as such a design will not incentivize old European cement industries to invest in low carbon solutions. Cem’In’Eu fully supports the idea of the extension of the EU ETS to imports with measures to safeguard the level playing field. New entrants, even from outside Europe, in the cement industry have the power to foster innovations and transform traditional industries. The carbon border adjustment mechanism should avoid complexity in design and administration. It should not be misused as a protectionist barrier that will benefit to less innovative or more polluting factories. Cem'In’Eu sees this mechanism as a way to massively scale up the cement industry’s contributions to the carbon neutral transition, by incentivizing the most efficient ways to lower emissions thanks to: a innovation that improves the energy performance of installations b a complete shake up of the supply chain taking into account the whole industrial process (upstream and downstream) To be efficient and fair, the tax must apply the same CO2 benchmark per ton of clincker as that in force for ETS 4. Moreover, new entrants, even importers should benefit from free ETS quotas based on the benchmark, for a fair measure. The previous EU ETS system until phase 4, created perverse effects that biased the system. Indeed, it did not generate a dynamic carbon price. In the definition of carbon content of products, the European Commission must integrate the full supply chain, not just the final product.\nCem’In’Eu is convinced that the carbon border adjustment mechanism is the right tool to foster innovation in the cement industry. It could create a momentum for a behavioural change if well coordinated with the EU ETS. The carbon adjustment mechanism, as a structural measure, must be built on the right design to be a cornerstone of the European Green Deal.\nWhat can be done to reduce now CO2 emissions?\nCem’In’Eu developed a new conception of the cement industry to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the product. We act on different elements to leverage our action:\nClinker selection: Our clinker producer operates with a new plant from 2015 whereas the last kiln built in France for example was in 1978. On average only 51% of the European producer used the most advanced technologies being dry process with preaheater and precalciner (https: ccassociation.or nr/). We know that modern plants use up to 40% less fuels than old “wet” process (https: ccassociation.or nr/). We also choose our clinker producer for logistics reason. The plant is based on a port, this avoids additional upstream logistics CO? emissions.\ne\nSupply Chain optimisation: We import our clinker by big vessels from Turkey to the port of Séte. The plant is located on the main Toulouse-Bordeaux railway line with existing branches leading to vacant sidings, one of which is exclusively for use by Aliénor Ciments. Clinker arrives at the site by train from Séte. To support its clinker logistics, Cem’In’Eu built a 60,000t clinker storage yard at the port of Séte, Cem’In’Log, allowing clinker to be transported directly to the plant by rail, the most efficient means of transport in terms of CO? per t/km.\nWe use a unique process, a bespoke container-based transport system, thus the clinker can be moved without any dust. Upon arrival each container is lifted individually by an automated overhead crane and loaded into the discharging position at an angle over the discharge bin, enabling a full train of 26 cars, loaded with 52 containers of 32 t of clinker each, allowing 1.680 t to be unloaded and reloaded in less than five hours. Every single journey of this train, with almost no CO? per t/km, avoids 60 truck on the road and the huge CO? emissions linked.\nv\nBy stopping the use of trucks to transport clinker from the port to plant, we reduced our CO? emissions by -10 kg of CO2/tonne of equivalent cement (calculation based on the Carbone 4 audit method)\nv\nThanks to an optimized supply chain, our upstream logistics emissions are equivalent to our downstream logistics emissions. The vessels emissions between Turkey and Séte and the rail between Séte and Tonneins, produce the same level of emissions (about 28kg of Co2) as the deliveries by trucks to our customers in our catchment areas of 200kms.\nPlant optimisation: Aliénor Ciments is a 0.24Mta cement grinding plant located in Tonneins. Its modular design enables it to be constructed quickly, efficiently and environmentally friendly. The mill uses around 105t of Vega grinding balls to grind the clinker. To reduce the nuisance of the grinding process, the mill building is covered in a special cladding to lower noise pollution by 32dB to 82dB when the mill is in operation. In terms of emissions control, air compressors are used to move material and any dust is contained. The plant is equipped with a Scheuch baghouse with 6.5m-long bags for dust capture. There is also a stack which only emits waste air from the process and dust is kept below 20mg/Nm3.\nVv\nThe plant — using Carbone 4 methodology with fixed assets & immobilization, energy consumption, company cars & vehicles, staff travel - produces only 5kg of CO2/tonne of equivalent cement\nCement recipes: As a cement producer we can change blends and reduce the proportion of clinker used.\n¥  Cem’in’Eu reduces the clinker factor and we reduce by -15kg of CO2/tonne of equivalent cement\nContact Cem'In’Eu Vincent Lefebvre, Président 1-2 allée Baco, 44300 Nantes - France v.lefebvre@cemineu.com\nWe are on the EU transparency register under to number: 50691 2037725-23\nFind out more at: www.cemineu.com"

        "pdf_text": "page 1 of 4\nBrussels, Wednesday, 01 April 2020\nCEFS FEEDBACK ON THE CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM ROADMAP\nProducing roughly eighteen million tonnes of sugar across nineteen Member States', CEFS (Comité Européen des Fabricants de Sucre) brings together practically all sugar-producing companies making their European Association (www.cefs.org) highly representative of the sector and a reference at EU and international level for its technical expertise.\nCEFS welcomes the possibility to provide feedback on the inception impact assessment on the carbon border adjustment mechanism, although recommendations after the finalised impact assessment are also crucial for developing well-balanced policy options. We share the ambition of the initiative, stressing that as long as many international partners do not share the same Climate ambitions as the EU, there Is a risk of carbon leakage; meaning that there is a risk of production being transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emissions reduction, or that EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.\nThere is a choice here: securing the sugar supply of EU citizens either by a highly efficient, sustainable domestic industry or through external sources on which the regulatory framework of the EU has a very limited impact.\nSugar Sector\nThe EU sugar sector - in contrast to all of its global competitors - is now operating in a very liberalised market environment, becoming increasingly open to competition, due to the end of the production quotas on 30 September 2017. The EU is already granting preferential, tariff-free ac- cess for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACPs). The entry into force of a large number of new Free Trade Agreements entails enhanced compe- tition for EU manufacturers, and puts EU sugar manufacturers in an awkward competitive situa- tion, as sugar in third countries is often produced on the basis of lower social and environmental standards. In contrast, at global level, the EU sugar industry must trade on an uneven level playing field, at global level, with the major sugar-producing players receiving increasing trade-distorting public support and protection.\nIn the conditions described above, and because sugar is an international commodity, the EU market is inevitably affected by a world market price which does not represent real production costs.\n12018/19 Marketing Year Figures for EU-28; this sugar is produced from approximately 110 million tonnes or sugar beet.\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium\n& +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope\npage 2 of 4\nEU sustainable sugar production should not be undermined and replaced by cheap, unfair or illegal sugar imports sometimes travelling long distances.\nSugar manufacturing in the EU is currently subject to the highest standards and requirements of the world, when it comes to environmental protection, agricultural production and workers safety for instance.\nAmongst others, sugar manufacturing is regulated under the EU ETS (eg. heat and electricity production in high-efficient CHP generation, drying processes, lime production for purification of raw juice). Because of its high trade intensity (19,7 %) and its COz relevance, it is a sector part of the Carbon Leakage List.\nCEFS would therefore like to stress that, in any case, protection against carbon leakage needs to be ensured for the European sugar manufacturing sector,\nRecommendations\nThe proposed system of carbon border adjustment mechanism nevertheless brings questions:\n1 Scope of such mechanism: a Will tt encompass all sectors that are part of the Carbon Leakage List? If not, how will the selection be made? Will this system only take into account transformation, or additional parts of the value chain and environmental impacts? Could this policy option work well only on the import side (export reimbursement is not part of the present Commission's concept and would not be in accordance with WTO requirements)? If so, how to preserve the competitiveness of our exports? 2. Will the huge amount of necessary regulation be feasible? 3, What use will be made out of the revenues from this mechanism?\n1. Scope of the mechanism\na. The proposed system seems rather straightforward to set up for materials such as steel or cement (sectors eligible for state aid for indirect carbon costs compensation). However, when it comes to food products, and especially sugar, the system leaves room for interpretation. In case only transformation is counted, the impact of primary, raw materials and other co-products in the value chain (such as feed, fertilizers etc.) will not be collected and can lead to miscalculations, An alternative compensation system should then be put in place in this case.\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium\n& +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope\npage 3 of 4\nIt is moreover unclear whether such system will complement or replace the ETS rules. In order to guarantee a fair protection of the EU sugar manufacturing activities, CEFS advocates for the car- bon border mechanism to be used in additionto the ETS rules, and not instead of the ETS system.\nb, In food products, the agricultural upstream of production should be taken into account for this mechanism. In this way, land and soils use will be accounted for, as has been done in the past with ILUC in the RED Il. It should be recalled that EU sugar is made out of beet, a very efficient crop in terms of land use and water usage. Sugar produced outside the EU comes from cane, a tropical crop. In case the impact of cane on land is not taken into account in the mechanism, this could lead to undesirable situations of certain tropical forests being cut and burnt down in order to grow cane or to create space for other crops. This would be counterproductive and would not be in line with the Green Deal policies the EU Commission is currently putting in place.\nA further aspect that seems not to be taken into account is the fact that European sugar manufacturing brings further co-products as a result of the ETS-regulated processes of a beet sugar plant, such as: a large stillage of feed (several sorts of beet pulp), fertilizers (carbonatation lime), raw materials for fermentation and alcohol production. All of these products need to be taken into account by creating a system of CO. calculation for a border tax adjustment scheme to come to fair and coherent policy option replacing the present system of free allocations. Comparing sugar from abroad with European beet sugar needs to include the impact of those co-products into the scope of the future mechanism by allocating the correct emission share to each of these products. Only this procedure will represent a realistic carbon leakage protection, not mentioning the above-mentioned environmental impacts of our competitors on tropical crop level.\nc. While a protection on export level is not planned (and perhaps legally not feasible), a Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism (CBA) will constantly suffer only to manage one side of the carbon leakage medal. Therefore, facing an environment of distortion-free international trade relations, the question may be allowed whether it could really be a considerable policy option. If border (customs-based) measures cannot be implemented in order to fully cover the competitive gap (either on exports or imports), alternative and/or additional compensation systems should be envisaged.\nWe therefore request the European Commission to efficiently protect our sector with a more effective system taking into account the high performance of the EU sugar sector regarding agricultural, environmental and social standards,\n2. Bureaucracy\nNo doubt that a well working CBA will be based on a lot of results of international negotiations and well agreed international regulation. Facing the huge time and effort this will need to be achieved without any risk of retaliation measures from the WTO members, and the fact that it can only be an intermediate result on international level until 2050 we are asking whether it will not\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium\n& +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope\npage 4o0f4\nbe the smarter way to keep the present system and to put all negotiation power in finding a common CO: price on global level directly.\n3, Benefits of the CBA\nThe potential revenues stemming from the CBA should be allocated to the transition to a low-carbon economy of our European industry.\nCEFS therefore requests for a fair treatment of EU industries in order to be protected against carbon leakage, for coherence and consistency between regulations and policies when proposals are made by the EU. Furthermore, we consider that a more global approach (taking into account production modes among others) in determining the scope of the mechanism for food products is required, especially for sugar.\nCEFS remains available for more information or any question you may have.\n9 Avenue de Tervuren 182 B-1150, Brussels, Belgium & +32 (0)2 762 07 60 &% cefs@cefs.org @ www.cefs.org 8 @SugarEurope"

It must allow for fair competition at global level and not simply to outsource “pollution”. While respecting the rules of the World Trade Organisation, the aim of this mechanism would be to be a key industrial policy tool in pursuit of a number of complementary objectives: \n\n1. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;\n2. Defending the highly strategic industrial sectors (such as the steel industry) of the European Union and thus defending the quality employment of workers employed directly or indirectly in these sectors;\n3. the application of fair competition at global level.\n\nThe reduction of greenhouse gases in energy intensive industries is generally achieved through innovation of disruptions. However, these technologies and disruptive innovations are and will become (increasingly) expensive, which could have a negative impact on employment in Europe if they are not properly managed, accompanied and supported. Therefore, it is crucial that the EU’s carbon adjustment policy is not in place on its own. It must be accompanied by a coherent set of policy measures (financial, fiscal, social, etc.). Thus, a policy/legal/regulatory/competitive environment conducive to innovation should be a prerequisite for the introduction of the carbon adjustment principle at the borders of the European Union. Specific measures in the award of public procurement could also be envisaged. The creation of a market that will be able to welcome these innovations is therefore essential. Similarly, a mechanism should be developed to support export industries. It is imperative to ensure that the impact of these measures on all parts of the value chain is properly assessed... without forgetting the establishment and maintenance of a genuine social dialogue with trade union organisations (at all levels: At European level, Member States, regions and each company concerned). The whole of the system, by any inadequacy, cannot, under any circumstances, miss its target... and damage entire sectors, building on the European industrial fabric. Conversely, care must be taken that one or more measures do not promote deadweight effects.

        "feedback": "Climate change is inextricably linked to economic inequality: it is a crisis that is driven by the greenhouse gas emissions of the ‘haves’ that hits the ‘have-nots’. Oxfam estimates of the scale of this inequality suggest that the poorest half of the global population – around 3.5 billion people – are responsible for only around 10% of total global emissions attributed to individual consumption. For years, developed countries have claimed they will not go beyond incremental targets to cut their emissions unless and until rapidly growing developing countries step up to cut their emissions too. While it is absolutely critical to any chance of averting the most dangerous impacts of climate change that all developing countries play their part too, it is worth remembering that the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries.\n- On Part C\nOverall, European Green Deal initiatives and legislation should undergo impact assessments and inter-service consultations to respect the ‘do no harm’ principle and policy coherence for sustainable development (PCSD). This is particularly important for the carbon border adjustment tax, which could impact domestic resources, exports and citizens in the Global South. \n- Likely social impacts\nIt is important to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalised by higher prices on essential products. Any environmental tax which is introduced must fit in a progressive tax mix. This means making sure that the polluter pays rather than further creating a burden on the poorest. When regressive effects of the tax are inevitable, compensation measures for the poorest should be introduced.  Ways of addressing this can include the provision of affordable alternatives and systems such as public transport as well as considering providing direct transfers to low-income households to mitigate the impact on their income.\n- Likely environmental impacts\nThe effectiveness of the instrument and alternatives should be carefully considered. Will a carbon border tax really discourage carbon leakage or greenhouse gas emissions in countries exporting to the EU? Or are there other better and more effective policy instruments that could be introduced, e.g. import standards regulations.\n\n- On Part D \n- Impact assessment\nImpact assessment should consider policy options to mitigate impacts on LDCs and the poorest. It is important to note that LDCs might lose exporting opportunities as a result of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which has repercussions among others on LDCs’ balance of payments. As such, the revenues collected from the CBAM should be earmarked for fairness purposes.  These earmarked revenues could (1) compensate the costs of climate-related losses and damages already being experienced by communities in the Global South, (2) finance adaptation measures and (3) fund investments to enable a just transition. In particular the revenues accumulated in the EU  via the CBAM, when imposed on products imported from developing countries, could be directed to the UN’s Green Climate Fund or a fund to stimulate different types of LDCs’ exports to the EU. When a CBAM applies to countries that are neither least developed countries nor developing countries, such as non-EU OECD countries, the proceeds could be used for redistribution in the EU to mitigate impacts on low-income households, or again to the UN’s Green Climate Fund. \n- Evidence base and data collection \nIt is important to consider additional sources of evidence related to impacts on developing countries and mitigating measures. \n- Consultation of citizens and stakeholders\nWe recommend consultation with CSOs on the impact that the measures can have on developing countries. We also suggest a longer period than 12 weeks for the public consultation to make consultation with CSOs meaningful. \n",

In this briefing Oxfam demonstrates the extent of global carbon inequality by estimating and comparing the lifestyle consumption emissions of rich and poor citizens in different countries.\nStrikingly, our estimates of the scale of this inequality suggest that the poorest half of the global population — around 3.5 billion people — are responsible for only around 10% of total global emissions attributed to individual consumption, ' yet live overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change.\nAround 50% of these emissions meanwhile can be attributed to the richest 10% of people around the world, who have average carbon footprints 11 times as high as the poorest half of the population, and 60 times as high as the poorest 10%. The average footprint of the richest 1% of people globally could be 175 times that of the poorest 10%.\nWhile COP21 in Paris will see a deal negotiated between governments on the basis of the total emissions produced in their territories, the real winners and losers will be their citizens. The litmus test of the deal will be whether it delivers something for the poorest people who are both the least responsible for and the most vulnerable to climate change, wherever they live.\nOxfam’s new data analysis, which attributes estimated total lifestyle consumption emissions for different countries to the varying income groups within them (see Box 1 for definitions and methodology), not only shows the extreme nature of global carbon inequality, but also helps bust some of the myths that have circulated around the UN climate talks for years about who is driving climate change.\n2 DECEMBER 2015\nThe poorest half of the global population are responsible for only around 10% of global emissions yet live overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change — while the richest 10% of people in the world are responsible for around 50% of global emissions.\nThe average footprint of someone in the richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%.\nwww.oxfam.org\nOXFAM\nComparing the average lifestyle consumption footprints of richer and poorer citizens in a range of countries helps show that while some ‘emerging economies’ like China, India, Brazil and South Africa have high and rapidly rising emissions, the lifestyle consumption emissions of even their richest citizens remain some way behind that of their counterparts in rich OECD countries, even though this is changing and will continue to do so without urgent climate action. The lifestyle emissions of the hundreds of millions of their poorest citizens, meanwhile, remain significantly lower than even the poorest people in the OECD countries.\nWhile the richest citizens can and should contribute as individuals to cutting their own emissions through lifestyle changes, wherever they live, they cannot solve the climate crisis through voluntary action alone. Their choices are often constrained by the decisions of their governments in all sorts of areas, from energy to transport policy. Without question, a weak agreement in Paris is no more in their interests than it is in the interests of the poorest and least responsible. Increasingly members of the richest 10% are experiencing the impacts of climate change themselves, and are mobilizing to demand action from their governments.\nThe only beneficiaries of inadequate climate action in Paris and beyond are a much smaller elite with vested interests in the continuation of a high carbon and deeply unequal global economy. Between the Copenhagen and Paris climate conferences, the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with interests in fossil fuel activities has risen from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, while the size of their combined personal fortunes has expanded by around 50% from over $200bn to more than $300bn.? Governments in Paris need to stand up to their influence, and stand up for their citizens — the poorest, lowest emitting and most vulnerable among them first and foremost — if Paris is to deliver an agreement for those who need it most.\nBetween the Copenhagen and Paris climate conferences, the number of billionaires with interests in fossil fuel activities has risen from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015. Their combined personal fortunes have expanded by around 50% from over $200bn to more than $300bn.\n‘We see Oxfam's report and our recent paper \"Carbon and inequality: from Kyoto to Paris\" as two halves of the same walnut. The two studies converge towards one key fact: individual carbon emissions are highly unequally distributed throughout the world. Oxfam claims that any successful agreement at the Paris COP should take into account within- country carbon inequalities — and climate change impacts. We could not agree more. Our proposal to progressively tax carbon emissions in order to finance climate adaptation and Oxfam's call to secure a low-carbon developing space for the world's have-nots are highly complementary.’\nLucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty Co-authors, ‘Carbon and inequality from Kyoto to Paris,’ Paris School of Economics\n‘This timely report from Oxfam leaves no doubt that the test of an effective and climate just deal from Paris is the extent to which it protects the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. They are after all least responsible for and the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nThe report shows that women bear the heaviest burden in a warming world; they are particularly at risk due to gender inequalities, a reliance on climate sensitive livelihoods and a lack of assets to fall back on in harsh times. The recommendations of the report for the Paris Agreement, targeting increased finance for adaptation, attention to human rights and gender equality and the need to phase out fossil fuels while phasing in access to sustainable energy for all, are the measures against which to evaluate success.’\nMary Robinson President, Mary Robinson Foundation — Climate Justice\n1 Climate change and economic inequality are inextricably linked\nParis is a deal between governments, but the real winners and losers will be their citizens. In this briefing Oxfam uses new data analysis to estimate and compare the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of different countries, in order to demonstrate the scale of carbon inequality both globally and within key countries.\nThose with most at stake in Paris are the poorest 3.5 billion people on the planet, responsible for only around 10% of the total emissions from individual consumption, yet living overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In the dataset used to generate these estimates, individual consumption is responsible for 64% of global emissions, with the remaining 36% attributed to consumption by governments, investments (e.g. in infrastructure) and international transport. However, a recent paper by Chancel and Piketty finds very similar results attributing all national consumption emissions to individuals, * suggesting that our approach is a good proxy for attributing the shares of total global emissions. Figure 1 shows the distribution of global income from the richest to poorest 10% of people globally, and Oxfam’s estimate of their associated lifestyle consumption emissions as a share of the global total.\nFigure 1: Global income deciles and associated lifestyle consumption emissions\nPercentage of COz emissions by world population\nRichest\n10%\nichest 10% responsible for almost half of total lifestyle\nconsumption emissions\nPoorest 50%\nresponsible for\nonly around 10%\nof total lifestyle\nconsumption\nemissions\nSource: Oxfam\nWe conservatively estimate that the average emissions of a person in the poorest half of the global population are just 1.57 tCO2 — that equals 11 times less than the average footprint of someone in the richest 10%.* The average emissions of someone in the poorest 10% of the global population is 60 times less than that of someone in the richest 10%.\nWhile estimates at the extreme top and bottom of the global income distribution are more difficult to make, there is no question the gap is much wider still: the richest 1% may emit 30 times more than the poorest 50%, and 175 times more than the poorest 10%° (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Lifestyle consumption emissions per capita from different global income levels®\n60\n50\nle\n40\n30\n20\n10\n1% Richest 10% Richest40% Poorest 10% Poorest Global\nAverage\nSource: Oxfam\nThe average emissions of someone in the poorest 10% of the world population is 60 times less than that of someone in the richest 10%.\nA recent World Bank Study found that in the 52 countries analysed, most people live in countries where poor people are more exposed to droughts, floods and heat waves than the average of the population as a whole.\nWhat is more, the poorest half of people on the planet live overwhelmingly in countries that are considered the most vulnerable to climate change.\nFigure 3: Examples of where in the world people in the poorest half of global population live, and the scale of their lifestyle consumption emissions footprints’\n- »\n~~\n‘Ss\n~~\naa\n,.\nae Least vulnerable\nWomen bear the heaviest burden ina warming world, generally more heavily dependent on climate- sensitive livelihoods and with least to fall back on in harsh times.\nMost vulnerable | | | | |\nSource: Oxfam; Centre for Global Development Climate Change Vulnerability Index\n\nThe poorest people on the planet are not only least responsible for causing climate change, they also tend to be the most vulnerable to its consequences and least prepared to cope. But such inequalities are horizontal as well as vertical — with women facing greater risks than men, rural communities often more exposed than urban ones and groups marginalized because of race, ethnicity or other factors likely to be disproportionately affected.\nA recent study by the World Bank found that in the 52 countries analysed, most people live in countries where poor people (defined as the poorest 20% of the national population) are more exposed to disasters like droughts, floods and heat waves than the average of the population as a whole — and significantly so in many countries in Africa and South East Asia.°\nWomen often bear the heaviest burden of all in a warming world.® They are generally more heavily dependent on climate-sensitive livelihoods (such as rain-fed agriculture, and collecting water for household use), and they often have the least to fall back on in harsh times or to help them escape a downward spiral in productivity (such as access to land, training or capital).\nSuch inequalities can be seen in rich countries too. The poorest residents in the Gulf states of the USA — Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama — are exposed to a disproportionate threat from coastal flooding as a result of rising sea levels.'° When Superstorm Sandy hit New York in 2012, 33% of individuals in the storm surge area lived in government-assisted housing, with half of the 40,000 public housing residents of the city displaced. \"'\nNot only are richer countries and the richer communities within them less affected by climate change, they also tend to be far better prepared to cope with it.'* In California, USA, irrigation covers over 80% of arable land, while in Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad it is less than 1%. While 91% of farmers in the US have crop insurance to cover losses in the event of extreme weather, only 15% of farmers in India are covered, 10% in China and just 1% or less in Malawi and most low-income countries.\nWhat is clear is that climate change and economic inequality are inextricably linked. It is a crisis driven by the ‘haves’, which hits the ‘have- nots’ the hardest. If there is to be any justice in the deal in Paris, governments must deliver something for the have-nots, wherever they live.\nBox 2: Estimating the distribution of lifestyle consumption emissions\nA technical summary of the methodology behind the estimates presented in this briefing is available at http://oxf.am/Ze4e. The approach adopted assumes an elastic relationship between income and emissions. Put simply, it takes data on income shares of different percentiles at the national level and distributes aggregate national emissions to those percentiles.\nIt draws on two datasets: national income distribution data from analysis by Branko Milanovic based on household surveys for 118 countries in the benchmark year 2008; and estimates of CO, emissions associated with household consumption (which we here term ‘lifestyle consumption emissions’) from Glen Peters based on a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) trade model, covering 121 countries, for the year 2007.\nCritically, the CO. model represents emissions from consumption rather than production. The underlying trade model allocates emissions associated with goods/services to the territory in which consumption takes place rather than the country in which the production occurs. This gives a more realistic picture of the actual emissions of citizens of different levels of income within a country. Emissions associated with consumption by governments, capital and international transport are therefore excluded. The proportion of total consumption emissions attributed to the lifestyle consumption of individuals varies by country, but globally accounts for around 64% of the total.\nOxfam’s estimates should only be considered indicative of the orders of magnitude, but also as conservative, for two reasons. Firstly a significant number of mostly low-income countries are missing from the datasets; if they were included it would lower the average per capita emissions of the bottom 50% poorest people, and lower the share of the global total attributed to the bottom 50%. Secondly, we have assumed a nationally determined threshold of minimum emissions, raising the lower end of the distributions that may otherwise produce emissions values lower than might be considered plausible. See the technical note for a description of the approach taken and rationale.\nWhile 91% of farmers in the US have crop insurance to cover losses in the event of extreme weather, only 15% of farmers in India are covered, 10% in China and just 1% or less in Malawi and most low-income countries.\nClearly there will have been some changes to the income and associated emissions distributions since the benchmark year for the data of 2008; however the orders of magnitude presented here — notably the difference between the richest and poorest people globally — are likely still to hold. There will likely be a smaller but still very significant share of the global poorest 40% in some middle-income countries like China and Brazil, where growth has been fastest and relatively more inclusive, and a growing representation of some middle-income countries in the global richest 10% (see section 2).\n2 Lifestyle consumption emissions are highly unequal within and between countries\nThese new estimates can also help to dispel some of the myths that have long circulated around the UN climate change talks about who is responsible for driving climate change.\nFor years, developed countries have claimed they won’t go beyond incremental targets to cut their emissions unless and until rapidly growing developing countries step up to cut their emissions too. '? While it is absolutely critical to any chance of averting the most dangerous impacts of climate change that all developing countries play their part too, it is worth remembering that the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries, and that there are significant differences in the consumption footprints of rich and poor citizens among those countries too. That is, it makes little sense to treat them as though they are a single bloc (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Per capita lifestyle consumption emissions in G20 countries for which data is available\nTop 10% = Bottom 50% HBottom 40% Average\nUSA\n|\nCAN\nLe\nGBR\nDEU\nITA\nRUS\nFRA\nJPN\nKOR\nZAF\nMEX\nTUR\nARG\nCHN\nBRA\nIDN\nIND\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nHousehold CO, per capita (tonnes)\nThe lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries.\nThe vast majority of the world’s richest 10% high emitters still live in rich OECD countries, although that is slowly changing.\n50\nThe majority of the world's richest 10% high emitters still live in OECD countries; around a third are from the US. While the total emissions produced in China divided on a per capita basis have now surpassed those of the European Union, “ the per capita lifestyle consumption emissions of even the richest 10% of Chinese citizens are still likely to be considerably lower than the richest of their OECD counterparts. '° This is because such a large share of China’s emissions is from the production of goods consumed in rich countries.\nAs recently as 2008 (when the latest publically available data used in these estimates was produced) the average emissions of a person in the richest 10% of Chinese citizens was about the same as the average carbon footprint of someone in the poorest 40% of Europeans. Even allowing for the rapid growth in the size of China’s economy since then, this is unlikely to have changed dramatically yet, given the sheer scale of the Chinese population.\nWith regard to India the differences are even starker. Oxfam’s estimates suggest that even the richest 10% of Indian citizens have per capita emissions just one-quarter of the poorest 50% of those from the US, while the poorest 50% of Indians have a carbon footprint that is just one- twentieth of the poorest 50% in the US.\nEven in absolute terms, the sheer scale of the gap between the responsibilities of the richest compared with the poorest is compelling (see Figure 3). While the huge populations of countries like China and India clearly contribute significantly to the global total of emissions from lifestyle consumption — again reinforcing the need for strong climate action in those countries — the poorest half of the Chinese population (over 600m people) have a total emissions footprint that is still only one- third that of the richest 10% of US citizens (around 30m people). The poorest half of the Indian population (around 600m people) emits only half as much again, about the same as the richest 10% of people in Japan (around 12m people).\nThe average emissions of the richest 10% of Indians is just one- quarter of the poorest half of the US population, while average emissions of the poorest half of the Indian population is just one-twentieth that of even the poorest half of the population in the\nThe poorest half of the Chinese population (over 600m people) have a total emissions footprint that is only one-third that of the richest 10% of US citizens (around 30m people).\nFigure 5: Total lifestyle consumption emissions in G20 countries for which data is available\nm= Top 10% = Bottom 50% mBottom 40%\nUSA Sg\nCAN\nGBR\nDEU\nITA\nRUS\nFRA\nJPN\nKOR\nZAF\nMEX eee\"\nTUR\nARG\nCHN\nBRA\nIDN\nIND\n200\n400\n600\n1,200\nTotal Household CO, (million tonnes)\nHowever what is also clear from the data in Figure 2 is that rapidly growing ‘emerging’ economies like China, India, Brazil and South Africa, while showing significant diversity in the income and emissions distributions of their populations, all have highly unequal economies with correspondingly highly unequal emissions footprints between their citizens. ©\nThe gap between the richest 10% and poorest half of the population is greater in South Africa and Brazil than in any other country in the G20. In South Africa, the richest 10% of citizens already have per capita lifestyle consumption footprints ten times that of the poorest half of the population. In Brazil, one of the few G20 countries to actually start to reduce shockingly high levels of inequality in recent years,’ their footprint is eight times as high.\nThe estimates presented here are based on the latest publically available datasets from around 2007/8, and in the period since then both the income and emissions of the richest citizens in these countries will have increased (although the sheer scale of the populations of countries like China and India means the orders of magnitude are unlikely to have shifted dramatically yet). Without ambitious action to tackle inequality and drive down emissions in these countries, not only will it be increasingly difficult to eliminate extreme poverty*® but also impossible to limit global warming below the 1.5C threshold that more than 100 countries have called for.\n1,600\nThe poorest half of the Indian population (around 600m people) has a total emissions footprint about the same as the richest 10% of citizens in Japan (around 12m people).\nIn South Africa, the richest 10% of citizens already have average lifestyle consumption footprints ten times higher than the poorest half of the population. In Brazil it is eight times as high.\n800\n1,000\n1,400\n3 Vested interests in a high carbon and deeply unequal global economy are holding us back\nWhile the richest citizens can and should contribute as individuals to cutting their own emissions through lifestyle changes, wherever they live, it would be wrong to conclude that they are solely responsible for solving the climate crisis, not least because their choices are often constrained by the decisions of their governments and the market forces they shape. Equally it would be wrong to conclude that a weak agreement in Paris is remotely in their interests.\nSuperstorm Sandy, Hurricane Katrina, the US droughts of 2010 and 2012, the on-going California drought: these are events that are directly impacting the lives and bank balances of the richest group of citizens in the world. In Europe, heat waves and flooding have taken thousands of lives and cost millions in damages. In Australia, wildfires put thousands of properties at risk each year. And even those who have not yet found themselves directly in harm’s way can increasingly feel the indirect consequences in their own lives linked to instability abroad, as food prices rise or people are forced to leave their homes.\nIncreasingly, the richest citizens recognize it too. Tens of thousands of members of the global top 10% joined the massed ranks of 400,000 people in the biggest march for action on climate change in New York last year. Unprecedented numbers are taking action ahead of the adoption of a new global climate agreement in Paris. From Australia to Canada, they are signing petitions, re-thinking their consumer choices, and increasingly voting for alternatives.\nThe only beneficiaries of inadequate climate action in Paris and beyond are members of a much smaller elite with vested interests in the continuation of a high-carbon and deeply unequal global economy. It is this group that governments in Paris must stand up to on behalf of their citizens; the poorest, least responsible and most vulnerable first and foremost.\nA weak agreement in Paris is not remotely in the interests of rich high emitters. The only beneficiaries of inadequate climate action are a much smaller elite with vested interests in the continuation of a high carbon and deeply unequal global economy.\n10\nBox 3: Global fossil fuel giants, mega profits, and the carbon baron billionaires who front these companies\nMultinational fossil fuel companies are some of the most profitable on earth — and behind the well-known brands is a club of carbon billionaires. These are the mega rich super-elite who have made their wealth from the business of driving climate change — for which the poorest and most vulnerable pay the highest price.\nBetween the Copenhagen and Paris climate conferences, the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with interests in fossil fuel activities has risen from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015. Over these five years, the size of their combined personal fortunes has expanded from over $200bn to over $300bn. '°\nThe fossil fuel industry has a lot to lose from ambitious climate regulation — and so it is not surprising that the sector spends millions of dollars every year lobbying to try to influence and delay government action — buying more years to pollute and protect their profits.\nFossil fuel interests declare spending €44m a year on lobbying the EU in Brussels — around €120,000 a day. In the US in 2013, the oil, gas and coal industries spent almost $157m on lobbying — over $430,000 per day, or $24,000 per hour. By comparison, the entire alternative energy sector spent the same amount on lobbying in one year as just the top two spending oil giants, according to the Overseas Development Institute and Oil Change International. As these are self-reported figures in Washington DC and Brussels alone, they are clearly just the tip of the iceberg.~°\nAll this investment clearly buys results. One clue is in the subsidies and tax breaks awarded to the fossil fuel sector, which as the OECD shows far outweighs support to the renewables sector. The US government provides $5.1bn each year in tax deductions for exploration. In each annual budget, President Obama has attempted to repeal some of the most egregious tax breaks, but has been blocked by Congress — many of whose members rely on campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry. The US is now the world’s largest producer of both oil and gas, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.”\nThe fossil fuel industry declares spending €44m a year on lobbying the EU in Brussels — around €120,000 a day. In the US in 2013, the oil, gas and coal industries spent over $430,000 per day, or $24,000 per hour on lobbying.\n11\n4 Recommendations: A Paris climate deal for the poorest, least responsible and most vulnerable people\nWhile Paris can only be part of the package of measures needed to confront the interlinked crises of economic inequality and climate change, it is vital that it strikes a blow for climate justice in the interests of the poorest, lowest emitting and most vulnerable people, wherever they live. This means the agreement must meet the following four litmus tests as a minimum:\n1. Does it deliver fair emissions reductions that will keep open the chance of limiting warming below 1.5C?\ne Does it include a ratchet mechanism that ensures the inadequate emissions cuts pledged by countries (INDCs) are increased fairly and adequately by 2020, and every five years thereafter? Does it include a long-term global mitigation goal to see fossil fuel emissions fairly phased out and 100% sustainable renewable energy — with universal access — phased in by early in the second half of the century, with developed countries leading the way and providing the support that developing countries require to do the same?\nDoes it deliver a major increase in adaptation finance?\nDoes it include a dedicated collective adaptation finance target that will see at least 50% of public climate finance (or at least $35bn per year) dedicated to adaptation by 2020 as part of a clear roadmap to meet the commitment to mobilize $100bn per year? Does it include new separate climate finance targets for both adaptation and mitigation in the post-2020 agreement set on five yearly cycles, with the level of the adaptation target set commensurate with the level of global mitigation ambition? Does it include a commitment to a major increase in resources for the Green Climate Fund during its first replenishment from 2017, and immediately for the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund to ensure a fast-tracking of adaptation resources for those countries, communities and especially women that need them most? Does it include a commitment to establish new innovative sources of adaptation finance to halt the stretching of Overseas Development Assistance budgets, such as earmarking of revenues from the European Financial Transaction Tax, and commitments to ensure that carbon pricing schemes direct revenues from high polluters to those least responsible and worst affected by climate change, such as through an automatic set-aside of emissions allowances in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for the Green Climate Fund?\n3 Does it recognize the need to address loss and damage from the impacts of climate change to which it is not possible to adapt as a formal part of the new regime, distinct from adaptation?\n4. Does it recognize the need to respect the principles of human rights, gender equality and the need for a just transition for workers in the implementation of climate policies at the core of the agreement?\n12\nNOTES\n1 The emissions estimates presented in this paper refer to emissions from individual consumption rather than national production, based on the estimates of national consumption emissions provided by Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo. In total, individual consumption makes up 64% of global emissions in the Peters dataset, with the remaining 36% attributed to government consumption, investments (in infrastructure etc) and international transport. A similar study by Chancel and Piketty uses the same dataset but assumes that government consumption and investments can also be attributed to individuals as the ultimate beneficiaries, and finds very similar results. Therefore while Oxfam’s estimates strictly relate to the shares of total global emissions associated with individual consumption, they are also sound proxies for the shares of all global emissions. 2 Forbes, Billionaires list, available in real time at http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/#tab:overall Annual data taken from list published in March of each year. Billionaires were coded as having business interests or activities in the fossil fuel sector if the description of the source of wealth was interpreted to be related to the fossil fuel sector. In some cases the source of wealth is explicitly listed as ‘oil’, ‘coal’, or ‘gas’, or upstream/downstream sectors like ‘oil refining’, or ‘pipelines’. In others the company name, such as Lukoil, a Russian oil company is given. Some billionaires have interests in more than one sector, including fossil fuels. These are not the same individuals over time; some billionaires may enter or exit this elite group from year to year.

Piketty (2015) ‘Carbon and Inequality from Kyoto to Paris: Trends in the global inequality of carbon emissions (1998-2013) and prospects for an equitable adaptation fund’, http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/ChancelPiketty2015.pdf Global total household consumption emissions in 2007 were 17,187,821,112 tCO2. The top 10% richest people globally have per capita emissions of 17.60 tCOz and total emissions of 8,431,448,890 tCOz, while the bottom 50% poorest people globally have per capita emissions of 1.57 tCOz and total emissions of 1,791,265,686 tCO2. The average per capita emissions of the top 10% are therefore around 11 times higher than the average emissions of the poorest 50%, and the total emissions of the top 10% are nearly 5 times higher than the total emissions of the poorest 50%. See technical briefing for full methodological explanation and findings. Since we do not consider our approach sufficiently robust at the decile level, we have estimated the lifestyle consumption emissions of the richest 1% on the basis of the richest 10% of citizens in the US, which make up around half the global 1%. See note 5. The climate vulnerability map is reproduced from Wheeler, David (2011) ‘Quantifying Vulnerability to Climate Change: Implications for adaptation finance’ http://www.cgdev.org/page/mapping-impacts-climate-change. Given the countries missing from Oxfam’s income/emissions model, the population size per country of the global bottom 50% is estimated as those living below $4.40/day in 2012 in 2011 PPP, based on World Bank data which shows approximately 50% of population in developing countries live below this income level — based mainly on consumption data. The $4.40/day in 2011 PPP is approximately $2.80 in 2005 PPP, or $1022/year. The lower limit of the range of emissions on the map is based on the estimated emissions of the bottom 10% poorest in that country. The upper limit is based on identifying the percentile of each country's population that has the highest income from the world income distribution in 2008 (2005 PPP) that is still below $1022/year and reporting the estimated emissions per capita of that group. The map and these calculations are intended purely for illustrative purposes of the types of countries where the world’s poorest 40% live, and the scale of their emissions footprints. 8 S.

Although there are some differences to our respective methodologies, Chancel and Piketty estimate that 10% of the top 10% highest emitters are from China. This would mean around 5% of the Chinese population is amongst the top 10% highest emitters globally (compared to approximately 70% of US citizens), meaning that the top 10% highest emitters in China are very likely significantly lower than the top 10% in OECD countries (note that the Chancel and Piketty study represents its findings in terms of the top 10% highest emitters, while in this paper we look at the top 10% richest people, although there is significant overlap in our findings).\n16 The highest proportion of the world’s poorest people now live in Middle Income Countries, see http://www.cgdev.org/files/1424922_file_Sumner_brief_MIC_poor_FINAL.pdf\n17 See for example: http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/for-richer-or-poorer-the-capture- of-growth-and-politics-in-emerging-economies-578757\n18 See for example: https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/cr-even-it- up-extreme-inequality-291014-en.pdf\n19 Forbes Billionaires List, op cit.\n20 H.

Given the reach of our business and our brands, PepsiCo recognises the important role we can, and must, play in engaging and mobilising our supply chain to transition to climate neutrality.\nIn the spirit of providing constructive input, this note lists several elements we hope will be considered as and when any carbon border adjustment mechanism is developed.\n1. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EUROPEAN BUSINESS\nPepsiCo supports the introduction of a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism to address carbon leakage that may occur through imports. We believe a well-designed and evidence-based CBA mechanism could level the economic playing field, ensure the competitiveness of European based companies that are more carbon-efficient than competitors abroad, and encourage low-carbon economic production within Europe and its trading partners.\nThe CBA mechanism needs to identify carbon leakage risks not only for existing production facilities and operations within the European market but also with respect to new capacity expansion and economic growth, therefore preserving Europe’s attractiveness for both domestic and foreign investment.\n2. STRENGTHEN EUROPE’S GLOBAL ROLE IN CLIMATE ACTION\nEurope’s climate neutrality goal confirms the leading role Europe is playing on climate action. The introduction of a CBA mechanism would be a strong tool for the EU to strengthen its global leadership role\nS PEPSICO\nand encourage trading partners towards higher and aligned climate ambitions. A CBA could, for example, boost innovation into less carbon-intensive and more sustainable products within and outside the EU.\n3. CBAAS PART OF THE BROADER TRADE SYSTEM\nPepsiCo believes the CBA mechanism should be fully aligned to existing WTO guidelines to avoid potential obstruction of global trade. As CBAs develop over time, the European Commission may need to consider the establishment of a Carbon Custom Union with trading partners that have similar carbon reduction ambitions, encouraging those economies to harmonise their carbon pricing policies and therefore obviating the need for CBAs between them, allowing for frictionless trade internally and a common CBA externally.\nThe CBA should also be complemented by bilateral trade measures with EU trading partners that support the EU climate neutrality goal. In particular, PepsiCo believes that bilateral trade agreements with third countries should have measures to encourage less carbon-intensive products before applying a CBA mechanism.\nBroader alignment with the existing trade system should factor in the way the CBA mechanism would apply to countries that already have a carbon policy in place, and therefore find a balance between securing equal treatment to all trading partners according to WTO guidelines, while also avoiding double taxation of products.\n4. DESIGNING A TRANSPARENT AND FEASIBLE CBA IMECHANISM\nPepsiCo supports the effort led by the Commission to fully assess the potential impact the CBA mechanism would have on the European economy, environment and society. A CBA mechanism is a necessity to deliver on any ambitious climate policy but we are aware of the difficulties in combining such mechanism with the existing cap and trade scheme, which focuses on facilities as opposed to goods, thus presenting significant complexity in matching EU carbon pricing to the carbon intensity of imported goods. The European Commission will also need to present a transparent mechanism with respect to the basis for calculation, measurement of emissions, revenues, penalties for non-compliance and other critical design issues.\nThe CBA mechanism should be designed in a transparent, science-based and collaborative way while also maintaining confidential business information through supportive regulations.\nWe ask that when defining the sectors that would be impacted by the CBA mechanism, the Commission prioritises alignment between those covered by the ETS within the EU and those that will be covered externally so to ensure a fair and competitive level playing field and a uniform carbon pricing."

        "feedback": "The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) supports the concept of fully integrating the external environmental cost of products and consumption, including for goods that are imported to the EU. This is not being done in a satisfactory way today and in many EU countries, including Sweden, emissions per capita are higher than perceived if consumption-based emissions are accounted for. Further, SSNC fully supports that economic policy instruments in the EU should favour ambitious climate action and increase costs for environmentally damaging activities regardless of where they occur. \n\nA Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) has the ability to address both of these issues. If designed correctly, it could address the consumption-based emissions embedded in consumption goods being imported to the EU, while at the same time allowing for an appropriate and higher carbon pricing within the EU. Therefore, SSNC is positive towards the European Commission exploring if and how a CBA can be implemented. SSNC holds that a policy tool like CBA likely will be necessary to deliver on the EUs long-term climate goals.   \n\nSSNC would like to give the following recommendations to the European Commission regarding the development of a CBA:\n\n-\tSupporting a CBA does not imply that SSNC agrees with the notion that the EU industry suffers from carbon leakage, as this is still largely unproven. In this regard, a CBA will need to be complemented by a total phaseout of all free allowances that are currently being distributed to high emitting industries under the EU ETS, taking effect immediately. This must not be compromised. Giving out free allowances goes against the Polluter Pays Principle, and a CBA is therefore a better policy instrument to prevent possible carbon leakage, while allowing for a higher carbon price. \n-\tIdeally, the sectoral or product scope of the CBA should be as wide as possible to strengthen the environmental justification of the measure and for the tool to be able to address consumption-based emissions. SSNC recognizes, however, that applying a wide scope initially might increase administrative burden. For the sake of not delaying implementation, SSNC therefore supports that the Commission assess pros and cons of different sectoral or product scopes and, if necessary, make a proposal for a gradual inclusion of sectors starting with 1) carbon-intensive basic goods (e.g., cement, steel) and deforestation risk commodities; 2) industrially processed goods; and 3) others. \n-\tTo assist the implementation of a CBA, all industries and medium-large companies should start accounting for emissions from the whole value chain, including Scope 3, and the Commission should offer support in this regard.\n-\tThe sole objective of the CBA must be fighting climate change, and the CBA must not be used as a protectionist measure for EU industry. In this regard, the CBA should apply to imports only, and not also benefit exports. \n-\tTo avoid that the CBA result in negative equity impacts, it should be possible to grant exemptions for products (excluding hydrocarbons) from Least Developed Countries and countries responsible for a de minimis level of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n-\tRevenues from the CBA should be earmarked to further climate action in the EU or to assist affected lower-income countries to cut back on the carbon intensity of their economies.  \n\nNo measure known as a CBA has ever been implemented fully anywhere in the world. Putting in place a CBA is therefore likely going to be a big challenge, from a methodological and possibly legal point of view but also in terms of convincing trade partners of the usefulness and justification of the measure. In this regard, SSNC would like to stress that any reform or adoption of other policy measures, including adopting a new and revised 2030 climate target, must by no means be delayed while a CBA is being developed and negotiated.

This will therefore lead all European industry sectors to accompany this transition by investing heavily in decarbonising their production and at the same time offering low-carbon solutions to their customers.\n\nIn order to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the European Union and not just relocate our production to countries less concerned with their impact on the climate, it will be necessary to be able to finance these investments while maintaining the competitiveness of our means of production. This will be all the more difficult given that, with the Coronavirus pandemic, industry is heavily affected and their investment capacity is severely reduced or even non-existent.\n\nUNIDEN welcomes the explicit recognition of the need to put in place measures to preserve the competitiveness of European industry in order to combat climate change more effectively without transferring emissions from our consumption patterns to other countries. \n\nIn order to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, i.e. an increase in imports of products with a high carbon footprint to the detriment of low-carbon European production, UNIDEN considers that the introduction of a carbon inclusion mechanism at the borders of the European Union could — subject to appropriate arrangements and following an impact assessment — be able to preserve the competitiveness of European industry vis-à-vis industry located in regions or countries where the carbon constraint is much lower or even non-existent. \n\nHowever, such a mechanism will have to meet a number of conditions, and in particular must not jeopardise existing carbon leakage prevention schemes, in particular for energy-intensive companies; it will also have to be linked with appropriate measures to preserve the competitiveness of the downstream sectors.

        "pdf_text": "WK (Of\nWIRTSCHAFTSKAMMER OSTERREICH\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nInception Impact Assessment by the European Commission\nWKO Statement\nThe Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (Wirtschaftskammer Osterreich, WKO)' supports the goal of the European Climate Policy to attain climate neutrality by 2050. Given the massive negative repercussions of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the European population, business and industry, all relevant considerations, measures and instruments - including preparations for a possible Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - must focus primarily and unequivocally on providing the best possible support to companies to achieve the necessary recovery and the transformation towards a low-carbon economy and must strictly avoid unilateral steps to tighten up European framework conditions in ways that could weaken our companies’ international competitiveness.\nStricter EU greenhouse gas reduction goals will, in any event, lead to even higher costs for European enterprises. At present, it is completely unclear how leeway and prospects for investments to drive the recovery and safeguard the future of company sites are supposed to exist in light of this development and without an international level playing field. However, these investments are a fundamental prerequisite for the dynamic innovation and growth that policymakers and all of us are hoping the European economy will soon be able to exhibit again.\nWKO therefore suggests the following ranking of priorities in further considerations regarding a CBAM:\ne The main goal for the EU must be to create a level playing field pursuant to standardized carbon pricing at international level. This goal always has to be top of mind in the preparations for a CBAM. As long as the requirements for a level playing field are not in place, it is absolutely mandatory to retain comprehensive and complete protection against carbon leakage (direct and indirect) within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) at least until the end of phase four in 2030 and to expand that protection if need be. In parallel with and supplementary to these efforts plausibility checks, considerations and preparations can be initiated in individual ETS sectors on the possible implementation of a temporary CBAM. Absolutely imperative prerequisites for this step are comprehensive impact assessments in the individual sectors, with due account taken of the possible repercussions that a CBAM could have on the entire value chain and on the competitiveness of the individual sectors, which varies widely in some cases.\n1 https: //www.wko. at/service/Austrian-Economic-Chambers.html (English version)\ne A CBAM must not endanger an effective common EU trade policy, towards its trading partners, within ongoing and future EU trade agreements or EU efforts within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international conferences or organizations. In any case, steps have to be taken to ensure that a future CBAM is designed to be WTO-compliant. e The entire process must proceed in close consultation with the affected sectors and include considerations about the type and amount of financial cost compensation in line with validated and internationally applicable reference values as well as effective and transparent monitoring, verification and reporting.\nQuestions and concerns regarding a CBAM\ne There is a real danger that the introduction and administration of a CBAM would pose an overwhelming additional administrative, personnel and financial burden on internationally active companies in the EU. This would run counter to the many years of EU efforts to promote international trade relations and to support companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in conducting international trade. A CBAM must not become a bureaucratic monster that saddles EU companies with extensive obligations to furnish documentation and evidence, etc. in cross-border deliveries within the EU as well as in global value chains. Before a possible introduction of a CBAM for selected, highly exposed sectors, a comprehensive impact assessment has to be conducted for each sector individually to determine possible legal, trade and economic policy repercussions. An impact assessment of this kind must also address the interconnections within the value chains in each sector and evaluate the effects of a CBAM on them. The results of this impact assessment will determine whether the introduction of a CBAM is necessary and if so, how it can be implemented in a proportionate, carefully targeted, and practical way. The introduction of a CBAM in the EU could result in our trade partners imposing countermeasures and sanctions in the form of restrictions on European exports to their markets. Countermeasures and sanctions would have far-reaching negative repercussions on business, trade and employment in the EU and must therefore be avoided on any account. Building up and maintaining global value chains and trade flows for internationally trading enterprises is a medium to long-term process and highly intensive in terms of time and resources. Global value chains must not be endangered by a CBAM. In the discussion thus far, important preparations have been lacking: the possible repercussions of a CBAM on the trade relations of the EU with its partner countries, strategies of the EU to prevent sanctions and retaliatory measures as well as strategies in the event that third countries impose sanctions. Studies and impact assessments on these matters must be conducted and must be submitted and discussed as quickly as possible, in any case prior to the presentation of a Commission proposal.\nPolicy recommendations and practical demands\nIt is vital that the European Commission follows the principles below in the interest of Europe’s competitiveness:\n1) The EU and its Member States must make intensive efforts to achieve internationally standardized carbon pricing. 2) The existing carbon leakage regulations for direct and indirect carbon costs have to be further improved and expanded. A CBAM must also take into account indirect carbon costs from imported goods. These costs impose massive additional cost burdens in electricity-intensive sectors of the EU ETS. As long as this inclusion of indirect carbon costs is not assured, compensation of indirect carbon costs under the EU ETS State Aid Guidelines must be fully retained and also implemented in Austria, or further harmonized across the EU. 3) The actual provisions of a CBAM must take into account the obligations of the EU within the WTO and towards its partners in trade agreements. If the EU in general lowers or eliminates tariffs on goods within the WTO and its trade agreements, it is difficult to argue that the tariffs should be raised on several of these goods or that market access should be restricted. Likewise, a CBAM and autonomous EU tariff suspensions or tariff quotas have to be reconciled in a way that does not hamper trade flows in an unintentional way. Simultaneously applying a CBAM and trade defense instruments (anti-dumping, anti-subvention, safeguard measures) on imported goods might also show adverse economic effects. The geopolitical and strategic goals of EU trade policy are to export EU values and standards worldwide through treaty-based cooperation and to take on an increasingly significant role in setting the rules for international business and trade. These goals must not be endangered by introducing unilateral trade restrictions of a CBAM kind. 4) If the EU Member States agree on a necessary and proportionate CBAM that can be practically implemented, the EU must in any case intensify and make more concrete its efforts of clarification, acceptance and alliance building towards its trade partners and in the scope of international agreements and organizations. The global challenge of climate change requires that ambitious climate protection measures be not limited to Europe. Striving for international agreements and actions is in any case preferable to an autonomous EU measure such as a CBAM. This assertion is backed by various studies that largely favour international instruments for agreeing climate goals to autonomous measures by individual international players (refer to Sapir, Horn/Sapir). 5) There is a lack of studies, analyses and statistics on the repercussions of a CBAM on the European economy and international trade flows in goods, services or investments. It is striking that the Inception Impact Assessment neither mentions studies, analyses and statistics nor names them as a vital part of future impact assessment. However, from the standpoint of the business community, they are a precondition for a serious discussion of a CBAM. Knowledge about possible repercussions of a CBAM on the trade relations of the EU with its partner countries is lacking, as are strategies of the EU to prevent sanctions and retaliatory measures as well as strategies in the event that third countries impose sanctions. By contrast, the consultation paper of the European Commission expressly announced a study “on the measure as well as other on-going studies notably on the energy markets and on the EU ETS”. Studies on all named topics (repercussions on business and trade relations, on the energy markets and the EU ETS) must be presented as quickly as possible, so that they can be incorporated in the preparations for a Commission proposal regarding a CBAM. 6) The carbon pricing structure underlying a CBAM and thus the calculation of any import tariff has to be strictly oriented to the principles of non-discrimination,\nnecessity, proportionality, scientific character, and transparency. This structure\nwill be crucial for the evaluation of conformity with valid obligations of the EU and its Member States within the WTO or other international agreements and for evaluation on the part of the affected trade partner countries. 7) The funds collected through a CBAM must flow to business as well as research and development for new climate protection measures in the EU, especially the development and upscaling of industrial low-carbon technologies. 8) The introduction of a CBAM must not impose unrealistic or unilaterally onerous goals for companies in the EU. 9) In determining new goals, provisions must be made for corresponding flexibilities, e.g. in the form of temporary exceptions, transitional periods, support measures, etc. 10) A CBAM must not undermine or incompletely replace existing carbon leakage measures, in particular free allocation of allowances in the scope of the EU ETS and compensation of indirect carbon costs in the scope of the ETS State Aid Guidelines. 11) Retention of free allocation within the EU ETS as part of carbon leakage protection: The coexistence of existing carbon leakage measures does not lead to an impermissible double regulation to the extent that the carbon leakage regulation permits free allocation of carbon certificates in the scope of the EU ETS (EUAs) only in connection with attaining the benchmark, and further is degressive in nature due to the annual reduction factor of 1.74% (or 2.2% for 2021-2030). 12) A CBAM must not lead to any shortage of or increased prices for raw materials not available in the EU in sufficient quantities or quality. Moreover, a CBAM must not lead to any disproportionate disadvantages in the further processing of imported raw and primary materials and intermediate and semi-finished products and in the use of energy sources in relation to the use of equivalent products manufactured in the EU. Otherwise, the global market competitiveness of a large part of European industry would be seriously weakened instead of being strengthened. 13) From the outset, a CBAM should be limited to a certain period of time undergoing\ncurrent evaluation as well as final reporting.\nVienna, March 2020"

In this context the comments contained in this position paper should therefore be understood only as a technical contribution to the debate concerning Carbon Border Adjustments in the context of the inception impact assessment and future impact assessment.\nOn 11 December 2019, the President of the\nCommission, Ursula\nder\nunveiled the\nEuropean von Leyen, “European Green Deal” and the proposed the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism. With more than 1.200 installations in ETS manufacturing products as diverse as bricks & roof tiles, wall & floor tiles, refractory ceramics for industrial kilns, sanitaryware, expanded clay, clay pipes, tableware or flower pots, the European ceramic industry is well positioned to understand under which conditions Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) can be an effective instrument to help energy intensive industries moving towards carbon neutrality while remaining fully competitive, safeguarding economic and social aspects while achieving environmental goals. These 1.200 ceramic installations are mostly small emitters, representing more than 10 % of all ETS installations but less than 1% of ETS sectors’ carbon emissions. Largely composed of SMEs competing at global level, the ceramic industry is highly sensitive to overly complex and burdensome regulations and requires well balanced and simplified policy instruments.\nIn this context, Cerame-Unie sees the need for the impact assessment to take into account the following considerations:\nCeram\nUni\nbe\nThe European Ceramic\nIndustry Association\n31 March 2020\n1) Carbon Border Adjustments should be designed to strengthen carbon leakage protection in the long term\nDepending on the outcome of the ongoing decision making process on ETS benchmark updates and on the fluctuations of the carbon price (from 30€ to 50 €/tCO2), the European ceramic industry anticipates an ETS cost under Phase IV ranging from € 1 Billion to € 3 Billion, assuming that carbon leakage measures and the 2030 targets for the ETS sector remain unchanged. In the absence of any carbon leakage measure, the cost for the sector would range from € 3.8 Billion to € 6.3 Billion. Over the last years the European ceramic industry has done great investments to maintain its competitiveness in a globalised economy and reduce the carbon content of its products. Any decrease of the carbon leakage protection foreseen until 2030 would significantly jeopardise the ability of the sector to further invest in new and breakthrough technologies or to develop key technologies further to bring them to the market (marketability).\nPolicies merely increasing carbon costs on EU manufacturing without duly considering the carbon leakage risk will reduce EU carbon emissions from manufacturing as a result of relocation but will increase the EU’s consumed carbon due to imports from countries with lower or non-existing carbon costs on manufacturing. That is why the main objective of CBAs should be to strengthen existing carbon leakage measures.\n2) The CBA proposal shall be adapted to the characteristics of different industrial sectors\nSince the objective of CBAs will be to create an incentive for the decarbonisation of EU imports, this tool may only make sense for products where the EU market penetration of imports is already high. Consequently, CBAs should primarily be targeted at sectors that are import intensive (as opposed to export intensive). However, CBAs should always be conceived as a tool to complete and strengthen existing carbon leakage measures so as the deliver a genuine level playing field, not to replace those carbon leakage measures.\nMoreover, considering the potential legal and technical complexity of CBAs, such measures seem to be mainly feasible for homogeneous processes and products perceived as commodities.\nFor sectors such as the ceramic industry which has been considered as exposed to carbon leakage not because of import penetration but more as a result of a high carbon intensity combined with high exposure to exports and other market characteristics (e.g. low profitability and cost pass through ability, prospective exposure to imports, exposure to imports from countries in the peripheries of the EU, substitutability of products, etc.) while having a positive impact on the energy performance of buildings and contributing positively to the EU’s environmental goals through its longevity and recyclability, CBAs would certainly be less efficient in establishing a fair level-playing field than existing carbon leakage measures. Moreover, CBAs may prove very difficult to apply to heterogeneous products, disaggregated sectors and sectors with a high proportion of SMEs, three characteristics which prevail in the ceramic industry.\nFor such products and sectors as in the ceramic industry it will be even more important to ensure the continuation of existing direct and indirect carbon leakage measures (including compensation of the indirect costs for the next ETS trading period).\nCeram e— The\nUL Nit\nEuropean\nCeramic\nIndustry Association\n31 March 2020\n3) CBAs should preserve the competitiveness of European producers on export markets\nIt is necessary to ensure the competitiveness of EU exports to third countries, where the carbon constraint is absent or less ambitious than in the EU. The mechanism should thus include a solution for exports. For this purpose, additional measures should relieve from EU ETS extra-costs European products exported to non-EU markets without (or with less ambitious) carbon reduction policies. Since Art. XX of the GATT does not refer to the objective to maintain competitiveness as a ground to justify general exceptions, the EU institutions should explore all possible legal basis to secure a level playing field for EU exports, including Art. XVI of GATT on subsidies.\nMoreover, the risk of retaliation from our trading partners should not be underestimated. The US have already warned the EU about possible punitive measures against the EU if they found the system to be protectionist in its essence.\n4) CBAs should be WTO compatible\nThe mechanism needs to be fully WTO compatible, and thus should be built upon the key WTO principles of non-discrimination, differentiation and “likeness”. The possibility to derive from these principles shall be assessed under the exception allowed under article XX (g)* of the GATT, for environmental and climate objectives. The measure must be justified by the objective to reduce consumed carbon.\nAccordingly, the impact assessment by the European Commission should envisage different methods to determine the level of the carbon costs to be borne by imported products. Methods to be assessed include:\n- Carbon costs equivalent to the EU worst performers’ benchmark; - Carbon costs determined by the real monitored emissions corresponding to the imported product.\nThe assessment of these methodologies should take into account:\nThe capacity to deliver on the objective of reduction of domestic and global consumed carbon emissions; The ability to consider the full carbon content of products including the transportation phase of goods; The practical feasibility of these methods for different products and sectors, as different methodologies will entail different levels of complexity; The reliability and exposure to fraud and circumvention of these methods.\n1 Art. XX (g) of the GAAT: “Subject to the requirement that such not applied in which would measures are a manner constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures: (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption;”\nCeram\nUni\nbe\nThe European Ceramic\nIndustry Association\n31 March 2020\nBy no means should the Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism foresee the possibility to grant exemption to the benefit of imports from least-developed or developing countries. Considering the existing and future competition in many sectors between these countries and the European production, such exemption would seriously undermine the environmental objective of the measure.\n5) The proposal for CBAs should have a strong enforcement chapter\nThe CBA proposal should anticipate the risks of circumvention of the mechanism and should ensure that provisions are foreseen to prevent such unfair practices through traceability, certification of the carbon footprint (reflecting the full life cycle and including notably shipping emissions) and enforcement of the rules of origin. The mechanism should avoid the use of average data and privilege product specific environmental data.\n6) Revenues from CBAs should be allocated towards the low carbon transition of the European industry\nThe revenues resulting from the mechanisms should be allocated to transition and adaptation towards the carbon neutrality of the European industry through a harmonised approach that equally covers all ETS sectors across Europe.\n7) The impact assessment should also consider other regulatory instruments\nThe impact assessment should also assess the feasibility and efficiency of other regulatory instruments likely to strengthen the level-playing field by completing existing carbon leakage measures:\nA VAT type taxation applied to domestic products and imports reflecting their carbon footprint; The strengthening of EU Trade Defence Instruments, notably through a better consideration of environmental costs in the calculation of the dumping and injury margins; Improving traceability and enforcement of rules of origin; Other trade instruments: o Multilateral trade instruments: a Industrial subsidies and overcapacities (strengthening of WTO rules, use of EU anti- subsidy rules to tackle the absence of environmental costs as illegal subsidies) a Tax measures on transport a Further negotiations under Art. 6 of the UNFCC on emissions trading and carbon markets o Bilateral — Free Trade Agreements o Unilateral: a Public Procurement a General System of Preferences (GSP)"

I believe the levies derived by the carbon border adjustment measure should be held in trust by the EU, and redirected toward that country, once it gives an indication it would like to invest in infrastructure, research and development, technology transfer, etc., to lower the carbon intensity of the relevant sector, product or industry. For the time being, the EU could decide on the appropriate channeling, institutions and mechanisms of these funds, but hopefully this would kickstart a process for this to be adopted by an international body such as the WTO, whereby common accounting, payment etc. rules exist for all participating countries.

We thus appreciate the European Commission’s commitment to stop carbon and investment leakage, and ambition to address such issue with new tools like a CBAM.\nHowever, from a preliminary assessment of the Commission’s IIA Roadmap and discussion with our membership, we clearly see that a CBAM for the aluminium industry, which is one of the most, if not the most exposed sectors to carbon leakage, is not the best tool to achieve such policy objectives.\nOne of the\nreasons on producers’ GHG footprint. It is thus our view so far that adequate indirect costs compensation schemes and free allowances would still be the optimal way to protect our value chain from carbon leakage in Phase IV of the EU ETS’, given our sector’s significant electro-intensity in the production process and the specific global challenges we are facing, both in terms of trade and competitiveness.\nbehind this is that the carbon cost\nthe electricity price is delinked from the electricity\nAluminium production and its value chain is in fact very much different to other industries which are also exposed to Carbon Leakage, as for instance steel.

New Guidelines expected to be established later in 2020 and will set the rules throughout Phase IV up to 2030.

Any proposed mechanism should be WTO compliant, not undermine the existing framework, should avoid creating additional burden, and should foresee tools to effectively avoid its circumvention. Financial revenues from the system should be used primarily to encourage research and innovation in carbon-reducing technologies and investments for the decarbonisation of the European industry.\nIn light of the challenges and complexities above, it is our preliminary view that a CBAM for aluminium is not an adequate instrument to address carbon leakage in our sector. We invite the Commission to instead improve the existing framework and consider other tools to support our industry’s transformation and commitment to the EU’s Green Deal objectives. This especially in view of the announced higher climate ambition for 2030 and our sector’s unique and advanced electro-intensive nature compared to our energy intensive industries in Europe (e.g. chemicals, steel, cement).\nThe Aluminium value chain\nEurope’s aluminium production is already one of the least carbon-intensive in the world. Furthermore, the European aluminium industry’s carbon footprint will continue to decline as the European electricity mix decarbonises. Given\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nan\nEU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nCommission’s inception impact assessment, would have severe effects on the entire European aluminium value chain and its customers.\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/2\n/ Position on Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap for an EU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nthat the production process for primary aluminium is already fully electrified (in line with the Commission’s 2050 long-term strategy), the decarbonisation of the power sector alone will lead to a 58% decrease of the carbon footprint of Europe’s primary aluminium production by 2050 (compared to 2014 levels)’.\nAluminium’s unique properties and uses in energy-efficient products for buildings, packaging and mobility (amongst others) also make it an essential material in the transition towards carbon neutrality. It is a key element for the production of the technologies that will lead Europe towards carbon neutrality, such as RES units and electricity/data transmission grids. Recycling aluminium is another important way of saving CO2 emissions and energy.\nPreserving our primary and semi-manufacturing production as well as further developing our recycling activities will be absolutely necessary in order to meet the growing demand for aluminium products, while reducing our dependency on imports. The EU28 still imports approximately 50 percent of its aluminium ingot requirements’. Norway and Iceland, as part of the European Economic Area (EEA), are the largest exporters of primary aluminium to the EU. Other major exporters of primary products to European countries are Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Mozambique, while semi-fabricated and finished products are imported from several countries based on primary metal from China and others with high GHG footprint. Overall, domestic demand of aluminium is fulfilled through both primary and recycled production?.\nFurthermore, over the past five years, Chinese exports of aluminium products to the EU have more than doubled, particularly in the case of semi-fabricated products (flat rolled products, including foil, and extruded products). The carbon footprint of these imports is much higher than the equivalent European production (90% of Chinese primary aluminium production is based on energy from coal-fired power plants®).\nImportance of preserving existing carbon leakage measures\nCarbon intensity of primary aluminium production in Europe has decreased by more than half since 1990, via improvements in energy efficiency, reduction of PFC emissions and anode consumption from the electrolytic ’ process. However, carbon leakage is already happening in our sector because the carbon cost on the electricity price is delinked from the electricity producers GHG footprint: despite a growing global demand for our metal, Europe has lost more than 30% of its primary production capacity since 2008, and this production is being replaced by imports from other regions in the world. Aluminium competes with other materials in its key markets but, given its high electro-intensity, it faces different regulatory and cost challenges compared for example to steel.\nTo date, there are only 16 smelters remaining in the EU 28°, meaning that approximately half of our demand for primary material relies on imports from third countries. Of these imports, 30% come from 10 smelters in EFTA countries, Norway and Iceland, regulated under the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS). The idling of smelting capacity in the EU and the lack of investment in new capacity is explained to a great extent by the fact that Europe has higher electricity prices compared to its main competitors? (Russia, UAE and China), whereas electricity accounts for roughly 40% of primary aluminium production costs. Higher electricity prices in Europe are attributable to regulatory costs -mainly as a result of the EU’s climate-related policies- as is the case with power producers passing\n3 See European Aluminium Vision 2050 report here\n4 See European Aluminium Digital Activity Report 2018 2019, Market Overview here —\n5 See European Aluminium Vision 2050 report here 16: According to scenario analysis, with supportive policies by 2050, recycled and primary , p. our are expected to have almost equal shares of total European demand\n© See: http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminium-smelting-power-consumption/\n7 See European Aluminium Vision 2050 report here\n8 See European Aluminium Digital Activity Report 2018 2019, Section II: Market Overview here —\n2\nSee CEPS Study, commissioned by DG ENERGY, here “Composition and drivers of energy prices and costs in energy intensive industries”, 14 January 2019\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/3\n/ Position on Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap for an EU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\ncosts of buying emission allowances under the EU ETS (indirect carbon costs). No aluminium companies outside Europe face similar carbon costs, whereas various other regulatory costs are also exclusively European. Given that aluminium prices are set in global markets, European producers are not able to pass these extra costs on to consumers without losing significant market share. Furthermore, some players in the global aluminium industry are also heavily subsidised”®.\nTo this end, the Commission adopted in 2012 the Guidelines on certain State aid measures in the context of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme post-2012 (“2012 ETS Guidelines”) for the purpose of addressing the risk of carbon leakage. The guidelines allow Member States to compensate electro-intensive undertakings in sectors exposed to international trade, for the increase in electricity prices resulting from the EU ETS costs passed on by power producers, so called “indirect costs”. DG Competition is now reviewing the Guidelines for the trading period 2021-2030 (Phase IV) of the ETS. The European aluminium industry’s survival vis-a-vis competition from global players is absolutely dependent on the compensation of these ETS indirect costs, through Member States compensation based on these guidelines.\nETS indirect cost compensation is currently partial, degressive and uncertain across the EU. This has led to increased uncertainty for aluminium producers in Europe, who will face even higher carbon costs in phase IV of the ETS, thus adversely affecting their ability to engage in long-term planning (crucial for capital-intensive industries). The global competitiveness of our sector will also depend on the outcome of the evaluation of the Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection and Energy (EEAG), which will address incremental regulatory costs related to EU energy and climate policies under the upcoming European Green Deal initiative.\nTherefore, in the short term, the Commission should focus and improve the existing carbon leakage instruments for both direct and indirect costs by making them more adequate and proportional, which is absolutely necessary in order to protect the global competitiveness of Europe’s most electro-intensive sectors.\nPreliminary considerations\nAluminium production and the value chain is very much different to other industries, as for instance steel. This leads to numerous complications with regard to how a CBAM could effectively be implemented on imports of aluminium products. One example of a major challenge will be how to measure carbon intensity, considering aluminium’s unique electro-intensive in the smelting process and the related indirect emissions.\nThis means that the greater part of its carbon footprint consists of indirect emissions, unlike to steel and cement production, and therefore depends on the carbon content of the electricity grid.\nKeeping in mind these complexities, the Aluminium industry believes that:\ne A CBAM should not undermine or replace existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation, which should remain in place, be prioritised and improved; A CBAM must not replace, diminish or impair an effective trade policy, existing duties or affect trade defense measures like Antidumping and Anti-subsidy tariffs as well as Safeguards;\n10 See OECD report “Measuring distortions in international markets: the aluminium value chain”, January 2019: China affects international prices through subsidised dumping. It produces 57% of worldwide primary aluminium, compared to 10% 15 years ago. According to OECD, 85% of the $70bn support to aluminium companies worldwide went to just 5 Chinese firms.\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/4\n/ Position\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nan\nEU\n/\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nPolicymakers should carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors. If not carefully thought through and prudently implemented, there are concrete risks of increasing costs across the entire supply chain and thus eventually undermining (rather than protecting) our industry’s competitiveness in a world market; Overall, designing a system taking into account the specificities of the Aluminium value chain and global trade flows of the commodity, will be an extremely complex task; Any proposed mechanism should not undermine the existing framework, should avoid creating additional burden, and should foresee tools to effectively avoid its circumvention.\nIt will thus be paramount to first clearly assess the impact of a CBAM at each stage of the aluminium value chain.\nBorder adjustment vs carbon leakage measures\nSeveral proposals for a CBAM focus on levelling out the carbon costs faced by European producers with those of foreign producers. This would in theory mean that as a default, all imported products would face the same climate- related costs as products produced in Europe.\nThere are also proposals which foresee that producers in third countries would be able to apply for a company- specific assessment based on their actual emissions. This would mean that foreign producers with lower emissions than EU producers would pay less tax, but foreign producers with higher emissions than the EU average would not pay more than the default tax based on average EU costs. In order for a CBAM to have a clear climate rationale, it must ensure that a product with a higher carbon footprint is taxed higher than a similar product with a lower carbon footprint.\nThe challenge is how to measure the carbon footprint of aluminium and how to price it considering:\ne The absence of a global carbon market; Its electro-intensive nature; The issue of indirect emissions and indirect ETS costs; The issue of which price to be used for calculating a possible tax levy as long as the prices of EU allowances are volatile.\nHowever, even if a CBAM includes taxing indirect emissions in imported products, this would not protect European electro-intensive industry from carbon and investment leakage caused by the indirect CO2-costs, given the marginal pricing system used in European power markets:\nEuropean producers’ exposure to indirect EU ETS costs is determined by the carbon cost that is inherent in the marginal electricity price (regardless of the carbon content of the electricity that is actually consumed). Therefore, the only way to create a genuine level playing field (thereby ensuring WTO compliance) would be for the CBAM to also focus on indirect costs, rather than being limited to measuring indirect emissions\".\nIn other words, there is no direct link between the carbon content of the electricity consumed and the indirect costs passed on by power providers, which aluminium producers would producers face even when consuming completely decarbonised electricit via a renewable PPA). Electricit rices are set by the marginal unit, which is often a\n1 For marginal pricing EC Impact assessment SWD EU Electricity Markets reform (30.11.2016) and EC Impact assessment Report 2012 State more on see on on Aid Guidelines on indirect costs 22.05.2012\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n1/5\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Brussels, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Bru els, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nEU\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nnatural as or coal/lignite lant that faces carbon costs, and therefore all European electricit rices contain an . inherent carbon which is directly correlated the carbon footprint of the electricity in question. cost, not to\nAs a consequence, a CBAM setting an additional duty on an imported aluminum product based only on its environmental footprint (encompassing both direct and indirect emissions) would theoretically either:\nIt would however not be an effective tool for the short-term to ensure a level playing field with regards to production costs for European producers against the rest of the world. Therefore, indirect cost compensation would have to be maintained alongside such a scheme in order to prevent carbon leakage.\nKey principles for a CBAM fit for the aluminium value chain\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/6\nCOG\n/ Position\nan\n/\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\ne incentivise third country producers to reduce their footprint to avoid paying the additional duty; e or (more likely) cause a shift of trade flows so that low-carbon material is imported into the EU and the high- carbon material will remain traded outside the EU, thus failing to achieve the EU’s international commitment to push for the reduction of overall global emissions (in fact this would more likely lead to an increase in global emissions).\nEU policymakers are increasingly looking into how to design a CBAM to step up the EU’s climate ambitions vis-a-vis other global players. Bearing in mind the challenges and complexities above, we believe that should it cover Aluminium, the following conditions will have to be met and carefully considered in any future impact assessment work in order to preserve and grow our value chain in Europe:\ne A CBAM should not replace nor undermine existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation. ETS indirect costs compensation schemes should remain in place and not be diluted: only the European aluminium industry faces CO2 costs passed through electricity prices. For primary aluminium producers indirect EU ETS costs are 6 to 7 times larger than the direct costs. Due to the marginal price setting mechanism in the European power market, even a strongly decarbonised electricity supply will still bear indirect CO2-costs. For this reason, setting a CBAM on indirect emissions alone will not mitigate the carbon leakage risk due to indirect CO2 costs. Hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. The two can co-exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. A CBAM should put a price based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products and reflect the carbon costs: A CBAM should firstly have a clear climate rationale. A product with high carbon footprint should be taxed higher than a similar product with low carbon footprint. At the same time, in case the CBAM also covers indirect emissions, then it is crucial to ensure that the relevant calculations take into account the marginal pricing system used in European power markets in order to ensure a level playing field in terms of indirect costs. A CBAM would have to cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product containing the commodity. If this is not the case, the downstream segment might have an incentive to move production out of Europe, as importing the primary material would become too expensive. In addition, going down the value chain and depending on the specificities of each market, businesses may decide to delocalise in order to source components directly from abroad accessing them “CBAM-free”. This would threaten the survival of upstream producers in Europe. As an example: if only primary aluminium were covered by the CBAM, road wheel producers would move production out of Europe\n/ Position\non\nInception Impact Assessment Roadmap for\nan\nEU\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nApril 2020\nin order to avoid becoming uncompetitive and European automotive OEMs would source finished aluminium road wheels from abroad — CBAM-free. As explained above, due to marginal pricing, European electricity prices are impacted by the EU ETS cost, regardless of the GHG footprint of the electricity in question. For this reason, all well-designed and functioning tools designed to address industry CO2 emissions and carbon leakage, such as ETS free allowances and indirect compensation must remain in place. There should be no trade-offs and complementarity must be ensured. Related to this, the CBAM should not apply to countries that have joined the EU ETS system or that have similarly stringent tax systems on emissions; A CBAM should focus on emissions across the whole life-cycle of products: For example, the electrolysis process is where there are large differences in the CO2 emissions pattern, due to difference in indirect emissions (a result on the CO2 content of the electricity consumed). Other parts of the value chain have much less variation in emissions, though alumina production is also heavily reliant on carbon-intensive heat- production outside of Europe. Thus, the first focus of a CBAM should be on the carbon footprint of the primary metal, to then be used as a basis for further carbon footprint assessments along the value chain. For instance, if a downstream product is produced in Turkey with primary metal from South Africa, the carbon footprint of the downstream product should be based on both the South African footprint (with regard to the primary metal) and the Turkish one (with regard to processing in Turkey). A legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products will be needed, including the aluminium content in each product. A robust MRV system is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that third-country exporters are not able to circumvent (or otherwise ‘game’) the CBAM. For example, 90% of Chinese primary aluminium production is based on coal-fired electricity generation, whereas the remaining 10% is based on hydropower’. Therefore, without a robust disclosure system, a Chinese exporter could simply declare that its aluminium was produced using hydropower (even if this isn’t true), in order to bypass the CBAM. Third countries would be incentivized to re-route all their ‘cleaner’ production to Europe (displacing European production), while continuing to cover demand across the rest of the world using carbon-intensive production. This would actually lead to an increase in global emissions, i.e. carbon leakage. The CBAM system needs to be WTO Compliant: Aluminium is already highly politically exposed due to US Section 232 tariffs and the subsequent retaliatory actions. The introduction of a CBAM could trigger an avalanche of WTO complaints against the EU by third countries. If the EU lost the disputes, what could follow would either be the EU introducing changes to its CBAM system, which would create uncertainty for business; or WTO-authorized tariffs issued against the EU; The EU should be prepared for retaliation from other economies and assess its implications on EU companies’ market access in third countries. Financial revenues from the system should be used primarily to encourage research and innovation in carbon-reducing technologies and investments for the decarbonisation of the European industry.\nAvenue de Tervueren 168 - 1150 Bru els, Belgium\nPhone +32 2 775 63 63\n22 http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminium-smelting-power-consumption/\nEuropean-aluminium.eu\n/7\nCOG\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\n/\n/ Position on Inception Impact Assessment Roadmap for an EU\nCOG\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nEUROPEAN ALUMINIUM\nApril 2020\nTo conclude, all the elements above must be taken into account in upcoming impact assessment work, which should also include a sensitivity analysis of CO2 prices based on the impact of the CBAM and evolution of the carbon price.

The Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) adopted on the 11 of March 2020 puts clearly in the agenda that mandatory recycled content should be extended to other products, such as packaging, construction products, automotive.\nHowever, such EU regulations aiming at making the economy more circular result in increased costs in the whole product life cycle. Eco-design of products, selective collection of waste, sorting, depolluting, preparing for recycling: the whole production chain is more costly when based on recycling, than when using virgin materials.\nThat is why a CBAM should have under its scope the products that are covered, within EU, by mandatory recycled contents. That would be an essential tool against eco-dumping, and a necessary complement to mandatory recycled contents policies. It would strengthen European recycling markets, by consolidating the internal EU demand for recyclates, resulting in more investments in the recycling chain, and more competitive supply of recyclates in the EU market.\nIn addition, a CBAM would also facilitate closing the loop within the EU economy by sourcing more waste as material resources for industrial production.

This is in regard of the energy-transition and in context of the GreenDeal as proposed by the European Commission done from an approach of reaching Industrial Symbiosis. This approach is concretized through a 3 steps development towards a sustainable industrial cluster Rotterdam – Moerdijk in 2050.  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/sites/default/files/three-staps-towards-a-sustainable-industry-cluster-rotterdam-moerdijk-2050.pdf?token=Zo7BSWOU\n\nInstruments that would accommodate this process of transition towards a competitive and sustainable industry should support these developments. So we can deliver on a consolidation of industry in the most energy-efficient clusters and safeguard jobs and necessary production for the society. \n\nIn this context we want to reflect on the proposed instrument of a Border Adjustment Mechanism (Mechanism). What is needed is a consistent and coherent mix of public instruments which accommodate the transition. \n\nIn view of the current economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, Deltalinqs recommends to take caution with regards to the introduction of  additional taxes/levies that will initially affect consumers in their purchasing power and subsequently have a negative impact on the industry and trade as a whole.\n\nTo be truly effective we also ask that in the measures the effect of scope 2 and 3 emissions will be taken into account. That can mean that temporarily higher CO2 emissions in industry but which, on balance, turn out to be more favourable in scopes 2 and 3 are also conceivable. On these points, it is important that industry is encouraged to take the measures in scope 2 (more sustainable energy supply and energy savings) and scope 3 (residual heat, climate-neutral raw materials). So that within Europe there will be a strong basis for sustainble production and basis industries. \n\nThis is even more relevant for the current  impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the economy. This makes it urgent to get a clearer assessment on impact. So that this instrument does not lead to an increase in costs for end consumers.\n\nAlso relevant is the effect on the level-playing field in using the Mechanism. The Mechanism should not be used as a protectionary measure at the expense of the end consumer’s purchasing power. \n\nAs long as the origin of products cannot be traced properly, setting a Mechanism risks being a paper sham law in which European industry is insufficiently protected and where disproportionate emissions may still occur elsewhere in the world.\n\nTo sum up, we advise to be cautious with the introduction of additional taxes/levies in the short term. The Mechanism, if created, should be supportive in developing a robust and sustainble industry in Europe from the context of jobs and welfare. Finally the Mechanism should be proportionate and the Mechanism should be practically executable.\n",

It calls for a fundamental change in our energy and raw materials supply. Curbing global warming presents a wide range of strategies that need to be anticipated. At the consultation table of this work group — with representatives from industry, government, the environmental movement and science — the interests of the region in particular were paramount. And the interests are huge.\nThe region has traditionally provided high added value to the national economy. The cluster is the location of many international companies, it provides ample employment, it is innovative and it serves a sizeable hinterland. However, this high level of activity also means he area is energy-intensive, with the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions.\nt is therefore a major task to move from such a situation to one where making a sufficient contri bution to the climate objectives is possible. The process began by jointly identifying a number of themes on which ‘leaders’ could work. This laid the foundation for possible routes towards he future. During a pressure cooker session, this was worked out in greater detail with steam and boiling water.\nThis eventually resulted in a proposed three-step approach which, under the right conditions, could lead to the desired outcome both for the reduction target of 49% by 2030 and for the longer term. At the same time, the competitive position of Dutch industry needs to be main- tained.\nAs chairman, | have to say that with full commitment to the Rotterdam-Moerdijk industrial area, the work group has applied a professional process in order to make an important and realistic contribution to the outlines for a national climate agreement. And that the interests of the region can be upheld.\nA much heard motto in this area is ‘Make it Happen’. | think this is excellent advice we can now use fo get down to business; carefully, but resolutely and purposetully.\nAllard Castelein,\nChairman of the Rotterdam-Moerdijk Industry Cluster work group\nCOmposition of the work group\nErik van Beek\nExxonMobil\nProvince of South Holland CMS Eneco Solar, Bio & Hydro Port of Rotterdam Authority AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals nstitute for Sustainable Process Technology TenneT Deltalings Ministry of Economic Affairs & Climate Clingendael International Energy Programme Stedin AVR Air Liquide Benelux Greenpeace South Holland Nature and Environment Federation Dutch Research Institute for Transitions Province of North Brabant BP Europe/NL LyondellBasell Rotterdam City Government Shell\nAdri Bom-Lemstra, Wiebe Brandsma\nRobert Bosman\nHugo Buis, Wiertjan de Raaf\nAllard Castelein\nMarcel Galjee, Marco Waas\nTjeerd Jongsma\nMel Kroon, Gineke van Dijk, Arno Haverkamp\nSteven Lak, Alice Krekt\nWolter Leiseboer, Maxim Snippe\nCoby van der Linde\nMarc van der Linden, David Peters\nYves Luca, Michiel Timmerije\nFloris Mackor, Steve Sol\nFaiza Oulahsen\nAlex Ouwehand\nan Rotmans\nAnne-Marie Spierings, Loet Visschers\nan Teijema, Ruben Beens, Corné Boot\nWillemien Terpstra\nAdriaan Visser, Fred Akerboom\nos van Winsen, Marc Zwart\nThe Port of Rotterdam Authority provided general support from Caroline Kroes, Nico van Dooren, Ruud Melieste and Mark Dijk. In a separate consultation meeting organised by Deltalings in conjunction with the Port of Rotterdam Authority, the other companies in the RotterdamMoerdijk cluster were invited to make their contribution, and the results were tested.\nMandate for the Rotterdam-Moerdijk Industry Cluster work group The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate has commissioned the national Industrial Commission to develop a shared vision for reaching a sustainable industry and to make specific agreements for 2030, with a view to setting targets for 2050.\nThe ministry’s mandate to the five regional work groups went as follows: For each of their regions, these work groups are asked to identity possible measures and projects that will reduce CO» emissions, examine how costeffective these measures and projects are and find out what support there is for these measures and projects. The work groups are also asked to propose measures and projects that will jointly involve government authorities and businesses. They are also asked to examine potential cross- regional or company-specific measures along the value chain.\nSUMMARY\nThe RotterdamMoerdijk industry cluster can successfully make the required contribution to the national climate target for the reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030. Over the past few months the work group for the industry cluster has put together a package of measures and projects that could achieve up to almost 10 megatons of annual CO» reduction (scope 1) This is in keeping with the government's mandate and, more importantly, it outlines a realisti- cally promising perspective for a sustainable industry cluster in 2050.\nThe work group has drawn up a roadmap to 2050 that introduces farreaching innovation while at the same time gives existing industry in the region the time it needs to make adjust ments to its business processes. By doing so, the regional economy will be upheld, levels of mployment will be maintained and a new international competitiveness will be established for the future. This is closely in line with the government's wishes as to how the energy transi- tion should be shaped.\nThis report will explain the roadmap in greater detail. Following a period in which as much efficiency and optimisation as possible was introduced into the existing energy system, electrification and the use of hydrogen form the cornerstones of a new system for energy and raw materials. This allowed the work group fo maintain its focus on both the short and the long term. The latter was achieved, for instance, with the input of specialists and a sketch of the port industry area in 2050. This is included in this report.\nThe strength of the package of measures for 2030 is that technically speaking it can now be implemented. There is still a lot of work to be done, though, and financial mechanisms will need to help to balance business cases.\nThe report contains a set of clear conditions for success, most of which will have to be covered by government. For example, the industry's competitive international position must continue to be given adequate attention, and the risk of carbon leakage must not be unde- restimated. Furthermore, societal acceptance of the projects is of huge importance.\nFor the capture, transport and underground storage of CO>, a national industrial commission agreed to three-months of facHinding for reasons of due diligence. The knowledge acquired in connection with the Porthos project may be of service in this respect. For the development of CCS/CCUS, which the industrial commission in this region considers necessary, it is also important that innovations are sought over a longer period of time, both at company level and from a social perspective.\nThe government had also asked the work group to look at crossegional measures in the value chain. In particular, the work group has set these down in a list of enablers, which can be used to realise projects. For the RotterdamMoerdijk industry cluster, this especially concerns an expansion of the energy infrastructure, such as heat networks, COz transport and storage infrastructure, steam networks, increasing the capacity of the electricity grid for industrial electrification, and the expansion of the hydrogen network.\nThe latter would also require creating a sufficient supply of hydrogen. This means: scaling up electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen (mainly produced by offshore wind) and immediately expanding the supply of blue hydrogen (based on residual gases or natural gas, whereby the released CO, is stored at once).\nThe important thing here is that opting for electrification and hydrogen can be done indepen dently of the supply of solar power or wind energy and green hydrogen and other techno- logical innovations that have yet to be scaled up. This is to avoid unnecessary supply chain dependence when making investment decisions. However, any acceleration in the roll-out of offshore wind energy cannot be seen separately from the growth in industrial demand. The development of demand in the cluster may reduce the investment risks for offshore wind energy.\nFinally, it is important that emission reductions with electrification can be recorded as CO» reductions, even if new supply and demand do not (immediately) match. The supply of blue hydrogen can bridge the period of upscaling and availability of green hydrogen in a clima- teneutral way. Part of the necessary transition is intensifying supply chain cooperation and continued chemical recycling, especially in this region.\nWhat now? The chosen approach and the formulated framework conditions for success mean a sound basis now exists. In the summer, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency will weigh up impact and costs of the proposals put forward by all climate commit tees. It will then be important to hold discussions with local, regional and national social and public parties and build broad support so that progress can be made on the projects with a range of coalitions and custom-made solutions.\nPROMISING PROSPECTS\nVISION OF THE ROTTERDAM- MOERDIJK INDUSTRY CLUSTER IN 2050\nWorking towards climate targets without a clear picture of what the Rotterdam-Moerdijk industry cluster might actually look like in 2050 is a complex task.\nThis prompted the work group to produce a sketch of industry in the middle of the century. Not only as a promising perspective but also as a test of whether the outlines set out are enough to achieve a radical transition on the way to 2050 and to help readers of this report form an image of a potential future.\n2050\nIn 2050, industry in Rotterdam-Moerdijk presents a dynamic image. A high level of activity is prevailing and the port is still an important hub in the Northwest European market. New and transformed industries are flourishing in a newly designed energy and economic system. The fourth industrial revolution is in full swing.\nLike satellites, companies are linked to a smart infrastructure that forms the basis of a circular system. All companies are connected to it for the supply and input of electricity, hydrogen, esidual gases, steam, heat, CO» etc as a basis for new raw materials.\nConstruction of this infrastructure was started in good time. Whereas at the start of the ransition fossil fuel flows were mainly exchanged over this infrastructure, in 2050 this infrastructure is being fully utilised for the purpose of renewable flows.\nADDED VALUE OF INDUSTRY\nIn 2017 the added value to the Netherlands of the industry cluster came to almost €13 billion. By 2050 this added value, in relative terms, has only increased. This is mainly due to the fact that the characteristic infrastructure of Rotterdam-Moerdijk offers opportunities to companies that are not available elsewhere.\nThis has improved the international business climate. It has a positive impact on the overall mployment prospects for around 75,000 people who are active in the industry, producing an extremely wide range of products. The industry cluster supplies the building blocks for products that can be found everywhere in everyday life, such as in your home: the fibres for your carpets or the coating for your laminate floor, the insulation in your walls and refrige- rator, UPVC window frames, and the filling in your mattress and sofa.\nIn your car too: for instance, the dashboard, steering wheel and seats, and of course the fuel. There is the nylon in your clothing and in your toothbrush, your child’s plastic toys, the plastic bottles for your soft drinks, food packaging, the screen on your mobile phone, the soles of your shoes, the aromatics in your deodorant and perfume, and the solvents and binders in your paint. And many more daily consumer goods.\nThere are increasingly more specialised jobs. For this purpose, business, the government and educational institutions are committed to making the labour market and education more flexible.\nRotterdam-Moerdijk made a timely start in transitioning to a new system for energy and raw materials by 2050. Initially, the main focus was on the fossil fuel energy system: more ficiency, investments in cleaner finished products and the underground storage of CO». Sufficient scope for experimentation helped to discover and scale up new innovative paths in plenty of time. The synergy between, say, Brainport in Brabant and Mainport in Rotterdam led to an acceleration in the introduction of innovations into the market.\nThe desire to remain the architect of our own future led to sharp changes in the fields of energy, housing and work. In 2050 the combination of green electricity, hydrogen, biomass and waste forms the basis for the new energy and raw materials system in Rotterdam- Moerdijk and far beyond.\nCLEAR CHOICES\nThe push for a hydrogen economy came with the construction of blue hydrogen plants on he basis of natural gas and waste gases. The CO» released could be stored in empty gas ields. The necessary interim phase was followed up by the arrival of large-scale green hydrogen produced by water electrolysis using green electricity, mainly from wind farms on he North Sea. In 2050 this is done partly on energy islands off the coast.\nn the new energy system, sufficient heat is released to provide heating for homes, green- houses, offices and other companies. CoaHired power plants have disappeared. For unforeseen situations, flexible boilers that can run on Hydrogen and, in emergencies, on natural gas are kept in reserve at critical locations.\nCHEMICALS AND REFINING\nTimely anticipation of the opportunities offered by energy transition put the chemical industry in a leading position when it came to supplying growing markets for clean fuels and raw materials. This made it possible to capitalise on the strong international market position that had been built up over the past few decades.\nIn 2050, the chemical sector is flourishing, with hydrogen, waste, biomass etc providing the raw materials for circular processes. Besides providing the required heat, hydrogen also forms one of the sources for producing semi-finished and finished products. With over forty chemical companies in Rotterdam-Moerdijk, the size of the sector has remained virtually unchanged over the years. Companies run on hydrogen, circular carbons, biomass and secondary raw materials. A key example is the methanol production that uses waste, mainly for the chemical industry.\nIn Europe, the falling demand for fuels has led to farreaching integration of the chemical and refinery industries. The refinery sector may be smaller in size, but its role as a manufac- turer of chemical raw materials and fuels for export has grown.\nFurthermore, in 2050 the cluster is seeing a large scale conversion of synthetic raw material produced from renewabl nergy. This is providing the aviation and shipping industries with synthetic fuels. A 95% reduction (the climate target for 2050) has not made the industry wholly emissions free. There are still pockets that cannot be placed in the circular system. Accordingly, in 2050, the port industrial area has been allocated a limited amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowance. It also has a strict limit and should to a larg xtent be compensated by negative emissions, mainly through bio-based production in the chemical sector.\nRE-INVENTED\nHet haven-industriegebied Rotterdam-Moerdijk is daarmee in 2050 ingrijpend veranderd. In 2050, the port industrial area of Rotterdam-Moerdijk has therefore undergone radical changes. It runs on a new system of energy and raw materials and it has consolidated its interests and international role.\nBesides its new and renewed industry, the port complex fills a vital role in the international marketplace at this point of the mid-century. The Rotterdam-Moerdijk industrial area rein- vented itself in good time and has also managed to develop. Accordingly, in 2050, one of the greatest challenges of the century has been converted into a new future.\n—\nREDUCING CO.\nEMISSIONS\nTHE STEPS ON THE PATH TO ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE TARGETS FOR 2030 AND 2050\n1. THE CURRENT SYSTEM\nThe Rotterdam-Moerdijk port industrial area consists of around 60 companies, including five oil refineries, 36 chemical companies, four waste processing companies and 14 other industrial companies.\nThis industry cluster produces almost €13 billion of added value to the Netherlands and offers employment to some 75,000 people!. The region imports raw materials and produces and supplies products with an annual energy content of more than 2,000 petajoules (P)).\nApproximately 260 PJ are consumed in the production processes. Almost half of this energy input comes from the waste gases from the refineries, with an almost equal amount of natural gas coming from the gas network and an additional small amount of energy coming from general waste and electricity from the power grid.\nThis energy consumption produces 18.6 megatons (MT) of CO> emissions (2016). Since 2005, captured CO has been delivered to the greenhouse horticulture sector, and steam and heat networks have been operational for five years, allowing the reciprocal exchange of steam and the supply of residual heat to district heating networks.\n' Including industry-related transport and purchasing suppliers. among Source: Havenmonitor 2016 (Erasmus, Oct. 2017).\nROTTERDAM/MOERDIJK INDUSTRY CLUSTER IN 2016 ENERGY FLOWS\n15.9Mr\nCO>\nELECTRICITY\nGENERATION\n18.6wr\nCO>\nROTTERDAM/MOERDIJK\nINDUSTRY CLUSTER\nRAW MATERIALS\nAND PRODUCTS\nWIND\nBIOMASS\nCOAL\n9、 の\nや ん\nREFINING\neo\nBOILERS, FURNACES,\nHEATING PLANTS AND\nHYDROGEN FACTORIES\nOO\n120 PJ WASTE GASSES\nェ 1.900 PJ\nACGRIBULK\n& BIOMASS\nCHEMICALS\nA\n35 PJ HYDROGEN\n145 PJ STEAM\n26 PJ POWER\nぐ *>\nPJ\nPOWER\nSTATIONS\n中\nめ\nPOWER\nGGENERATION\nINDUSTRY\n山\nCHEMICAL\nPRODUCTS\n@\n28 PJ 6\nWASTE\nINCINERATORS\nぐ\nK >\nぐ\n《⑯\n190 PJ\n“ee\nPJ\nRESIDUAL\nHEAT\nの\n5.5\n-0.5 MT CO2\n6)\n0\nGAS NET 0\nPOWER\nGRID HEAT\ncowpawms\nで ) em\nャ\n人 人\nNET CO>-NET\nAt the beginning of 2016, there were eight power plants (four gas fired, four coal fired) with over 5 GW capacity in the port industrial area. The CO> emissions from these power plants was almost 16 Mt in 2016. Three of the plants (two coal and one gas) have since closed. Incidentally, the power plants are not included in the Rotterdam-Moerdijk industry cluster work group’s report, as discussions and measures in this area have been transferred to th national Electricity Commission.\nA continuing focus on energy efficiency is standard and is driven by the relatively higher energy costs in Rotterdam-Moerdijk compared to the United States and the Middle East. For many years industry has been working with government on energy efficiency as part of the LTA and LEE covenants. As a result, the industry cluster has kept the level of CO. emis- sions virtually stable since 2000, while several new world scale factories have been built. An additional energy efficiency mandate is currently being worked on as part of the 2013 Energy Agreement (9 P] nationally). Energy efficiency will remain a key pillar in the process of reducing CO> emissions. The focus is shifting from energy efficiency to a reduction in CO» emissions.\nFarreaching CO» reduction in the industry cluster is technically possible. However, it does entail radical changes to operational process that are often complex and expensive. The following issues are therefore of great importance to industry:\nLongterm agreements between government and the various companies in the region, so that after 2030 the follow-up steps can be taken based on the changes in processes that will be applied until 2030.\nThe availability of an energy infrastructure to which industry running CO2 emission reduction projects can connect.\nFinancial resources and/or guarantees to address unprofitable peaks. From the perspective of a level playing field, an adequate marketbased mechanism needs to be developed to make business cases possible.\n[he availability of enough green power and molecules, or being allowed to register invest ments as an emission reduction measure, even if there is still no supply of sufficient green power or molecules.\n[he ability to introduce measures into the maintenance/investment cycles, of which for most industries there will be no more than two until 2030.\n[he ability to introduce measures onto the site requires customisation. Some technologies (such as hybrid solutions) require space that is not always available. This means either examining a more radical solution right away or waiting for space to become available.\n2. TOWARDS CO,-REDUCTION IN THREE STEPS\nTechnically speaking, the climate targets set for 2030 and 2050 can be achieved in three steps. In order to enable industry to achieve the required CO» reductions, enablers are needed to help realise the projects. These three steps towards COy reduction? look like this:\nStep 1 - Efficiency, developing infrastructure and CCUS. In this phase, between 2018 and 2025, the focus will be on the supply and reuse of surplus energy and storage/use of captured CO).\nEnablers expand the energy infrastructure for heat, CO» and steam.\nProjects uncouple and connect to specific infrastructure projects that are under development, such as: South Holland Heat Alliance, EnergyWeb XL (residual heat in Moerdijk), Porthos (CCUS} and Botlek steam network\nCO, reduction potential 4.9 Mt of CO» reduction (scope 1) up to 2030. In addition, the supply of industrial residual heat and CO> can achieve a 2.6 to 3.5 Mt of CO» reduction in the built environment and greenhouse horticulture.\nStep 2 - Towards a new energy system. This phase (2020-2030) is mainly concerned with making energy use by industry sustainable.\nEnablers expand/increase capacity of the energy infrastructure for electricity and hydrogen; and market creation through a combined strategy of blue hydrogen (rollout) and green hydrogen (pilot & demonstration, roll-out).\nProjects electrification for LT/MT heat and hydrogen for HT heat. CO, reduction potential estimated to be 3 1/2 to 4 Mt by 2030.\nStep 3 - Renewal of raw materials and fuel system (2030-2050)\nEnablers large-scale supply of green electricity and green hydrogen, connected to th industry cluster, development of international recycling hub, biomass hub and hydrogen hub. Projecten VVaste-2-chemicals, Pyrolysisto-cracker, pyrolysisto-efinery, biobased chemicals. CO, reduction potential estimated to be 1 Mt by 2030.\n?

Although there are several steam pipes between companies, a lot more steam could be exchanged, offering a potential reduction in emissions of 0.5 Mt of CO» per year by 2030. This would require an xtensive and integrated steam network in the Botlek.\n®\nHeat delivery by industry can help reduce emissions by 2.1 Mt of COz per year in the built environment and greenhouse horticulture by 2030. Industry could make this possible if the parties supplying heat were also allowed to register part of the CO» emissions avoided to justify investments, or were compensated in some other way. There are specific business cases for the required heat infrastructure, such as those of the South Holland Heat Alliance and EnergyWeb XL.\n\nFor Carbon Capture, Usage & Storage (CCUS) an exploratory project was carried out by Port of Rotterdam Authority, Gasunie and Energie Beh t Nederland (EBN), under the name of Porthos Port of Rotterdam CO» Transport Hub & Offshore Storage}. The project involves the construction of a 33 km collection pipeline through the port, connection to the OCAP CO, network for supplying he greenhouse horticulture sector, and connection fo a new compression station on the Maasvlakte rom where the CO, will be transported along a newly laid 25 km long pipeline to a North Sea gas platform, where it will be injected into two gas reservoirs, 3 1/2 km beneath the seabed. Th potential for CO» reduction is 3.6 Mt per year by 2030, involving mainly relatively pure CO> flows rom factory processes. Besides being captured, the CO» could also be used in greenhouse horti- culture. At the moment, 0.5 Mt is already being supplied to the sector. The total market potential for CO» supply to greenhouse horticulture in South Holland and North Holland is estimated to be 2 Mt. Moreover, there is additional potential for CCUS if production of blue hydrogen were rolled out (see explanation of step 2). In addition, CCUS in Rotterdam could form a gateway for other industry clusters fo connect to the pipeline and supply captured COs (Zeeland, Chemelot). Finally, CCUS also offers an option for achieving negative emissions by storing shortcycle CO> from biomass. In the long term this could prove necessary, should climate change move more quickly than anticipated or energy transition take longer than imagined.\nEXPLANATION STEP 2\nMAKING ENERGY CONSUMPTION SUSTAINABLE: ELECTRIFICATION AND HYDROGEN\n@\nElectrification is, technically speaking, relatively straightforward in the following cases: . production of hot water (wet steam): heat pumps - production of steam for propulsion: electric motors (replacing condensing steam turbines] - production of saturated steam for process heat: electric boilers (replacing steam boilers, CHP) The replacement of steam turbines and steam boilers by electrical equipment can result in reduced reliability. Furthermore, using electric boilers is currently often only possible up to more limited capacities than the current capacities.\nElectrification is technically not straightforward when it comes to the production of superhe- ated steam and/or higher steam pressures, due to the high pressure and temperature of th steam. It also requires a great deal of electrical capacity (MVV) and additional space. Electrification is technically complex when it comes to the production of heat in process furnaces due to the extremely high temperatures.\nFor heat pumps a reduction potential of 0.5 Mt of CO, by 2030 is estimated, for electric motors and electric boilers around 2 Mt of CO» by 2030. Sufficient green electricity (offshore wind] will have to be brought to the region to be able to utilise this electrification potential: approximately 12 TWh in 2030, corresponding to approximately 3 GW of offshore wind power. This will require strengthening of both the grid and, where necessary, connections and internal company networks. It will also require close cooperation and coordination of projects between industry and the grid operators.\n0\nHydrogen For the production of process heat, hydrogen may be an alternative where electrifica- tion is not straightforward or complex: in the production of superheated steam and the production of heat in process furnaces. This is mainly the case with refineries and chemical crackers. At the current state of the art of green hydrogen production using electrolysis, it is not opportune for the industry to develop this sustainability option before 2030, although research, pilots and expansion will certainly be backed. The step towards hydrogen could be different if industry were able to make use of blue hydrogen: hydrogen produced from natural gas or residual gases, where the CO, released is stored underground or reused in greenhouse horticulture.\n—\n13\nFor the time being, the CO» avoidance costs of this option are still considerably lower than with green hydrogen.\nOne possible route is therefore for the Rotterdam-Moerdijk industry cluster to opt for a combined strategy involving blue and green hydrogen: Roll out blue hydrogen (+CCUS) one possible route is therefore for the Rotterdam-\nMoerdijk industry cluster to opt for a combined strategy involving blue and green hydrogen:\nRoll out blue hydrogen (+CCUS) for the rapid creation of a larger hydrogen market, enabling industry to make an early choice regarding new fuel and/or technology, rather than having to wait for the green hydrogen market to come of age.\nGreen Hydrogen pilot and demonstration (electrolysis of 20 MVV to 100 MW plus in the port] so that the then increased market for hydrogen can switch to green hydrogen alter 2030\nCommit to pilots for energy storage and conversion\nThanks to this combination strategy of market creation and sustainability, a possible mismatch between supply and demand is avoided: industry can adapt to hydrogen during its maintenance and investment cycles at the sites without having to take the pace of wind farm construction and electrolysis development into account.\nBy producing blue hydrogen, the industry also retains an outlet for waste gases from the refining process, which are currently used to replace natural gas and for which there is no alternative.\nMarket creation for hydrogen also facilitates the introduction of green hydrogen because more users are expanding the current specific user market. By creating a larger market, it may also be possible to move along the learning curve more quickly and reduce the cost of use — unlike in current applications (comparable to the development of LNG, not only or generating electricity but also for mobility).\nDepending on how fast we can scale up the supply of green hydrogen, which currently has relatively high CO> avoidance costs, 1 or 2 new hydrogen factories could be built by 2030. These could each contribute around 0.7 Mt of CO to the CCUS project on op of the base case (3.6 Mt) of Porthos.\nn addition, a scaling up of the regional hydrogen network will then be needed. Hydrogen can be used first of all for the production of high temperature heat and later for he production of sustainable raw materials as well (see step 3).\nIn addition, hydrogen can also be used for mobility and can be blended with the natural gas network.\nSupplying blue and later green hydrogen to other industrial clusters is also an option (e.g for ammonia production in Zeeland and Chemelot). There are proposals for linking the various clusters in the Netherlands (and perhaps also the ones in Germany and Belgium) by converting natural gas networks into hydrogen networks or by laying a new hydrogen network.\nDeveloping energy storage and conversion techniques could yield a great deal of know- ledge and expertise, which would allow us fo make the chemical industry in particular more sustainable after 2030.\nFurthermore, research needs to be carried out in cooperation with the network operators to determine the best location for a new hydrogen factory, either centralised in the port or decentralised for larger customers. The location of green hydrogen production also requires coordination in connection with synergy benefits arising from the use of oxygen and residual heat released during the electrolysis of water.\nAtter 2030, hydrogen production at sea will also come into play. It will either be gene- rated directly in turbines or with electrolysers on an island or platform before being piped ashore. The import of hydrogen by sea will also be an option if solar farms in overseas areas continue to scale up and the transport of hydrogen by ship to large markets becomes increasingly attractive.\nThe construction of import and storage facilities would then become opportune after 2030. The import of blue hydrogen would also be possible, as would green hydrogen from other world markets. In the longer term, blue hydrogen capacity, together with hydrogen imports (solar and wind from elsewhere), could be used to balance supply and demand (and supply security).\n14\nEXPLANATION STEP 3\nMAKING RAVV MATERIAL USE SUSTAINABLE: HYDROGEN AND CARBON\noO\nHydrogen: Some time after 2030, as soon as green electricity can be offered on a larger scale and there is enough electrolysis, raw materials and fuels for greening will also come into play along this route: powerto-chemicals, poweroliquids and synfuels. Consequently, the demand from Rotterdam-Moerdijk for green electricity for raw materials and energy alone could grow to 50 TWh in 2050%. Then there is the fuel market as well. In addition to the large scale of offshore wind power in the North Sea, this also requires a great deal of import, also for any market demand from other clusters and neighbouring countries, which can be connected to the RotterdamMoerdijk system.\nO\nCarbon: Besides being a hub for electricity and hydrogen, the port is an import hub for secondary raw materials (waste & plastics) and sustainable biomass. After all, in addition to hydrogen, carbon is also need to make products. The port mainly needs to focus on concen- trated, large, circular carbon sources:\nSOLID WASTE\n©\nMechanical recycling: is the most environmentally and cost efficient way of converting plas- tics so they can be properly recycled. Due to the growing demand for high-quality recyclate for new plastics, there is a need for further expansion, scaling up and professionalisation of the recycling capacity in Europe. The presence of primary plastics manufacturers and the large supply of waste and sorted flows make Rijnmond an interesting location for high-quality mechanical recycling.\n®\nChemical recycling: In addition to mechanical recycling, chemical recycling technologies offer the opportunity of converting non-recyclable plastic waste into products such as polymers, monomers, fuels, waxes, aromatics or synthetic gases.\nGassification: The first project in this area is a new gasification plant at Enerkem, which can process some plastic fractions and produce methanol for the chemical industry. The plant can process 360 ktons of waste into 220 ktons of green methanol, which can achieve a CO» reduction of approx. 300 kton. If this technology can be successfully expanded, there could be four such factories there in the long term. Rotterdam could then be developed into a recycling hub for national and international general waste.\nPyrolysis: In Rotterdam there is an ongoing initiative for an integrated pyrolysis cluster that includes various pyrolysis initiatives that can produce naphtha fractions to be processed as coteed in the existing naphtha crackers or pyrolysis oil for upgrading in existing oil refine ries. Companies, the government and educational institutions in the pyrolysis testing ground in the southern part of the Netherlands are also exploring the possibilities of processing waste streams using pyrolysis technology in Moerdijk.\nBIOMASS\n©\nRotterdam-Moerdijk is already one of the largest biobased clusters in the world. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of opportunities to further strengthen this position: Cascading wood as much as possible: first extract sugars and then gasify the rest for chemistry or burn it for energy Biobased (sugar & photosynthesis) solutions such as top up ‘(Sugars on Top)’ for high-quality products, usually in lower volumes.\nWith the greening of raw materials and products, CO reductions can be achieved elsewhere in the production chain outside the Netherlands (for example, if with Waste-2- Chemicals, methanol or other basic chemicals that are currently imported can be produced in the Netherlands).\n3 Source: Decarbonisation Pathways for the Industrial Cluster of the Port of Rotterdam,\nWuppertal Institute, October 2016.\n15\nPROVISIONAL ABATEMENT CURVE PROJECTS UP TO 2030\nThe figure below gives an indication of the cost range of avoided CO» and the amount of CO, that is involved in the projects in the region up to 2030.

However, the implementation of these measures is economically unviable, and it will be necessary to develop a mechanism with the right framework conditions so that the projects can be carried out. We agree with the framework conditions set out in the working document of the Industrial Commission*, with the following fragment taken from the report of the National Industry Commission for Climate Agreement. When developing measures, we would therefore request:\nLong-term stable investment climate and multi-annual stable legislation and regula- tions: with the focus on continuing and strengthening the various industrial clusters in the Netherlands. In addition, legislation will need to be changed, for instance in the area of improving the feasibility of rules surrounding energy efficiency and the network codes required for direct current networks. Solution to the OPEX problem®: the price difference between natural gas/fossil fuel and sustainable energy sources and (too low) ETS prices. An additional CO2 price in (NVV] Europe could be an option, provided it applies to all companies and there is no ‘leakage’ (or compensation is made for leakage; but there are numerous other options that also need to bi xamined). Incidentally, this would not work for the natural gas carbon atoms that are used as a raw material. Funding structures, where the risk of an insufficiently level international (at least European) playing field and an ETS price that does not rise quickly enough are partially funded by governments? (e.g. InvestNL, EIB or guarantee schemes). These may include new public-private partnerships between network companies and government, in which infra- structure is built as a catalyst for the transition. Investments in renewable energy and critical infrastructures and control of infrastructure (including the reuse of former (gas) infrastructure) at national level based on a national structural concept and regional coordination by provinces and local authorities. A timely and sufficient supply of affordable green electricity is needed. A change to international/national rules around CO, accounting focused on the circular economy, among other things. Agreements on CO> accounting of cross-border projects, shipping and aviation, and elaboration of international chain effects (e.g. CCU, green and circular feedstock). Amend ETS rules for transport (other than via pipelines) and storage of materials (plastics).\n4 https: // www.klimaatakkoord.nl/industrie/documenten/publicaties/20 18/07/10/bijdrage-industrie\n5 In addition to this specific problem regarding the difference in prices, the profitability of the CAPEX is also at stake. energy © It is also important to take marketbased funding conditions into account.\n20\nA change to (international) waste and chemical legislation and waste transport legislation aimed at optimum value creation of waste substances so that either the conversion from waste to raw material is conducted more quickly or waste is never classified as waste. In addition, the development of a targeted import strategy for waste and secondary raw materials so that there is enough supply of biobased and waste-based raw materials for industry. Programme-based coordination and cooperation between network companies and government bodies {including knowledge institutions in the case of innovation) aimed at building new value chains and sustainable partnerships” where the Netherlands can play a distinctive role, and carrying out projects and measures that allow permit procedures to run smoothly enough. Speed and flexibility of granting permits partly determine the pace of transition. Take account of the whole energy system. The measures for industry have such a wide impact on energy supply that an integrated approach is needed; one that fosters synergy in the reduction of COs in other sectors (electricity, built environment). 9 Enough highly-educated staff with the right qualifications (training programme/National Technology Pact). 10. Speed up (mission-driven) innovation programmes, demonstrations and pilots® so the industrial transition can be expanded and accelerated on a large scale and simultane- ously in many places. This will require enough scope for experimentation. 11. Joint communication and an area-based approach by the Climate Agreement partners regarding the usefulness and necessity of industrial transition, its impact on our future pros perity and the way in which (global) consumption is the ultimate key to a more sustainable society. Due to the local impact of measures in the regions, the role of industry within its surroundings is of major importance.\nNB: SCOPE FOR GROWTH\nSince the transition will ideally be paid for by increasing prosperity and the Netherlands needs to remain attractive for the required investments, it is important to draw up agreements that allow for the growth of industry within the principles of the emissions caps. The investment in new production units often precedes the disposal of obsolete ones, and that requires reaching oneto-one deals with existing industry cove ring the temporary easing of emission limits (assuming a ‘normal weather year’) based on an agreed reduction schedule.\nIn addition, new investments may increase absolute CO, emissions, whereas CO? emissions per product may decrease. Arrangements within the Climate Agreement should support such developments rather than slow them down. This type of invest ment can also lead to a consolidation of industry in the most energy-efficient clusters. Measures that will require temporarily higher CO emissions in industry but which, on balance, turn out to be more favourable in scopes 2 and 3 are also conceivable. It is necessary to determine in advance which framework conditions apply to the new entrants, who may affect the course of the transition. Scope for this has been created in the ETS system; perhaps something similar can also be included in the Dutch agreements.\nOn all these points, it is important that industry is encouraged to take the measures in scope 2 (more sustainable energy supply and energy savings) and scope 3 (residual heat, climate-neutral raw materials). In some cases, this will require financial support.\n7 In recent PPP links have disappeared; really need them again years, we now.\n8 Knowledge and Innovation Agenda (H8), which the Dutch government's innovation budgets based.\non\nare\n21\nerror"

In order to deliver the required benefits for the chemical industry, the following key principles should apply:\nPerc\nDiscussion Paper\nMarch 2020\n1. Export competitiveness must be ensured\nThe European chemical industry is an export champion. It currently exports around 30% of its production outside Europe, making the EU the biggest chemicals exporting region in the world with a €45bn trade surplus for chemical products. Any new system should reinforce Europe’s strength in the EU chemicals industry as well as its downstream value chains.\n2. WTO compatibility must be ensured\nAny system must be WTO compatible and therefore consider the non-discriminatory, differentiation and “likeness” principles of the WTO as well as possible allowed exceptions under Article XX. Furthermore, any system should be in line with and support the Paris Agreement.\n3. Promote international dialogue to avoid trade conflicts\nThe EU will remain open to and depend upon international free and fair trade and will have to engage in dialogue with its trading partners in order to avoid trade conflicts affecting non-concerned sectors. This dialogue in the context of the Paris Agreement or bilateral trade agreements could also promote the setting up of a global carbon pricing mechanism. Using trade agreements in this regard could be an option, as long as provisions incentivise trading partners to adopt ambitious climate objectives or obligations.\n4. Use revenues completely to support low carbon manufacturing and investment\nRevenues resulting from new measures should be entirely used to level the global playing field between competing industries* as well as for low carbon investment and industrial manufacturing transformation.\n5. Current carbon leakage safeguard must not be compromised\nThe ETS, with its free allocation principle and established framework until 2030, is an appropriate climate tool for mitigating domestic GHG emissions of the EU industry. However, the shrinking free allocation until 2030 will increase the exposure to competition from third countries that do not face similar, increased CO2 costs, thus un-levelling the playing field. Any future measures therefore would need to be complementary to the ETS free allocation system, so as to effectively cover carbon leakage risks at least in a comparable or better manner as the current free allocation system in the EU ETS, including the compensation of indirect emissions costs. Any system should ensure reliable and predictable conditions essential for technology-neutral investment decisions.\n6. Cost and complexity must be minimised, while the framework must be robust\nAny chosen option should not unnecessarily increase compliance costs or add administrative burden for the EU chemical industry as well as authorities. Still, robust monitoring, reporting and verification will need to be established ensuring legal certainty and equal treatment of international competitors.\nConcluding remarks\nWhile contributing to this consultation we are very aware we are experiencing unprecedented times, with events none of us have lived through before. Cefic endeavours to maintain a high standard in our responses to public consultations. While we are confident that this contribution adequately reflects\n1 Taxation import side should compensation export side: For sectors exporting goods from Europe on mean on to other regions, EU carbon costs that not incurred in competing regions would have to be compensated.\nBceric\nDiscussion Paper\nMarch 2020\nour views at the current time, we recognise that public and private sector responses to the crisis and its aftermath, both in the EU and globally, have the potential to significantly affect industry’s operating conditions. When investing in the future, industry, governments and institutions will also have to continue to ensure investments align with the policy targets of a climate-neutral Europe. We look to the European Commission to undertake the appropriate assessments and to include these wider considerations in the future framework that will be developed, with the objective of ensuring the EU’s post-crisis attractiveness as a place for investing in the industrial transformation required to achieve the objectives of the EU Green Deal."

We begin by explaining non-ferrous metals electro-intensive nature and our highest exposure to carbon leakage as a result of the indirect carbon costs of the EU ETS. We then proceed to comment on; 1) the type of policy instrument, 2) methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products and 3) sector scope. In commenting on the sector scope, we show how given our electro-intensive nature and price-taker market status, non-ferrous metals are one of, if not the most, exposed sector to carbon and investment leakage. Upfront we state the clear position of Eurometaux, that we believe that adequate indirect costs compensation scheme, not a CBAM, is the optimal wa to protect the most electro-intensive industries from carbon leakage in Phase IV of the EU ETS\". Giving the expected higher climate ambition for 2030, we fully agree that additional and improved carbon leakage provisions are essential. However, for electro-intensives we believe that alternative measures to a CBAM should be investigated and considered by the Commission in its upcoming impact assessment.\nSummary of Eurometaux Position on CBAM\ne\nThe non-ferrous metals industry fully supports the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). A fully functioning EU ETS is one which provides adequate protection against carbon leakage. As Europe’s most electro-intensive industry, we believe that an improved indirect costs compensation system is the optimal instrument to protect electro- intensive industries from carbon leakage. We thus call on policymakers to prioritise an improved indirect compensation scheme for Phase IV of the EU ETS. We believe this should be the first measure before possible secondary actions, such as CBAM, are considered.\nHowever, if such a measure is to be extended to electro-intensives, the following would need to be considered:\nNot undermine existing carbon leakage measures: /fa CBAM is to be introduced and cover electro-intensive industries, it should not undermine or replace the existing carbon leakage measures, most notably; indirect costs compensation and EU ETS free allowances. These mechanisms should remain in place, be prioritised and improved. We note however that the inception impact assessment says that a CBAM would be an “alternative” to existing carbon leakage provisions. These existing carbon leakage provisions have been effective in limiting carbon leakage to a certain degree (Not fully however), and therefore rather than replacing these existing measures (which could lead to catastrophic consequences for energy-intensive industries in Europe) priority should be to improve these measures. In particular, the ETS State Aid Guidelines for indirects compensation should be improved to adequately protect the most exposed.\n—\nThe challenge and complexity of indirect carbon costs: /f the CBAM also covers the carbon content for indirect emissions in the imported product, then it must also reflect the additional indirect costs European producers face compared to other global producers, in order to ensure a level playing field on the global level (due to marginal pricing in European power markets, indirect costs are not directly correlated to indirect emissions, as explained in this paper). If it is not possible for a CBAM to reflect indirect costs (and not just indirect emissions), then this would not ensure adequate protection against the threat of carbon leakage and indirect costs compensation would have to be kept alongside the CBAM. The two can co-exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. Indeed, for the primary production of non-ferrous metals such as zinc and aluminium, indirect carbon costs can be 20 to 7 times greater than directs.\n1\nUnder EU State Aid Rules, to address carbon leakage of electro-intensive industries, Member States can give compensation to certain sectors for the increases in electricity prices as a result of the indirect costs of the EU ETS. These Guidelines — often referred to as ‘the ETS State Aid Guidelines’ are currently being reviewed. New Guidelines expected to be established later in 2020 and will set the rules throughout Phase IV up to 2030.\neV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: AT THE HEART OF EUROPE\nee TtaiiGV.|§“‘\\0]0/\n1 April 2020\n=\nA detailed impact assessment is needed to understand the specificities of sectoral value chains: If introducing a CBAM for non-ferrous metals, policymakers should carefully assess the specificities of the non- ferrous metals value chain. Non-ferrous metals value chains are often very different, and more complex, compared to other sectors considered for a CBAM measure such as steel and cement.\nCover the entire value chain: If introducing a CBAM for non-ferrous metals, policymakers will have to cover the entire non-ferrous metals value chain. More specifically, this refers to upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product which contains the metal. It is clear that poorly designed schemes can be easily circumvented with the resulting impact undermining rather that increasing our industry’s competitiveness throughout the value chain, as well as increasing costs across the entire supply chain. Within this context, we are aware that there will be a trade-off between administrative burden and effectiveness of the measure. A balanced compromise position will need to be found between these two trade-offs.\nCBAM: Objectives and Policy Options\n1. Type of Policy Instrument\nThe list of options mentioned in the IIA include:\nI A carbon tax on selected products — both imported and domestic products ii. A new carbon customs duty on tax or imports iii. Extension of the EU ETS to imports\nWith regards the following options listed, each comes with advantages and disadvantages which will need a detailed impact assessment before any decisions are taken. With each of these measures, policymakers will also need to consider if they are i) WTO compliant, ii) integrate a lifecycle approach and iii) how they interaction with the existing carbon leakage provisions.\nWTO compatibility\nWe agree with the comment in the IIA that any potential system would need to be WTO compliant. There remains a concern that the introduction of a CBAM would most probably trigger an avalanche of WTO complains against the EU by third countries. If the EU lost such disputes, what would follow would either be the EU introducing changes to its CBAM (which would create great business uncertainty) or WTO authorised tariffs against the EU. These details must be taken into account in the Commission’s upcoming impact assessment work. Similarly, it needs to be factored in that even if the CBAM is fully WTO compliant, other major economies may still decide to implement retaliatory measures against European exports. These likely retaliatory measures should be fully assessed before implementing a CBAM.\nIntegrating a life cycle approach\nNon-ferrous metal value chains are very complex. As far as the carbon border adjustment mechanism will be applied to imported products it has to ensure that the carbon footprint of every product and associated cost are determined accurately.\nThe EU ETS benchmarks has been developed for industrial processes. In our view this approach will have limitations to be used for tradable products at the border because:\nIt covers the emissions of only part of the value chain: For example, processes for production of liquid metal. It excludes upstream activities for material acquisition as well as downstream activities for processing and\n-\n\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\nEV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: AT THE HEART OF EUROPE\nee TtaiiGV.|§“‘\\0]0/\n1 April 2020\ntransformation of the metal such as casting, rolling, extrusion, etc down to a final product. It also excludes transport activities. - It is based on the average performance of the 10 % most efficient installations in a sector or sub-sector, and does not reflect the actual carbon footprint of a product\nThis simplified approach not taking the whole value chain into account may create distortions and wrong incentives. In this context it is most accurate to use methodology that measures the carbon footprint of a product throughout its life cycle and consider the impacts of all steps needed to get the product on the market. There are accepted metrics to measure the carbon footprint of products such as the EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) which could be considered.\nThe methodology in any case need to ensure detailed requirements for calculating the carbon emissions and costs associated with a product throughout its life cycle, use of robust data, and verification of the correctness of the data.\nInteraction of the chosen policy instrument with existing carbon leakage provisions\nNon-ferrous metals production is extremely electro-intensive and is therefore more exposed to indirect than direct CO2 costs?. Indeed, electricity represents 35-45% of the cost of the primary production for many metals. For example, for primary aluminium, indirect costs are 6-7 times higher than direct costs. Thus, if the scope of a CBAM were to include electro-intensive sectors such as non-ferrous metals, indirect compensation would need to be maintained to mitigate indirect carbon costs. Further details on the challenges and complexities to compensate for the indirect costs of the EU ETS are given below in Annex i. Here we explain how indirect costs and indirect emissions are not directly correlated and If a CBAM is incapable of creating a level playing field with regards indirect costs (Which we see as highly doubtful given the massive difference in the design and functioning of power markets in third countries) then it will not be an effective instrument against carbon leakage for electro-intensive industries.\nThe IIA notes that a CBAM would be an ‘alternative’ to this existing carbon leakage measures. At this stage, it is important to highlight the major concern of non-ferrous metals producers that such measures would come as a replacement to the current carbon leakage measures. Such measures, while not yet fully adequate, nevertheless play an integral role in limiting the distortion between EU and non-EU producers. Given this, we believe it is fundamental that any border\nadjustment mechanism, does not reduce or replace the current carbon leakage protection mechanisms, in particular the indirect costs compensation, at least until it has been proven that the CBAM can offer a better level of protection.\n2. Methodological Approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products\nThe IIA notes that “under the EU ETS, a system of harmonised EU benchmarks has been developed for industrial processes”. It adds that if a sector is covered by the EU ETS, a CBAM could be based on similar methodological considerations as for the EU ETS, i.e. benchmark values, unless the exporter certifies a lower carbon content and/or a higher cost of origin. It adds that the Commission will also look at alternative approaches, e.g. defining carbon content of products, considering their interaction with existing and future climate policies.\n2 This is different other such steel who being assessed for this These carbon intensive and thus, very to sectors as or cement are measure. sectors are very are more exposed to carbon leakage based on the direct costs of the EU ETS. Non-ferrous metal producers are more electro-intensive and thus, more exposed to carbon leakage as a result of the indirect costs of the EU ETS. This also leads to numerous complications with regards how CBAM could effectively be implemented on imports of non-ferrous metals products.\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\nEV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: AT THE HEART OF EUROPE\nee TtaiiGV.|§“‘\\0]0/\n1 April 2020\nWe agree that we need a legitimate system for disclosing the carbon content of each product. At present, there is no common system for disclosing the carbon content of imported products. Such a system would also have to prevent third- country exporters from bypassing or gaming it. To take one example from primary aluminium production; 90% of Chinese primary aluminium production is based on coal-fired electricity generation, whereas the remaining 10% is based on hydropower’. Therefore, without a robust disclosure system, a Chinese exporter could simply declare that its aluminium was produced using hydropower (even if this isn’t true), in order to bypass the CBAM. Third countries would be incentivized to re-route all their ‘cleaner’ production to Europe (displacing European production), while continuing to cover demand across the rest of the world using carbon-intensive production. This would actually lead to an increase in global emissions, i.e. carbon leakage.\nWe also do not know either where carbon footprint in CBAM would be assessed at a Member State or installation level. This will need to be fully clarified to policymakers.\nWith regards non-ferrous metals, a CBAM system would need the following:\nI Details of where the primary metal of the product is producers in order to assess accurately the carbon footprint in primary production ii. Details on the metal content in the product iii. A system to compare direct and indirect emissions across countries or installations\nScope of CBAM: A CBAM should focus on emissions in both the primary production process and across the value chain\nOne area where the IIA does not give details is how much of the value chain the measures should cover. We believe that if introduced for electro-intensive industries, a CBAM should cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from primary product down to the final product containing the commodity.\nFor many non-ferrous metals producers, the electrolysis process is where there are large differences the CO2 emissions pattern, due to differences in indirect emissions (a result of the CO2 content of the electricity consumed). Other parts of the value chain have much less variation in emissions.\nHowever, it is important to consider that a CBAM system would only work effectively if the system encompassed products from the primary production down to final product containing the commodity. If this is not the case, our customers would have an incentive to move production out of Europe. In addition, going down through the value chain, customers of our customers could source components directly from abroad, hence importing them “CBAM free” and threatening the survival of upstream producers in the EU and EEA, while also leading to a very large increase in global emissions (i.e. carbon leakage).\nTo give an example, if only primary aluminium were covered by a CBAM, road wheel producers would move production out of Europe or they would become uncompetitive and European original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would source finished aluminium road wheels from abroad (which would be CBAM free, regardless of whether aluminium with a high carbon footprint has been used for their production).\n3. Sectoral Scope\nThe inception impact notes that it still needs to be decided which sectors should be included in the measure. It says that a scoping will be undertaken to ensure that the “measure applies where the risk of carbon leakage is the highest”. In the following section, we outline how the non-ferrous metals sector is one of, if not the, most exposed sector to carbon leakage. Despite this, as already stated, we believe that an improved and adequate indirects compensation scheme is the optimal way to protect electro-intensive industry from carbon leakage.\n3 http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminium-smelting-power-consumption/\n[at] [ce] [| [ee] [ze] [ax] [ae] [ee] [32] [ee] [52] [ee] fe] Lu] [| [eel fee [as] [ee [oe] [| [22] [eel [el [22] Lee] lv\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\neV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: AT THE HEART OF EUROPE\nee TtaiiGV.|§“‘\\0]0/\n1 April 2020\nHigher Ambition Scenario for 2030: Need for Reciprocal Carbon Leakage Measures\nCarbon Leakage Exposure of the Non-Ferrous Metals Sector\nIn the section ‘problem the initiative aims to tackle’ it notes that “carbon leakage occurs when production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or when EU products are replaced by more carbon intensive imports”. Given how electrified our processes are and that our sector's products are traded on global commodity exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) and/or other global pricing mechanisms, it is clear that the non-ferrous metals sector is the most exposed sector to carbon leakage as a result of the indirect costs of the EU ETS.\nIt should be noted that more than any other energy intensive sectors, carbon and investment leakage is a phenomenon which has already occurred in the non-ferrous metals sector. Indeed, since 2008, the EU has lost 36% of its primary aluminium smelting capacity (due to plant closures and curtailments). In these cases, European production being replaced by more CO2 intensive imports with investments being redirected to non-EU areas. Demand is being met by increased imports with EU production declining. For this reason, we disagree with the sentence that “the risk of carbon leakage has been effectively addressed” stated in the IIA.\nNeed for reciprocal carbon leakage measures\nThe IIA notes “the starting point for this exercise will be the new baseline scenario of the European Green Deal and its higher ambition for 2030”. We agree that if policymakers do choose to raise the 2030 targets, this needs to be accompanied by reciprocal carbon leakage measures to protect best performing installations from undue carbon costs. We believe that an adequate indirect costs compensation scheme - and not a mooted carbon border adjustment mechanism - is the optimal way to protect the most electro-intensive industries from carbon leakage.\nIn addition, the Commission should consider additional carbon leakage measures for electro-intensive industries. We believe the upcoming impact assessment should analyse not just CBAM but also consider additional carbon leakage measures which would be better suited for electro-intensive industries.\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\neV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: AT THE HEART OF EUROPE\nee TtaiiGV.|§“‘\\0]0/\n1 April 2020\nAnnex\n|\nApplying a CBAM to cover Indirect Emission Costs: Complexities of applying the measure to scope 2 emissions\nThe\nIt is unclear how a CBAM could be applied to sectors characterised by high levels of electrification (i.e. non-ferrous metals producers). While it may be possible to estimate the scope 1 (direct) emissions that are directly attributable to an imported product with a reasonable degree of accuracy, it is unclear how the scope 2 (indirect) footprint could be estimated. In undertaking such an assessment, policymakers would need to take into consideration the carbon content of the electricity consumed but also the carbon cost as indirect costs and indirect emissions are not directly correlated.\nIndeed, when seeking to address the indirect carbon costs challenge, it is essential to fully take into account the complexities of electricity market dynamics and that compensation needs to be based on the CO2 cost which European producers face, not the physical CO2 emission. Indeed, indirect CO2 costs depend on the specific price setting mechanism in the European power market (And not a result of the physical fuel mix).\nThus, in order to effectively guard against the threat of carbon leakage, indirect carbon costs are far more important than indirect carbon emissions attributable to the imported product. This is because as aforementioned, indirect costs and indirect emissions are not directly correlated due to marginal pricing in European power markets. Electricity prices are set by a marginal unit, which tends to be a thermal power plant which faces significant carbon costs. Therefore, all electricity prices in Europe (With the exception of Iceland) contain an implicit carbon costs (As set by the marginal unit), regardless of the actual carbon footprint of the consumed electricity.\nTo give an example, while Norway and the Nordic electricity market, has an almost 100% renewable based electricity, due to European electricity market dynamics (the so called ‘marginal price setting mechanism’), Nordic aluminium, silicon, copper, zinc and nickel producers still face a price effect of CO2 on electricity of 0.67. In practice, this means that every time the carbon price increases by €1/tCO2, the power price will increase by €0.67/MWh.\nThus, a CBAM based on the indirect emissions attributable to an imported product would not be capable of effectively guarding against carbon leakage, which is the result of indirect costs rather than indirect emissions. If a CBAM is incapable of creating a level playing field with regards indirect costs (Which we see as highly doubtful given the massive difference in the design and functioning of power markets in third countries) then it will not be an effective instrument against carbon leakage for electro-intensive industries.\nIl. Higher carbon footprint of International Competitors\nGiven the electro-intensive nature of non-ferrous metals production, what differentiates the carbon footprint in non-ferrous production globally is the indirect emissions (carbon content in the electricity consumed).\nEuropean production being replaced by more CO2 intensive Chinese production\nIn particular, EU non-ferrous metals production is being replaced with increased Chinese production, which, due to its largely coal based electricity mix, carries a much higher CO2 footprint*. To take the example of aluminium production, Chinese production has multiplied tenfold in 20 years and currently represents almost 60% of global production. A similar\n4\nFor more information, please see of the ‘Metals for a Climate Neutral Europe’ report page 26 ‘Box 2: China’s market dominance’: h tt tps://www.ies.be/files/Metals_for_a_ Climate Neutral Europe 0.pd f\nwoeniee\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\neV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: AT THE HEART OF EUROPE\nee TtaiiGV.|§“‘\\0]0/\n1 April 2020\nsituation can be viewed for other non-ferrous metal sectors. For example, Silicon production in China has exponentially increased in the last years. Today China is providing twice the world demand and has huge overcapacities.\nIt is very important to factor in that the carbon footprint for European producers is much lower than our international competitors, especially China. This is due, energy efficiency improvements in recent years and the EU’s less carbon intensive electricity mix vis-a-vis our international competitors. To give some concrete figures;\nv In aluminium, the European primary production has among the lowest carbon footprints in the world, amounting to about 7 tCO2/tAl, which is about one third of the respective Chinese footprint and less than half of the global 5 average v In Nickel, one tonnes of nickel in Europe is roughly 9 tonnes of CO2. In China, it is 70tonnes of CO2. This is 7.6 6 times more CO2 intensive v In Silicon, one tonne of silicon made in Europe is 3.4 tonnes of CO2. In China, itis 11.6 tonnes. Chinese production CO2 7 is 3.4 times more intensive\nIll. Non-Ferrous Metals — A Price Taker Sector competing against subsidised Chinese production\nElsewhere, it should be noted that the entire NFM industry is a price taker sector. Our sector is characterised by high price elasticity, global price setting; homogeneous product and low transportation cost. This means that we have no ability to pass through carbon costs to our customers and thus, are price-takers.\nPrice-taker are sectors whose products are demonstrably incapable of passing on regulatory costs such as indirect EU ETS costs. These sector's products are traded on global commodity exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) and/or other global pricing mechanisms. As a result of our sector’s price-taker characteristics and globally traded commodity price, any additional load (i.e. ETS costs) cannot be passed on and makes us uncompetitive vis-a-vis non EU+EEA producers.\nThere is strong evidence for major state-aid interventions and support in metals production outside of the EU, in particular in China. As an example, a recent OECD report concluded that 85% of subsidies in the aluminium sector went to 5 Chinese companies8. Such actions have resulted in excess capacities in China for aluminium, silicon and several other metals - at the same time as European production has stalled (e.g. over 30% of Europe’s primary aluminium production capacity has been idled since 2008).\nABOUT EUROMETAUX\nEurometaux is the decisive voice of non-ferrous metals producers and recyclers in Europe.

CBA-mechanisms are always second-best options in climate policy – even more so if they are unilateral. Multilateralism i.e. a broad global coalition of countries implementing ambitious climate policies together should remain as the best option and the overall goal for EU’s climate diplomacy. The EU has succeeded in leading and should continue to lead and push for progress in such a broad coalition through its own convincing policies. A broad coalition of ambitious countries would also create a demand pull for cutting-edge clean technologies developed in the EU and elsewhere.\n\nThe Commission should analyse whether CBA mechanisms are indeed necessary and the best policy avenue for the EU. If that would be the case, the Commission should in its communication propose, under which conditions CBA mechanisms should be introduced.\n\nThe problem definition for CBA mechanisms begins with the presumption “As long as many international partners do not share the same climate ambition as the EU, there is a risk of carbon leakage.” In this context, it is worth noting that in its proposal for European Climate Law in March 2020, the Commission deliberately excluded the option of reducing emissions or increasing removals outside EU’s borders. Such framing almost automatically implies a higher price of carbon and higher mitigation costs for the EU, as likely more cost-effective mitigation options outside the EU where “the same climate ambition is not shared” cannot be utilized. It therefore seems that the need for CBA mechanisms is partly dependent on whether the EU is open for emissions trading across its outer borders.\n\nThere is hardly any experience – even at technical level - about the use of CBA mechanisms. Implementation of such mechanisms in US or Canadian States is indeed worth exploring, but at the same time, it needs to be recognized that they are not comparable with the EU introducing such mechanisms for global trade.\n\nWe note that the planned roadmap is planning to carefully consider different types of policy instruments, methodological approaches for technical implementation and sectoral scopes. While all of this is useful, the Commission should also analyse and evaluate the political counterparty risks of CBA options, including risks like trade wars and backsliding in global implementation of the Paris Agreement and in the UNFCCC. These kinds of risks may be difficult to specify and quantify, but can be immensely important for decision-making in the EU institutions and should not be ignored.\n\nIf CBA mechanisms were introduced, that should take place gradually. The focus should first be in a few sectors, which are import-intensive (at EU and/or MS level) and where products are emission-intensive. The electricity generation sector with fossil fuels might be one of the candidates.\n",

European companies bear a financial burden resulting from the European Union's ambitious climate goals and policies that do not affect competitors in third countries. Despite the coming into force of the Paris Agreement, it is currently unlikely that other countries will define similarly ambitious climate goals and take action through concrete policy measures. Moreover, the EU plans to significantly and unilaterally increase its CO2 reduction targets within the framework of the European Green Deal. Many technical solutions for mitigating CO2 are still at the pilot stage and far from being economically feasible. Therefore, the European Union should focus on finding ways to both reduce CO2 emissions and strengthen the competitiveness of European companies and the attractiveness of the EU as a business location. The existing carbon leakage protection mechanisms, such as free allocation in the European emissions trading system and electricity price compensation, are effective and should be extended where needed. Phasing out these instruments would jeopardise the competitiveness of the companies both globally and in the Single Market. Alternatives to free allocation and electricity price compensation would have to provide both equivalent protection and legal and political certainty. The carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanisms under consideration risk provoking retaliatory trade measures and begetting more protectionism. The German economy, which is highly dependent on international trade, would particularly stand to suffer. Moreover, a number of important questions remain as to the mechanisms’ compatibility with WTO and EU law, which should be answered before the introduction of a CBA. These include the question of how the principle of non-discrimination between domestic and foreign companies can be observed. Creating new trade barriers should be avoided, as should the erosion of the multilateral, rule-based trading system by further WTO-incompatible unilateral measures. It is crucial for the German economy that new regulations on carbon leakage do not unduly restrict global trade and do not pave the way to more protectionism in times of increasing trade conflicts. The economic effects of CBA mechanisms are unclear and difficult to predict. Given the complexity of value chains, a CBA might lead to distortions that would negatively affect the whole economy. For example, the competitiveness of companies that process products subject to a CBA could be impaired. In particular, negative effects should be avoided on companies that offer their products in markets outside the EU and thus face international competition.

Safeguarding the competitiveness of the export industry should, therefore, be a priority in a possible reform of the carbon leakage protection mechanisms. Effective mitigation of climate change requires global solutions and coordinated action by all relevant CO2-emitting countries. However, it is doubtful whether the introduction of a CBA mechanism would promote international cooperation in the fight against climate change and thus lead to the necessary global reduction of CO2 emissions. We recommend stepping up efforts for global COz pricing and facilitating trade in climate and environmental protection technologies - ,e.g., through trade policy initiatives such as the WTO Environmental Goods Agreement. In bilateral trade agreements, the EU can play a pioneering role with ambitious energy and sustainability chapters. There are serious doubts as to whether a CBA mechanism could be established without excessive red tape and in a way that companies could manage, especially small and medium-sized importers, exporters and suppliers. A comprehensive investigation of possible customs law issues and a critical examination of the capacities of customs are necessary. The practical implementation of CBA mechanisms brings numerous challenges. It is unclear how the COz footprint of imported goods can reliably and precisely be determined. Simply resorting to benchmark values would not be appropriate given the often company- or plant-specific differences in the COz intensity of production. Calculating the COz2 cost burden within the EU is also challenging due to the fluctuating certificate prices in emissions trading and a plant-related free allocation of certificates. Competitive disadvantages for companies causing carbon leakage also arise from national climate protection policies, such as the national emissions trading system in Germany. The EU state aid rules should allow measures to avoid carbon leakage in the Single Market. This is particularly relevant because national measures are put into place to achieve EU targets. At the same time, the European Union should make efforts to consolidate national solutions at the EU level, which in the long run would create a level playing field. In light of the above, any adaptation of the existing carbon leakage protection instruments, such as the introduction of CBA mechanisms, should be considered only after a comprehensive impact assessment with the earliest possible involvement of economic actors. Furthermore, alternatives such as the extension of existing protection mechanisms (free allocation, electricity price compensation) must be seriously considered.\nRepresentation of DIHK | Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce to the EU\n19 A-D, Avenue des Arts | B-1000 Brussels\nTel. +32 2 286-1611 | Fax +32 2 286-1605 | Internet: www.dihk.de\n-2-\nWo we are\nThe Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag, DIHK) is the central organisation of 79 Chambers of Commerce and Industry, CCI (Industrie- und Handelskammern, IHKs) in Germany, representing 3.6 million companies from industry, commerce and services.

April 2020\nDeutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag\nLeitlinien zu CO.-Grenzausgleichsmechanismen\n1 Die Unternehmen sind auf einen wirksamen und effizienten Schutz vor Carbon Leakage angewiesen. Die durch hohe Klimaschutzambitionen der EU entstehenden Belastungen europäischer Unternehmen fallen in anderen Wirtschaftsräumen nicht oder in deutlich geringerem Maße an. Denn trotz des Inkrafttretens des Pariser Übereinkommens ist zurzeit nicht absehbar, dass andere Länder ähnlich ambitionierte Klimaschutzziele definieren und mit konkreten Maßnahmen unterfüttern. Zudem plant die EU, ihre CO;- Reduktionsziele im Rahmen des Green Deals weiter signifikant und unilateral zu verschärfen. Technische Möglichkeiten zur Vermeidung von CO; befinden sich erst in der Erprobung und sind zurzeit weit davon entfernt, wirtschaftlich darstellbar zu sein. Die Europäische Union sollte sich daher viel intensiver mit der Frage beschäftigen, wie die CO;>- Minderungen mit einer Stärkung der Standortqualität der EU und der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der europäischen Unternehmen verbunden werden können. Die bestehenden Carbon Leakage-Schutzmechanismen, wie freie Zuteilung im Europäischen Emissionshandelssystem und Strompreiskompensation, haben sich bewährt und sollten bedarfsgerecht ausgeweitet werden. Eine Abschaffung würde die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der betroffenen Unternehmen auf den Weltmärkten, aber auch im Binnenmarkt gefährden. Alternativen zur freien Zuteilung und Strompreiskompensation müssten eine äquivalente Schutzwirkung entfalten, sowie rechtlich und politisch beständig sein. Die erwogenen CO;-Grenzausgleichsmechanismen bergen das Risiko, handelspolitische Gegenmaßnahmen zu provozieren und könnten sich zum Einfallstor für mehr Protektionismus entwickeln. Die internationalisierte deutsche Wirtschaft würde hierunter ganz besonders leiden. Zudem wirft die Kompatibilität mit den Regeln der Welthandelsorganisation und dem EU-Recht zahlreiche Fragen auf, die vor der Einführung eines CBA beantwortet sein sollten. Hierzu zählt beispielsweise, inwiefern das Prinzip der Nicht-Diskriminierung heimischer und ausländischer Unternehmen eingehalten werden kann. Die Errichtung neuer Handelsbarrieren sollte vermieden und die Erosion des multilateralen regelbasierten Handelssystems durch weitere WTO-widrige unilaterale Maßnahmen verhindert werden.

Die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen von CO;-Grenzausgleichsmechanismen sind unklar und nur schwer vorherzusehen. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass sich aufgrund der Komplexität von Wertschöpfungsketten Verwerfungen ergeben, die zu gesamtwirtschaftlich negativen Effekten führen. So könnte die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Unternehmen, die einem CO;-Ausgleich unterfallende Produkte weiterverarbeiten, beeinträchtigt werden. Vermieden werden sollten insbesondere auch negative Auswirkungen auf Unternehmen, die ihre Produkte auf Märkten außerhalb der EU im internationalen Wettbewerb anbieten. Der exportorientierten deutschen Wirtschaft würde ein Instrument, das ausschließlich auf den europäischen Markt abzielt, schaden. Dem Erhalt der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Exportwirtschaft sollte daher im Falle einer Reform der Carbon Leakage- Schutzmechanismen eine hohe Priorität eingeräumt werden. Zur wirksamen Eindämmung des Klimawandels bedarf es globaler Lösungsansätze und eines koordinierten Handelns aller relevanten CO;-emittierenden Länder. Es ist jedoch zweifelhaft, ob die Einführung eines CO»-Grenzausgleichsmechanismus die internationale Zusammenarbeit beim Kampf gegen den Klimawandel befördert und dadurch zur notwendigen weltweiten Reduktion der CO>-Emissionen führt. Der DIHK empfiehlt, Anstrengungen für eine weltweite Bepreisung von COzzu intensivieren und den Handel mit Klima- und Umweltschutztechnologien - z. B. durch handelspolitische Initiativen wie das WTO-Umweltgüterabkommen - zu erleichtern. In bilateralen Handelsabkommen kann die EU mit ehrgeizigen Energie- und Nachhaltigkeitskapiteln eine Vorreiterrolle spielen. Es bestehen ernste Zweifel, ob ein CO2-Grenzausgleich für Unternehmen, insbesondere kleine und mittelständische Importeure, Exporteure und Zulieferer handhabbar und bürokratiearm ausgestaltet werden könnte. Eine umfangreiche Untersuchung möglicher zollrechtlicher Fragen und eine kritische Prüfung der Kapazitäten im Zollbereich tut hier Not. Ein CO; -Grenzausgleich bringt in der praktischen Umsetzung zahlreiche Herausforderungen mit sich. Fraglich ist, wie sich der CO;-Fußabdruck importierter Waren zuverlässig und präzise feststellen lässt. Allein auf Benchmark-Werte zurückzugreifen würde der oft unternehmens- und/oder anlagenspezifisch unterschiedlichen CO;-Intensität der Produktion nicht gerecht. Die Berechnung der innerhalb der EU anfallenden CO;-Kostenbelastung ist aufgrund der im Emissionshandel fluktuierenden Zertifikate-Preise und einer anlagenbezogenen freien Zuteilung von Zertifikaten ebenfalls herausfordernd.\nVertretung des DIHK | Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag e.V. bei der EU\n19 A-D, Avenue des Arts | B-1000 Bruxelles\nTel. +32 2 286-1611 | Fax +32 2 286-1605 | Internet: www.dihk.de\n-2-\n8. Wettbewerbsnachteile für Unternehmen, die zu Carbon Leakage führen, entstehen auch durch nationale Klimaschutzpolitiken, wie dem nationalen Emissionshandelssystem (nEHS) in Deutschland. Die EU sollte im Rahmen der beihilferechtlichen Vorgaben Maßnahmen zur Vermeidung von Carbon Leakage im Binnenmarkt zulassen. Dies gilt ganz besonders vor dem Hintergrund, dass die nationalen Maßnahmen zur Erreichung der EU-Ziele ergriffen werden. Gleichzeitig sollte die Europäische Union Anstrengungen unternehmen, nationale Lösungen auf EU-Ebene zusammenzuführen, wodurch perspektivisch eine Angleichung der Wettbewerbsbedingungen erreicht würde.

In order to deliver the required benefits for the chemical industry, the following key principles should apply:\nPerc\nDiscussion Paper\nMarch 2020\n1. Export competitiveness must be ensured\nThe European chemical industry is an export champion. It currently exports around 30% of its production outside Europe, making the EU the biggest chemicals exporting region in the world with a €45bn trade surplus for chemical products. Any new system should reinforce Europe’s strength in the EU chemicals industry as well as its downstream value chains.\n2. WTO compatibility must be ensured\nAny system must be WTO compatible and therefore consider the non-discriminatory, differentiation and “likeness” principles of the WTO as well as possible allowed exceptions under Article XX. Furthermore, any system should be in line with and support the Paris Agreement.\n3. Promote international dialogue to avoid trade conflicts\nThe EU will remain open to and depend upon international free and fair trade and will have to engage in dialogue with its trading partners in order to avoid trade conflicts affecting non-concerned sectors. This dialogue in the context of the Paris Agreement or bilateral trade agreements could also promote the setting up of a global carbon pricing mechanism. Using trade agreements in this regard could be an option, as long as provisions incentivise trading partners to adopt ambitious climate objectives or obligations.\n4. Use revenues completely to support low carbon manufacturing and investment\nRevenues resulting from new measures should be entirely used to level the global playing field between competing industries* as well as for low carbon investment and industrial manufacturing transformation.\n5. Current carbon leakage safeguard must not be compromised\nThe ETS, with its free allocation principle and established framework until 2030, is an appropriate climate tool for mitigating domestic GHG emissions of the EU industry. However, the shrinking free allocation until 2030 will increase the exposure to competition from third countries that do not face similar, increased CO2 costs, thus un-levelling the playing field. Any future measures therefore would need to be complementary to the ETS free allocation system, so as to effectively cover carbon leakage risks at least in a comparable or better manner as the current free allocation system in the EU ETS, including the compensation of indirect emissions costs. Any system should ensure reliable and predictable conditions essential for technology-neutral investment decisions.\n6. Cost and complexity must be minimised, while the framework must be robust\nAny chosen option should not unnecessarily increase compliance costs or add administrative burden for the EU chemical industry as well as authorities. Still, robust monitoring, reporting and verification will need to be established ensuring legal certainty and equal treatment of international competitors.\nConcluding remarks\nWhile contributing to this consultation we are very aware we are experiencing unprecedented times, with events none of us have lived through before. Cefic endeavours to maintain a high standard in our responses to public consultations. While we are confident that this contribution adequately reflects\n1 Taxation import side should compensation export side: For sectors exporting goods from Europe on mean on to other regions, EU carbon costs that not incurred in competing regions would have to be compensated.\nBceric\nDiscussion Paper\nMarch 2020\nour views at the current time, we recognise that public and private sector responses to the crisis and its aftermath, both in the EU and globally, have the potential to significantly affect industry’s operating conditions.

We look to the European Commission to undertake the appropriate assessments and to include these wider considerations in the future framework that will be developed, with the objective of ensuring the EU’s post-crisis attractiveness as a place for investing in the industrial transformation required to achieve the objectives of the EU Green Deal."

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association"

When EU carbon charges are set on course from EUR 25 to EUR 50 in the future and even higher thereafter to EUR 100 plus, it is imperative that “equal treatment” of applied climate costs on fertilizer manufacturing costs is introduced. Unequal treatment will result in carbon leakage.\nThe global fertilizer industry is a worldwide commodity trading sector and therefore highly competitive and trade intensive (trade intensity indicator: 31.8%). Equally, the close supply relationship of the fertilizer industry with agriculture is a determinant factor in food quality and food security of supply. 50% of the global population depends on fertilizer use for their nutritious food supply. The presence of a robust domestic fertilizer industry to timely provide high quality nutrients to local farming is of paramount socio-economic and thus political importance. The consequent preservation of such an EU- industry in a viable and level playing field towards the global competition, both on the European and export markets, is beneficial to all stakeholders. A necessity to preserve the future of an EU sector, especially when that European fertilizer industry has evolved into a global leader on sustainability\n\nFertilizers Europe asbl Avenue des Nerviens 9-31 1040 Etterbeek, Brussels, Belgium Tel: +32 2 675 35 50 No enterprise BE 0894.132.637 Transparency register nr. 80788715017-29\nmain@fertilizerseurope.com\nwww.fertilizerseurope.com\nINFINITE\nFERTILIZERS\nfertilizers\neurope\n—————_=essé'rr.'—m\nINFINITE\nFERTILIZERS\nThe EU fertilizer sector has drastically reduced (more than 90%) its N2O emissions, as important greenhouse gas during the last ten years and the sector is close to the practical current technology limits of energy efficiency in ammonia production. Whilst ammonia production, as inevitable precursor for nitrogen fertilizer, is still very fossil fuel intensive, very low carbon ammonia is technically in reach and in the long term has the potential to become a crucial element in decarbonizing the shipping and energy sectors alongside the production of low carbon fertilizers and low carbon food production systems. However, this transition inevitably requires access to low-carbon and competitively priced energy and feedstock, infrastructure, legislation, innovation and support schemes. And given the huge capital intensity, such decarbonisation investments require economic justification in both domestic and foreign markets.\nIn order to be able to contribute to climate-neutrality and a prospering EU industry by 2050, carbon leakage should be avoided. Current protection measures under EU ETS are not enough to limit our sector’s genuine exposure. Since 2014, the EU fertilizer sector has no surplus and is a net buyer of free allowances. Investments in ammonia/fertilizer capacities are happening mostly outside of the EU. Imported fertilizers with a higher carbon footprint have increasingly substituted domestic EU product, resulting in an import penetration increasing from 20% to 30% of EU consumption over the last decade and a net increase of GHG emissions globally. Therefore, we support the idea of applying Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism as a principle.\nCBAM should be implemented simply in addition and without interfering with the current ETS free allocation. The adjustment could be based on the difference between the product benchmark set in EU ETS and the actual carbon intensity of imported products. Also, the system should impose a standard adjustment rate to imports but also allow any foreign exporter to prove that they are greener than the standard rate, and then benefit from individual rates. It should also include equivalent measures for EU-based exporters. With these elements, a WTO-compatible CBAM design could be (relatively) easy for simple products such as fertilizers and ammonia.\nAll in all, there are multiple parameters, conditions and modalities which deserve a thorough closer look before deciding on the future of such a socio-economically important EU manufacturing industry.\nTherefore, fertilizers and ammonia should be evaluated in the CBAM impact assessment study.\nAbout Fertilizers Europe\nFertilizers Europe represents the interests of the majority of mineral fertilizer manufacturers in the European Union. The association’s membership comprises 16 fertilizer manufacturers from countries across the Union and eight national fertilizer associations. The association communicates with a wide variety of stakeholders, institutions, European and national policy-makers and members of the general public who seek information on fertilizer products and application technology, and topics relating to today’s agricultural, environmental and economic challenges."

The green step forward the EC has made towards achieving a carbon neutrality by 2050 by adopting a European Green Agreement and a plan to adopt the first climate law will include a major contribution to the achievement of the goals in terms of achieving Europe’s relief contribution by 2050. However, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to take into account the countries of the Western Balkans that are aspiration to be EU members, as well as their goals that benefit in terms of achieving the confiscation of national economies.\n\nIn relation to the energy sector on the energy sector, comments will be returned to this sector.\nWe are of the opinion that the introduction of a CO2 combat tax that the EC plans to adopt in the coming period is already not more part of the ETS system and are therefore a significant added cover for the Western Balkans countries have either have levies, taxes or the feed they pay for the emission of CO2, which is integrated into the selling prices of final products located in the EU markets. This is well Illustrated by the following example:\nCurrenly, the price of electricity in Montenegro is formed by comparing it to the prices of the energy on the HUPX Stock Exchange in Hungary. All thermal power plants participating in this stock exchange have an obligation to pay a CO2 emission fee, which significant increases their production costs. As the Pljevlja TPP is not included in the EU ETS system, it does not pay a CO2 fee and defines the same price as those producers are made up of CO2 emissions. It is clear that this EU producer is in an unprecedented position and the principles of equality and non-discrimination in the market are not respected. All countries in the same market must comply with the same environmental standards, state aid rules and pay the price for CO2 emissions.\n\nFor the time being, Montenegro is the only Western Balkans country to have adopted a regulation definition of CO2 payments, although in life benchmarks it will still not have application given that free CO2 emissions are defined for the county industries and pollutants. \nTherefore, the marginal CO2 tax must also be applied to the countries of the Energy Community, as they do not continuously pay for CO2, and they are not planning to so, until so, until the EU so to so.\n\nTherefore, the margin tax must also be applied to the countries of the Energy Community, and it should be at a level that can be used as a positive for confiscation. In addition, cause of the EU’s increased efforts to achieve the climate, it will be more difficulty for countries planning to continue their legislation with the EU in the future unless they have already begun with adaptation. In addition, defining a tax tax for the energy sector will also have a significant impact on countries’ plans to review and build new Co-operative new powers plants, as well will contribute to reducing the cost-effectiveness of such projects, as well as their complete independence.",

Achieving climate neutrality will require bold actions to build an ultra-efficient economy and accelerating direct electrification.\nWithin the green deal it is the right moment to reevaluate the carbon pricing instruments. We are drafting a common response document to the European Commission’s consultations on the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), also looking at the link with the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). We call the European Commission to develop an common approach for those three policy instruments.  \n- Today electricity represents around 20% of final energy use and all 2050 carbon neutral scenario converge towards a multiplication by 2 to 3 to this share of electricity based on massive electrification of heat and transport based on low carbon power generation.

In 2019, we have committed to become carbon neutral by 2025\". *. Intermediate targets and milestones are also critical to ensure Europe is on the right path to become climate neutral mid-century. The European Union shall also consider increasing its CO2 emissions from 40% to 55% by 2030 if it wants to become the first climate neutral continent on the planet, and the global leader of the new world of energy. Achieving climate neutrality will require bold actions to build an ultra-efficient economy and accelerating direct electrification: As stated by the IPCC report, urgent and unprecedent efforts are needed. Three critical elements are required to make sure Europe is on track, through a mix of legislative and non-legislative measures: energy efficiency, electrification (fuel switch), and decarbonization of energy sources. EU Green Deal and industry policy hand and hand: The EU Green Deal must become a driver for Europe’s strategy and rebuild the European economy, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, with decarbonization as the main driver. Policy-wise, the most urgent action is to develop carbon pricing instruments that would be effective both internally and externally. EU has been one of the front runners in carbon pricing within the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) first phase starting in 2005 and covering almost half of its CO2 emissions; furthermore, and for the part not covered by the ETS a number of member states have incorporated in their national energy taxation a carbon component which may be significant. Within the green deal it is the right moment to reevaluate the carbon pricing instruments. We are drafting a common response document to the European Commission’s consultations on the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), also looking at the link with the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). We call the European Commission to develop an common approach for those three policy instruments. Today electricity represents around 20% of final energy use and all 2050 carbon neutral scenario converge towards a multiplication by 2 to 3 to this share of electricity based on massive electrification of heat and transport based on low carbon power generation. This will require a significant transformation of the actual demand side with an active participation in energy efficiency, local low carbon generation and storage and the development of active flexible electricity demand. The use of carbon revenue is key in earmarking money towards low carbon investments. Equally important is look at the social acceptance of carbon pricing by mitigating the distributional effect on low income people,; impact assessments shall evaluate how carbon revenue can be 100% earmarked with these two objectives.\nAs far as Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is concerned:\ne Risks of commercial retaliation (WTO compliance) shall be carefully evaluated as well as consequences on final prices to European businesses and consumers e Compliance with WTO shall be a prerequisite and the impact assessment shall make a deep evaluation of this.\n' Schneider Electric press release for the COP25: https://www.se.com/ww/en/Images/06-release-cop-25_tcm564-111592. pdf ? Schneider Electric press release for the COP25: https://www.se.com/ww/en/Images/06-release-cop-25_tcm564-111592. pdf\ne A careful and detailed analysis of what shall be the CO2 parameters and indicator to be used shall be made and the complexity of what shall be in place will have to be evaluated in detail. Competitive advantage of a powerful domestic low carbon market; will certainly bring add-value to the EU industry. Such parameter should be taken into account in the context of the work on CBAM. e A possible alternative would be to support low-carbon production of products in industry, by introducing incentives for reducing embedded carbon in production with emission benchmarks for low-carbon alternatives (e.g. recycling steel, etc.).\nAs far as Energy Taxation Directive is concerned\ne ETS is covering only 45% of EU emissions, some member states have added a carbon price component within carbon taxes on the non ETS sectors and specifically building and transport, this shall be generalized at EU level. Today, in Europe, taxation and levies are far higher on electricity than on gas and this hamper electrification development specifically for heating. On top of this, the current ETD is looking at electricity tax irrespective of its source, meaning electricity coming from renewable energy sources is taxed the same way as electricity stemming from fossil fuels. A level playing field considering CO2 content of the energy vector would avoid today limitation on electrification development ; hand subsidies to renewable are basically supported by electricity consumers in the retail cost of electricity (the overcharge can go up to 25% ) while gas consumers benefits from subsidies in the form of taxes reductions which can go up to 30% (ref 3) and (ref 4). Energy Taxation Directive and the per-unit energy tax widely implemented in the European Member States do not provide consumers with financial incentives for demand flexibility and demand response; impact assessment shall evaluate implementation of tax incentivization of demand flexibility in smart dynamic retail tariffs A specific attention on electricity used for EV charging is needed in order to avoid burdening of EV operation cost and smart charging and use of EV in demand flexibility shall be encouraged possibly with lower taxation and levies A significant amount of tax exemptions on fossil fuels is still a reality in EU : 50 billion Euro according to a study made by Trinomics in 2018 for the European commission (ref 5) ; aplan to phase out these fossil fuels subsidies (possibly gradually with a target of full phase out by 2030) furthermore any tax exemption could be conditional to low carbon actions implementation such as energy efficiency, renewable local generation, increase of demand flexibility etc. We call on the European Commission to consider minimizing the level of taxes applied to electricity in order to foster clean and renewable based electrification. We call on the European Commission to avoid double taxation of electricity by notifying in the ETD revision that electricity cannot be considered as end-consumption when supplied to storage facilities.\nAs far as Emission Trading Scheme is concerned\ne Carbon has a cost, and this should be reflected in the energy price; This CO2 price shall be predictable, growing over the time and within certain limits. In the last years Carbon price has been very volatile with a long period of low prices (few euros only) due to sur allocation of quotas followed by a significant increase (in the range of 25 to 30 € ) further to adaptation with backlogging and Market Stability Reserve (ref 2). Brexit on one hand and impact of COVI 19 will clearly increase price volatility with a decrease phase e This price volatility shall be limited by a mechanism with at least a price floor and possibly a price cap organizing a type of corridor in a growing predictable evolution over the time\nThe extension of ETS to other sectors (in particular heating in building) shall be evaluated carefully and comparison with a carbon tax made in term of complexity of feasibility, cost of verification and control and costs for the energy users ; Cap and trade and carbon tax should not be opposed but used in synergy. Carbon pricing policies for buildings should be considered to ensure a decarbonization of the building stock. Free allocation to Carbon Intensive and Trade Exposed (CITE) industries should be given with counterparts such as R&D in green tech, investments in energy efficiency, investments in renewable etc. Carbon price global convergence should be organized through international negotiations within appropriate organizations (COP 26 will be an important opportunity for this) Critically, a dedicated carbon pricing policy for buildings is crucially needed. Europe should start by addressing CO2 emissions of cities and buildings, which are the bedrock of global decarbonization. We call on the European Commission to consider an emissions cap on large C&l buildings One policy example lies in “The Climate Mobilization Act”, adopted by the city of New- York in 2019. The new legislation requires that any building of 2000m2 or larger will need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline, increasing to a 80% reduction requirement by 2050. The measure will mainly affect non- residential buildings. A possible pathway could be to introduce first limits for the most carbon-intensive 20% of buildings, and then extend the limits for the most carbon intensive 75% of buildings. An earlier timeline should be deployed for buildings own by governments.\nReference\n1/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/32247/UsingCarbonRevenu es.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y\n2/ https://www.refinitiv.com/perspectives/market-insights/will-high-european-carbon-prices- last/ —\n3/ https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d7c9d93b-1879-11e9-8d04-\n01aa/75ed71a1\n4/ https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8489689/8-291 1201 7-AP-\nFR.pdf/9f521832-eb7f-4613-9c38-6c7b45cdf029\n5/http://trinomics.eu/project/energy prices costs _and_ subsidies and their impact_on_indu\nstry_and_households/\n6/ Bohringer, Balistreri & Rutherford (2012) — The role of border carbon adjustment in\nunilateral climate policy: Overview of an Energy Modeling Forum Study"

        "feedback": "The EU’s ambitious climate objectives\nMany energy-intensive industries are key industrial value chains for the European economy and their pathway towards net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is likely to be challenging.\nTo meet these ambitious goals, the EU will need to ensure that European economies and industries swiftly transition to a low-carbon economy in a cost-efficient way. \n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism may be needed in order to minimise carbon leakage.\nAs long as no global price for carbon emissions is established and until countries align with the same climate ambitions, a carbon border adjustment mechanism may be necessary to minimise the risk of carbon leakage and incentivise decarbonisation outside of the EU. \nAs we approach Phase IV of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) which is expected to increase the carbon price to all-time highs, the real test for European industries and economies is still to come. In preparation for the potential carbon leakage, the EU aims to create an internationally more level playing field for these industries through the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). \n\nAs such, the CBAM will be directly complementary to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), so the EU must ensure that the EU has an emissions trading system with an appropriate carbon price and adequate rules. Therefore, the current review of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (MRR) is quintessential to the successful development of the CBAM. In line with this, an accurate carbon accounting system will be needed. Such an accounting system would need to take into account the benefits related to the use of energy efficient technologies, bioenergy, waste-to-energy, renewable fuels of non-biological origin and CCUS.\n\nSpecifically, the benefits of all types of CCU need to be recognised. It needs to be understood that many types of mineralisation (next to the recognised precipitated calcium carbonate) can permanently store carbon. Furthermore, the MRR needs to recognise that the capture and use of CO2 in fuels does not lead to additional emissions and that thus these fuels need to be regarded as low carbon or zero carbon when compliant with article 25 of REDII (2018/2001/EU). \n\nFinally, the potential of negative emission technologies needs to be revisited. Currently, plants that would capture CO2 from the air or from sustainably sourced biomass complying with art. 29 of REDII  and ensure the permanent storage of the captured carbon are not adequately remunerated. These technologies need to be remunerated for their contribution to the decrease of atmospheric carbon levels. Without remuneration, the technologies will struggle to mature and the rollout of these much needed negative emission technologies will be delayed or even completely barred from commercialisation.\nA CBAM should, therefore, contribute towards a low-carbon and competitive European industrial sector, supporting the EU’s climate goals while acknowledging all measures that lead to real carbon abatements. \n\nEnergy Technologies Europe (ETE) represents the suppliers of energy conversion technologies.\nMembers are located throughout Europe and are engineering cutting edge technologies contributing to a clean, secure, and affordable energy supply. ETE is particularly engaged with the future of the EU’s decarbonised industry with a focus on a multitude of technologies ranging from energy efficiency, bioenergy, waste to energy, renewable fuels and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). \n",

Methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products:\n1 April 2020\nFEIQUE’s comments on the European Commission’s Inception Impact Assessment regarding a Carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)\nsete eee ee eee e cee n eee eee n eee n eee nese nese nese nese esse eee nese ease eee ee ee ee eee eee ee et Eee Ee eeE nese eee nese nese nese nese eee eee eee eee\nIt is supposed that the study currently underway to identify the risk of carbon leakage in the third and fourth trading phases of the EU ETS will involve the ETS sectors as part of a dedicated assessment (ETS directive related). In that respect, it is of utmost importance that both ETS and CBAM assessments are conducted in parallel with a high level of involvement of the sectors at stake in order to evaluate carefully the convenience of complementary CBAM to ETS, or replacement of ETS.\n1.Type of policy instrument:\n(text in IIA) “The legal and technical feasibility of each measure will need to be carefully assessed, also in relation to the EU’s trade acquis (the rules of the World Trade Organisation and EU’s trade agreements) and other international commitments. The complementarity of the measure with internal carbon pricing, in particular the EU ETS, will also have to be assessed, as well as how it relates to the current measures to avoid the risk of carbon leakage. The measure should be commensurate with the internal EU carbon price.\nVarious options could include a carbon tax on selected products — both on imported and domestic products, a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports, or the extension of the EU ETS to imports”.\nComments\ne The proposed measure (whatever the policy options envisaged) would apply only to imports into the EU (on selected products — both on imported and domestic products). For that reason, any CBAM cannot be a complete replacement alternative to measures that currently address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU (as those current measures also provide carbon leakage protection for exports, being the free allocation). In the event of discontinuing existing carbon leakage protection mechanisms, such as free allowances, through establishing a CBAM, alternative protection mechanism for EU exports need to be employed to not unduly punish EU industry. Since the impacts of a CBAM will vary much depending on the design and in particular of the sectors covered, a detailed and covered sectors impact assessment should be made. It seems to apply only to ETS sectors, if not, it should be detailed in a better way in the IIA/future and coming IA. For example, alternative approach of product C content could imply more than industrial ETS emissions, such emissions coming from the use of product (example, energy products, not applied for chemical), but emissions coming from the production of alternative raw materials in chemical production should be considered with this alternative approach. (linked this comment to the Circular Economy latest one in point 3)\n(text in IIA) “Under the EU ETS, a system of harmonised EU-wide benchmarks has been developed for industrial processes. To the extent that a sector is covered by the EU ETS, a border measure could be based on similar methodological considerations as for ETS, i.e. benchmark values, unless the exporter certifies a lower carbon content and/or a higher carbon cost at origin. The Commission will also look at alternative approaches, e.g. defining carbon content of products, taking into account their interaction with existing and future climate policies”.\nComment:\nIt seems to be applied only for ETS sectors. It is described the option to develop a similar to ETS Benchmarking values and as another option, alternative approaches, but it is not clarified if these other alternative approaches will be applied to non-ETS sectors.\n3. Sectoral scope:\n(text in IIA) “An important part of the work will also relate to the selection of sectors subject to this measure. A scoping in terms of sectors concerned will have to be defined to ensure that the measure applies where the risk of carbon leakage is the highest. The assessment will take as starting point the study currently underway that the Commission launched to identify the risk of carbon leakage in the third and fourth trading phases of the EU ETS”.\nComment:\nUnder the currently carbon leakage criteria and assessment, in chemical sector there is variability in carbon leakage, (for example, NACE 2014 is included in direct emissions ETS carbon leakage but exempted in indirect cost aids). Therefore, to determine highest sectors more criteria should be taken into account. Circular economy is one European pillar with most application and impact in chemical raw materials and so that the chemical products, and should be a driver to determine the climate friendly topic of an EU product versus non-EU product. That is, in case chemical products should not be considered as highest sectors to be included in these CBAM, because being at the middle in the C leakage ETS criteria, another issue as the Circular economy driver should be taken into account to give more climate value to our products and to oblige to be considered in the CBAM.\neee et teeter et ttt Ot tite tree tet teet iret treet tenet rrr errr rr rrr errr rrr rr rere e rere treet\nContacto/ Informacién\nrrr rrr Serre Serr re errr r rere etree rer rte rt Sr re ener ene\nere\nrenenes\nLaura Castrillo, Directora de Asuntos Industriales\nTfno: 91 431 79 64 - E-mail: \\castrillo@feique.org\nsete ence eee eeeeeeee eee eeee cere eeeeeeee eee nese eeee nese eee nese eee eeee eee eee eee eee e eee Ee eee eee eee eee eee Eee\nLa Industria Quimica genera en Espafia el 12,4% del Producto Industrial Bruto y mds de 570.000 empleos directos, indirectos e inducidos.

It reflects the preliminary analysis of IndustriAll Europe’s secretariat but is not an official policy document.\nFor IndustriAll Europe, increasing the EU climate ambition in a context of global asymmetrical climate policies requires — among other instruments - a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to include imports into the EU Emission Trading System and to exempt exports from the impact of such a scheme. If IndustriAll Europe supports the general idea of having an EU CBAM to accompany the efforts to reduce emissions by 2030 and 2050, many issues related to its design and implementation will require further discussion among our membership. The aim of this document is to present IAE preliminary views on the need for a CBAM and to identify the main issues to be further discussed to ensure that the future mechanism will secure mutual benefits for the EU climate policy and for the EU industry and its workers. To adequately inform policy-makers, IndustriAll Europe stresses the need to intensively consult social partners from the various concerned sectors during later stages of the decision-making process.\nBackground\nReaching carbon neutrality by 2050, as announced in the European Green Deal Communication, represents an unprecedented challenge for the EU. In the same way, moving the 2030 EU emission reduction target from 40 to 50-55% triggers fundamental questions for the future of many industries. This is especially true for sectors that combine high emission and trade intensities. Decarbonising energy-intensive industries (Ell) will require the deployment of technologies that will imply, at least in the short term, significant investments and therefore extra-cost for the sectors at stake. The recently adopted “Masterplan for a competitive transformation of EU Energy-Intensive Industries”, identifies higher CAPEX, higher OPEX and important Infrastructure needs for the main technology options identified to decarbonise the Ell. In an open economy, where companies have to compete on European and global markets, these extra-costs, coming from climate policy, will only be economically viable if a series of accompanying measures are taken. Pushing technologies to the market through aggressive innovation policies will be of the utmost importance while creating lead markets through for instance standards, public procurements or contracts for difference will have a major role to play too. Still, a proportionate and targeted CBAM should protect the EU producers from the unfair competition of goods imported in the EU from countries where carbon pricing schemes are not comparable or not even existing. For sectors where this is economically relevant, it should also reduce the impact of carbon pricing instruments on EU companies exporting to markets\n$4 industriAll EUROPEAN TRADE UNION\nwith low or non-existing carbon price, in a way that should not lead to significant relocation of downstream industries . As shown by the recent failure to reach an agreement on the implementation of the Paris Agreement Article 6, having a global carbon-pricing system remains a concept without foreseeable implementation. Despite decades of intense negotiations, it has been impossible to make significant progress in the set up of a global carbon pricing mechanism. New initiatives need to be launched to level the playing field on the global markets Ell are operating. In addition, Ell remain important job providers in the EU (almost 6 million of workers in the EU) and are of the utmost strategic importance for a series of industrial sectors downstream the value chains (automotive, defence, shipbuilding, aerospace, rail, construction). Keeping and strengthening the related integrated value chains in the EU must be a political priority for the EU. As a result, an EU CBAM is an important element of a series of instruments that must lead to decarbonise these strategic sectors through innovation and investment without hampering their profitability and without threatening the related jobs.\nImportant implementation issues\nWhile many aspects of the CBAM will require further technical and political discussions, IndustriAll Europe has already identified the following elements as guiding principles for the upcoming decision-making process:\nChoosing a legal basis that would allow to adopt the instrument through an ordinary legislative procedure in order to avoid the unanimity requirement which is always an uncertain path to follow, is crucial to have the CBAM on time to complement the revised 2030 EU climate policy package and cope with its consequences for Ell competitiveness. In other words, ART 192 §1 of TFEU offers a safer legal basis than Art 192 §2 a), or Art 113 (Taxation). The scope must be targeted to sectors that are really in need of such a system. Making a full list would require an in-depth assessment of sectorial business models but sectors with high emissions — energy or process related - and exposed to a fierce competition on EU and global markets should be a priority. Sectors such as steel and basic metal, cement, electricity would be the most obvious sectors to be covered by the CBAM, without prejudging what the final list might look like. To cope with technological and market change, the CBAM should be dynamic and its scope should be regularly reviewed. To keep administrative cost as low as possible and for the sake of feasibility, we don’t believe appropriate to use a CBAM for more complex goods being made of hundreds or thousands of components. WTO compatibility and outreach. A fair and regulated international trade, based on multilateral rules, remains important for the EU industry. A CBAM should not be designed in a way that would damage the EU industry insertion in global value chains. The EU CBAM must therefore be in line with WTO rules. It must be based on clear and non-arbitrary criteria in order to provide for equal treatment for all trade partners and also provide equal treatment for domestic and foreign producers. Beyond the legal dimension, the EU should launch a massive outreach strategy to explain in relevant international fora (WTO, UNCTAD, G 20, UNFCCC) and bilaterally how the CBAM will work. The aim must be here to limit retaliation measures from trade partners by reassuring them on the non-discriminatory nature of the\n$4 industriAll EUROPEAN TRADE UNION\nCBAM, keeping in mind that retaliation measures can lead to the introduction of a complaint under the WTO dispute settlement system. Level/ intensity of the adjustment. The adjustment will have to be strictly proportionate to the additional costs due to the impact of the ETS allowances have on production costs. Indirect cost of the ETS through electricity price might be considered for the sectors at stake as well. Regarding the level of the “carbon adjustment”, it should be avoided to hurt disproportionately those industries downstream the value chain, that are not covered by the ETS, but for which access to the goods produced by Ell is a matter of competitiveness. Affordable basic materials is a matter of competitiveness for a series of strategic sectors such as the automotive industry. The design of CBAM should protect Ell against carbon leakage without threatening other sectors. Link with existing instruments to cushion carbon leakage. The European Commission Green Deal Communication presents the CBAM as an alternative to the existing instruments to protect industries from carbon leakage (mainly free allocation and compensation for the increase of electricity cost). This question will obviously require further discussion to ensure that no disproportionate windfall profits will be created but also to avoid disruptive change that might threaten short term profitability of sectors at stake. In the same way, the role of free allocation as a trigger to invest in existing plants should be explored. Moreover, preserving the competitiveness of EU exporting industries might require to explore hybrid systems where CBAM would target imports whereas free allocation would be used for exports. Use of financial resources. Combined with auctioning revenues, the CBAM might generate significant new and additional financial resources. Here again, taking a clear position on where and how money will be used is premature. However, bridging the investment gap to decarbonise the industries covered by the ETS should be the main objective ascribed to these new public financial resources."

        "feedback": "CARBON BORDER ADJUSTEMENT\n\nIt is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality. This measure should be applied, in the form of the customs on the imported products. We strongly oppose any other form of tax, fee or any other financial burden levied on the domestic EU production.  \n•\tA carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. \n•\tEU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation, but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets. A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies.  \n•\tWhile it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. \n•\tA carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. \n•\tSimilarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU. \n•\tAs long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets.  \n•\tIf a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation.\n•\tThe use of the EU ETS (benchmark) methodology in the carbon determination methodology, is the fastest solution. At the same time, we call on the Commission to prepare  the methodology for setting the amount of duty / charge and to link it to the EUA price. We do not support the development of a separate methodology for the determination of the carbon content of products as this would mean a considerable delay and prolongation of today's adverse situation\n•\tIt is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire lifecycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\n",

Proper identification and application of measures ensuring level playing field for EU industry and industry from third countries are crucial to stimulate GHG emissions reduction globally, as differences in levels of environmental ambition worldwide persist. As long as such situation occurs, there is a risk of carbon leakage, either because production is transferred from the EU to third countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because products manufactured in the EU are replaced by more carbon-intensive but cheaper products manufactured outside the EU.\nGENERAL COMMENTS\nPGNiG supports the introduction of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, however in our view it should complement existing tools, rather than replace them. Therefore we call for development of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism along with strengthening existing measures (allowances for energy intensive industry and compensation of EU ETS indirect costs). A level playing field ensured by such set of policies would ensure that European industry would still be involved in development of new technologies and solutions for transition towards climate neutral economy. This will help the EU to maintain its position as a global leader. Carbon leakage is a real threat to environment and if not addressed appropriately, it could result in increase of global emissions up to 70%. At first, sectors most exposed to carbon leakage risk, that experience significant decline of export of manufactured goods outside the European Union (as well as import of these goods to the EU) due to emission reduction requirements should be a subject to a CBAM measure. Introduction of pilot CBAM for one or several sectors would be reasonable.\n1) GAS SECTOR AS THE BACKBONE OF A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY\nPGNiG plays a key role on the Polish gas market and, as its leader, is responsible for preserving Poland’s energy security. Gas sector is a crucial element of energy transformation. Natural gas emits approx. 50% less CO, than coal when used to generate heat, which is necessary in industrial processes. Therefore natural gas as a transitional fuel will play significant role. However, gas should be also considered as target fuel, as gas sector can provide innovative solutions such as hydrogen, biogas, bio-methane.\nC€ PGNiG\n2) CARBON LEAKAGE AS A REAL THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT\nAccording to the KOBiZE* report”, which assesses the possible scale of the carbon leakage using different assumptions and policy scenarios within the EU, carbon leakage can limit the effectiveness of EU ETS and overall the comprehensive EU efforts to reduce global emission and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Report states that: ‘Adoption of more stringent policies in the EU will create incentives for other countries to relax their own emission reduction commitments. Thus not only would carbon leakage result in the loss of the EU industries by ‘leaking’ to places with weaker commitments, but it also means that global emissions could even increase as shown in the results of this paper’. According to the report, depending on specific scenario and assumptions, total emissions projection for the regions outside the EU would raise 20-70% between 2015 and 2030. Therefore, strengthening the existing measures preventing carbon leakage phenomenon is crucial to achieve Paris Agreement target and reduce emissions globally.\n3) ROLE OF INDUSTRY IN EU CLIMATE POLICY\nThe European Union strives to become climate-neutral and lead the global energy transformation. We agree that carbon adjustment can sour changes toward more sustainable products in the EU and third countries. With a support from the European Union (e.g. Horizon 2020 Programme), the EU industry (including gas sector, which develops solutions i.a. for hydrogen and biogases) plays a crucial role in this process as it develops innovative clean solutions, without which global energy transformation would decelerate, as industry in other parts of the world might not be that highly incentivized to develop low carbon solutions. A level playing field would ensure that energy intensive industry remains in Europe and thus, will be involved in development of new technologies/solutions contributing to achievement of EU climate ambitions. The commitment of European industry to decarbonization was stressed in the European Green Deal Communication’. Keeping energy intensive industry will not only stimulate growth of EU economy but will have a positive impact on climate, air quality and public health .\n4) SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EU INDUSTRY/ SECURITY OF EU ECONOMY\nThe outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 showed the weaknesses of economic models based on geographically stretched supply chains. As stated in the European Green Deal Communication energy-intensive industries, such as steel, chemicals and cement, are indispensable to Europe’s economy, as they supply several key value chains. As EU economy is highly dependent on economic relations with third countries, many European companies experienced disruptions in production due to broken supply chains. This results in economic losses across the EU and also applies to industry considered as exposed to carbon leakage risk. To mitigate the negative impact of such unexpected situations, the EU should introduce measures stimulating a development of European supply chains. An example of such measure could be a CBAM, by which EU would ensure the existence of its industry. This would shorten the supply chains and increase the security of EU\n1\nhttps://www.kobize.pl/en/page/id/409/about-us\n2 http://climatecake.pl/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CAKE_CL_Risk-of-CL_ENG.pdf 3 COM (2019) 640\n€ PGNiG\neconomy, which would also benefit development of solutions for transformation to climate neutral economy.\n5) IMPORTANCE OF EXISTING TOOLS\nIt is of key importance not to replace existing tools that prevent carbon leakage, but to complement them. The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU's climate policy and a key tool in helping it to achieve its objective of reducing GHG emissions. Auctioning is the general method for allocating emission allowances to companies that participate in the EU ETS. However, as an exception to that rule, the free allocation of emission allowances might be provided to well-defined industry sectors and subsectors as a safeguard measure against a significant risk of carbon leakage until comparable climate policy measures are undertaken by other countries. To address the risk of carbon leakage, pursuant to Article 10b of a Directive 2003/87/EC those sectors and subsectors are to receive free allowances at 100% of the quantity determined pursuant to Article 10a.\nMoreover, pursuant to Article 10a (6) of Directive 2003/87/EC, Member States are entitled to adopt financial measures in favour of sectors or subsectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to significant indirect costs that are actually incurred from GHG emission costs passed on in electricity prices.\nAbove mentioned measures are crucial, but not sufficient for EU industry to stay competitive globally. Abandoning these tools will result in unequal conditions for competition outside the European Union. EU companies willing to exports goods to third countries would still need to bear the cost of EU climate policy, while their competitors not. Therefore, we call for reinforcement through CBAM, rather than replacement of existing tools.\n6) PILOT CBAM\nDevelopment of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is challenging and several concepts are under consideration. Regardless of selected option, launching a pilot CBAM for one or several sectors exposed on carbon leakage risk would be reasonable. At first sectors most exposed to carbon leakage risk that experience significant decline of export of manufactured goods outside the European Union (as well as import of these goods to the EU) due to EU climate policy should be a subject to a CBAM measure (e.g. fertilizer industry).\nPGNiG S.A.

In the VIK’s view, the following aspects should be taken into account when designing new or improving existing policies aimed at reducing the risk of carbon leakage:\n\n• The European Commission should conduct a detailed impact assessment to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of a CBAM compared to other potential or existing policy instruments in preventing carbon leakage and to understand the impact that the introduction of a CBAM would have on stakeholders and value chains.\n\n• The analyses should be carried out in a transparent manner and with the close involvement of all stakeholders concerned. The VIK considers it necessary to establish a structured dialogue and cooperation between the European Commission and the industrial sector in order to examine the necessary regulatory and commercial framework. Given the complexity and interdependence of value chains and the wide divergence of economic and regulatory realities between EU Member States, this dialogue should also involve national industry associations and experts. As a cross-industry association, the VIK is happy to provide its expertise here.\n\n• The rising CO2 @-@ costs in the EU @-@ ETS and the resulting growing CO2 @-@ pricing gap with third countries make it urgent for the foreseeable future to further develop Europe’s carbon @-@ Leakage @-@ protection. In order to ensure this, existing policy measures in the short term, such as free allocation and compensation for indirect CO2 costs, need to be improved. We consider it important to build on the positive experience gained in the past with the existing toolkit.\n\n• In parallel, the Commission should fully consider complementing the existing instruments on carbon @-@ Leakage @-@ Protection and explore a CBAM and other alternative instruments and solutions (e.g. Carbon Contracts for Difference, CO2 @-@ levy on consumer goods to compensate for the additional costs and/or financing of CO2 @-@ neutral/low production processes of industry).

An assessment and a revision of current and new policy instruments are therefore needed to achieve the Green Deal’s objective of a decarbonized and competitive EU.\n\nIn order to incentivize industry decarbonisation, a sufficiently high carbon price will be required while avoiding carbon leakage and maintaining industrial production within the EU. Investments in low-carbon technologies should be rewarded by putting an adequate price on greenhouse gas emissions ($50-100/tCO2 by 2030 to achieve the Paris Agreement goals according to the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices). We therefore need a well-functioning EU ETS, while making sure that a high carbon price does not encourage a shift in emissions to other jurisdictions with no, or lower, carbon prices. \n\nEurima believes that a carbon border adjustment mechanism may be one possible option to create a level playing field for low-carbon products. Before preparing any legislative proposal, the feasibility of such a mechanism needs to be robustly analyzed through an in-depth impact assessment. This assessment should encompass a careful analysis of the mechanism’s functioning in relation to the existing climate and energy policy instruments. The following four principles should be kept in mind in the design of such a mechanism:\n\nFirstly, the overall objective of the mechanism, to help sustain and increase domestic climate ambition while also incentivizing other countries to take comparable action, needs to inform decisions on how a border measure is introduced. Retaliatory measures by third countries need to be avoided, for example by involving third countries in the process to determine whether these countries have taken comparable action. The first global stock-taking foreseen during COP26 could represent a first occasion to assess global climate policy developments.\n\nSecondly, we also encourage the Commission to analyse other types of instruments and policy options to help decarbonize industry and sustain production, demand and uptake of low-carbon products in the medium- and long-term. This can include targeted incentives for energy efficiency investments or instruments such as public procurement.\n\nThirdly, administrative complexity should be avoided as much as possible. In the reflection on the methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content of products, we recommend the European Commission to base its analysis on well-consolidated market practices, following EU and International Standards. For construction products, such an assessment needs to be based on Environmental Products Declarations (EN 15804 standard and its V2), which represents a worldwide reference with more than 7,300 construction products covered.\n\nFourthly, the carbon border adjustment should avoid competitive distortions, within and outside the EU. A fair and solid assessment of this matter is needed. \n\nEurima looks forward to exchange with the European Commission and other policymakers & stakeholders on the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism in Europe and other relevant instruments.",

It is crucial to include the possibility of amending the current EU ETS rules to accommodate the newly introduced instruments. A holistic approach to the revision of the carbon pricing policy framework allows more flexibility and better alignment of new and existing regulatory tools.\nIn our view, the Commission should consider the inclusion of consumption in the EU ETS via 1) introducing a climate contribution, i.e. a levy on the consumption of emission-intensive products based on the EU ETS product benchmarks, 2) strengthening the free allocation mechanism, i.e. introducing full dynamic allocation of free allowances and abandoning cross -sectoral correction factor. Combination of these two measures ensures that carbon pricing covers both production and use of emission-intensive products in the EU while providing a level playing field for the European producers.\nImpacts to be considered\nCBAM policy options need to be viewed from the perspective of broader climate policy goals achieved by the policy framework as a whole. These include:\nensuring that carbon price signal covers the whole value chain, i.e. both production and use of the emission-intensive basic materials, providing a predictable and credible regulatory framework for invest ments based in the EU. It should minimise the uncertainty related to the future evolution of such policy parameters as the level of emission benchmarks or differences in carbon taxation affecting domestic production and imports, raising revenue which can be used to support climate goals (e.g. funding development and early deployment of low-carbon industrial technologies, supporting just transition in carbon- intensive regions, scaling up international climate finance) as well as addressing distributional impacts of carbon pricing (e.g. reducing labour taxes or providing direct refunds to households), providing broadly defined incentives for scaling up global climate action. This includes not only putting direct pressure on the EU partners associated with border carbon taxes but also creating a robust regulatory framework to develop and commercialise affordable low-carbon industrial solutions. Furthermore, providing a regulatory blueprint which can be used by countries outside the EUto regulate their industrialemissions should alsobe considered as an important contribution to global climate action.\nIn our opinion, acombination of consumption-based levy and strengthened free allocation allows the EU to deliver a consistent and robust carbon pricing signal for the production and use of industrial goods in a way which can be sustained over an extended time without compromising the competitiveness of European industry or risking the international trade conflict.

        "feedback": "Carbon Market Watch fully supports efforts to price GHG emissions, within and outside the EU. The EU ETS has been successful for certain sectors, but has failed to incentivise large scale decarbonisation of European industry, in part because of its excessive measures to guard against the hypothetical risk of carbon leakage. Industrial companies have gained billions of euros in windfall profits from the EU ETS, due to the free allocation of allowances, despite the fact that there has never been - and it is unlikely there will ever be - any significant risk of carbon leakage from the EU ETS.\nGiven this, neither the free allocation of allowances nor a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) are necessary tools for climate action. However, a CBAM is preferable to free allocation as a CBAM ensures that polluters pay for their emissions. The European Commission should also consider alternative policy options in its impact assessment including the implementation of carbon emission performance standards for energy-intensive materials and creating markets for zero-carbon solutions through public procurement. If a CBAM is to be introduced, we consider the following prerequisites and design elements necessary.\nFirst, all forms of free allocation and cost compensation schemes should be fully and immediately phased out under the ETS. Under no circumstances should free allocation and CBAM co-exist, as this would result in double protection against a risk which is unlikely to materialise in the first place.\nSecond, the CBAM should be designed in a way that incentivises other countries to take more ambitious climate action, rather than as a punishment mechanism for climate laggards. This requires that pathways be identified to inform other countries how their industries can be exempted from CBAM obligations, e.g. if they adopt carbon pricing measures in line with the Paris Agreement’s objective of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C°.\nThird, in respect of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States should be exempted from CBAM obligations. In addition, all revenues should be allocated to climate action, with a majority disbursed in the form of climate grants to developing countries.\nFourth, a CBAM should be implemented through a benchmark system. However, the benchmark values should not be the same as those used under the ETS. While ETS benchmarks are set at the level of the 10% best performers in order to incentivise companies to reach that threshold, using the same values would have the exact opposite impact in the context of a CBAM. This would be equivalent to assuming that imports have been produced with the same level of emissions as the 10% best performers in the EU. No value lower than the average carbon intensity of a product manufactured in Europe should be used. Companies wishing to sell goods on the European market should also be allowed to provide evidence that their product is less carbon intensive than the benchmark, and benefit from a lower CBAM obligation accordingly.\nFifth, while the most straightforward way of implementing a CBAM would be through a tariff measure, this is likely to be the most politically difficult implementation strategy, both inside and outside the EU. A more realistic avenue would be to rely on the existing infrastructure of the EU ETS and require importers to purchase EUAs to cover their CBAM obligations. These EUAS would be taken directly from the amount already set for the future, without any changes to the cap.\nWe recommend that only cement, steel, chemicals and power be covered by the CBAM mechanism, as these are the highest sources of emissions under the ETS, and emissions embedded in imports from these sectors are estimated to be around 8% of annual emissions covered by the EU ETS. Given the massive oversupply of allowances on the market, there is no need to adjust the cap to account for this.",
        "pdf_text": "Carbon Border Adjustments: Climate Protection or Climate Protectionism?\nCarbon Market Watch Position paper - March 2020\nIntroducing Carbon Border Adjustments in the EU\nPricing greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most important tools to decarbonise economies, and it has been implemented in the EU since 2005 through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). As part of this policy, the heavy industry benefits from large exemptions and receives nearly all of its allowances (i.e. pollution permits) for free. This has led to significant windfall profits for companies’ and is tantamount to subsidising pollution. The free allocation is supposed to prevent so-called “carbon leakage”, a hypothetical concern according to which companies will relocate their production from the EU if they are faced with excessive carbon prices domestically.\nThere is no evidence of carbon leakage having taken place due to climate policies such as the EU ETS, and ex-ante theoretical predictions have found a very limited risk in the future, materialising (theoretically) only at very high carbon prices. Therefore, free allocation should be fully phased out. Moreover, while the power sector, which must purchase its allowances, has decarbonised steadily year after the year, industrial emissions have stagnated since 2012’.\nAs part of the EU Green Deal, the European Commission is considering a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to reduce the risk of carbon leakage, as an alternative to the existing measures under the EU ETS’. This implies it would allow a phase-out of free allocation.\nGiven the lack of evidence to support the theoretical risk of carbon leakage, neither the free\nallocation of pollution permits nor a CBAM are necessary tools for climate action.

If a CBAM is to be introduced, the following prerequisites and design elements are necessary:\n1) All forms of free allocation under the EU ETS are phased out completely and rapidly\nMaintaining free allocation, at any level, while introducing BCAs would mean protecting industries twice against a risk which has never materialised, and which is unlikely to materialise in the foreseeable future.\nIt would discriminate against foreign imports while continuing to hand out massive subsidies to large European polluters. In order to incentivise emission reductions within the EU, a CBAM would have to be a tool to fully and rapidly phase out free allocation. This would ensure that EU industry is finally paying for its carbon pollution. As a co-benefit, this will raise revenues that can be used to support climate innovation and just transition.\n2) A CBAM proposal is used as a tool for international climate\ndiplomacy\nA CBAM could help strengthen the EU’s attempts to encourage and pressure other countries, in particular large emitters, into adopting and implementing more stringent climate targets.\nThis requires a clear set of rules to decide which imports will and will not be covered by a CBAM, and to encourage third countries to adopt climate policies that are stringent enough to ensure that their exports will not be restricted by the EU’s pricing initiative.\nThese policies should include national climate pledges (NDCs) that are in-line with the Paris Agreement’s objective, carbon pricing systems that are similar in stringency to the EU ETS, or other sectoral or economy-wide policies which lead to emission reductions in line with the country’s fair share and historical responsibility in order to limit global warming below 1.5°C.\n3) The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and\nrespective capabilities (CBDR-RC) as established by the Paris\nAgreement are respected\nWhile implementing a CBAM, the EU should recognise other countries’s need to develop, as\nwell as the relative impacts of carbon prices, which can be much higher for low-income\ncountries.\nFor this reason, Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) should be exempted from any BCAs. In addition, the revenues collected from a CBAM should be allocated in full to climate action, with a majority of it distributed to developing countries in the form of climate finance contributions.\nFurthermore, only the largest emitting industrial sectors should be covered by a CBAM, as products from these sectors are less likely to be traded with LDCs and SIDS.\n4) The CBAM is based on carbon performance benchmarks\nThe compliance costs should be determined on the basis of a benchmark system’.\nEach product should be priced according to a performance benchmark reflecting the carbon intensity of the average EU producer of that good. To ensure that a CBAM still provides an incentive to decarbonise, non-EU producers should be allowed to demonstrate that their product is less carbon-intensive than the carbon performance benchmark which, after third-party verification, would result in a lower compliance cost under the EU CBAM system.\nInitially, only steel, cement and chemicals should be covered by a CBAM, as these three sectors account for almost 60% of industrial emissions under the EU ETS. Furthermore, the power sector should be included to prevent high carbon imports of electricity from neighbouring countries.\n* A benchmark is default value of the carbon intensity of good, i.e. to produce unit of good (e.g. a a one a one tonne of steel) a certain quantity of greenhouse gases is emitted (e.g. 10 tonnes of CO2e).\nae\n5) The CBAM is implemented through the requirement to use EU\nallowances\nSetting up a border tariff would be the most straightforward route to implement a CBAM.\nHowever, it is also the most sensitive implementation strategy when it comes to the political\nreality of European and international negotiations. For example, EU decision-making requires\nunanimity for taxation matters.\nTherefore, the EU should implement a CBAM by requiring companies wishing to import products in the EU to purchase EU allowances (EUAs). The EUAs would be cancelled immediately when a product enters the EU single market (as opposed to on an annual basis). The total cap of EUAs set should not be modified to account for this, given the relatively small amount of embedded emissions in imports of steel’, cement, chemicals and power, and given that the EU ETS is currently significantly oversupplied.\nIn order to promote transparency, EUAs surrendered under the CBAM should be uniquely\nidentifiable and traceable in a publicly accessible registry.\n° Embodied CO2 emissions from steel and cement imported to the EU in 2016 respectively around were Z0Mt and 1Mt. For electricity imports, the value was at 26Mt in 2019. Data on embedded emissions in chemical imports is not available but we conservatively estimate it to be less than 50 Mt (based on the fact that emissions from chemical productions in the EU are around 115Mt, and EU sales are about 5 times higher than the value of imported chemicals). Together, these would amount to 147 Mt, or around 8% of total annual emissions under the EU ETS in 2018.\n4\naaa\nShould European exports benefit from rebates?\nThere should be no rebates for exports, as this would lower the carbon price effectively faced by European industries and risks to create perverse incentives. Carbon should be priced regardless of the market on which a product is sold. However, should rebates be adopted, the following conditions should be met:\n1. Dirty and cleaner exports should not face the same final level of carbon costs and must therefore receive the same level of rebates. This way, more polluting goods will face a higher cost, because the carbon cost is based on the actual carbon content of products, while the rebate is based on the carbon efficiency of the cleanest producers. By using product-based benchmarks set on the basis of the most-efficient producers (as is done for free allocation under the EU ETS) exports that are less carbon intensive than the benchmark would be net-beneficiaries of the rebates, while exports that are dirtier than the benchmark would not receive a rebate for their full carbon\ncost.\n2.\na system was on and it should be applied after the company has paid the carbon cost. The latter point is important, as it is necessary to ensure that a company faces the full extent of the carbon price before applying the rebate. Otherwise, this is tantamount to free allocation under the EU ETS which leads to windfall profits and, in practice, clearly reduces the effectiveness of the system.\nTherefore, if rebates\nadopted, it should be based benchmarks,\nContact\nSam Van den plas - Policy Director sam.vandenplas@carbonmarketwatch.org\nAgnese Ruggiero - Policy Officer\nagnese.ruggiero@carbonmarketwatch.org"

The ambitious vision of a climate-neutral continent can only be achieved with a strong, low-emission European steel industry and robust industrial value-added networks that will secure prosperity and jobs in Europe and achieve the climate goals through innovation.\nThe steel industry is indispensable for Europe as a business location and must be preserved and cultivated sustainably within the framework of the location policy. However, the downstream processing stages - such as the steel and metal processing industry - and other players in the supply chain have become more important in recent decades in terms of the number of jobs and economic importance and must be supported just as effectively in the transformation process.\nClimate protection is a task for all states. A globally coordinated, high level of ambition in climate protection can create globally comparable competitive conditions for industry. It is not yet foreseeable that such a level playing field can be achieved in the medium term, not even at the level of the G20 states. For this reason, the President of the EU Commission announced in connection with the presentation of her Green Deal for Europe on 11 December 2019 that she would \"propose a CO2 border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors in order to reduce the risk of carbon leakage\"’. The system should ensure that import prices better reflect the cost of CO2.\nAccording to WSM, comprehensive border adjustment measures could, under certain conditions, be suitable to compensate competitive disadvantages that EU companies face due to high climate protection standards. The risk of energy-intensive industries or production migrating to regions with lower climate protection standards (carbon leakage) must be prevented at all costs. However, it must be ensured that free and rule-based world trade, which is vital for the survival of the export-oriented European industry, is not disturbed. Border adjustment measures must therefore comply with WTO rules and retaliatory measures by important trading partners must be ruled out.\n* European Commission: \"COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS\", Brussels, 11.12.2019, page 6\nBorder adjustment measures must cover the entire value chain\nBorder adjustment measures must take into account and include the entire value-added chain and flow of goods. It is not sufficient and would lead to distortions if only the raw materials at the beginning of the value chains were protected from international competition. WSM therefore strongly supports the French proposal, which provides for a border charge on all goods containing emission-intensive materials and also includes a relief for the export of these goods.\nMaintaining the competitiveness of the steel and metal processing industries in Europe\nWith material costs accounting for approx. 60% of total costs, the steel and metal processing industry is compulsory dependent on both competitive input material prices and competitive European input material suppliers. Restricting the border adjustment mechanism solely to the import of raw materials such as steel or aluminium would have a negative impact on the competitiveness of the processing stages in Europe due to the political increase in import prices - and thus also due to the increase in the price of raw materials produced in Europe - and would lead to an investment and job leakage.\nCompanies in third countries would also be encouraged to process the steel in their own country and then deliver into the EU the finished or semi-finished products to which no border adjustment is applied and which are oftentimes polluted with higher COz emissions. European manufacturers would thus have only limited access to steel imports from third countries and would come under increasing import and competitive pressure for their own products manufactured within the EU. In order to obtain raw materials without COz costs, these companies could in future be forced to relocate their production and the associated added value and jobs outside the EU.\nLast but not least, customers of the processing industry could be encouraged to relocate their production to third countries in order to avoid the cost disadvantages in input materials. Many European customers of the steel and metal processing industry, such as the automotive and mechanical engineering industries, already produce in third countries and could expand these locations.\nPetitum\nThe steel and metal processing industry calls for a comprehensive protection of competition in the event of the introduction of a border adjustment mechanism, which includes all processing stages of emission- intensive materials. This is the only way to prevent the risk of carbon leakage shifting to the downstream processing stages and to ensure the protection of jobs and companies in the value chains of steel and metal processing. Protection only for selected sectors would be clearly inadequate.\nIn addition, alternatives to a tariff-reinforced border adjustment mechanism (e.g. tax incentives) should be presented and a comprehensive impact assessment of the CBAM should be carried out before it is implemented."

In this regard, the EEA would like to suggest the following points to be considered and added to the impact assessment:\n\n1.\tDepending on the policy instrument, a CBAM could generate additional and cumbersome processes at the border, potentially leading to impact on operators (such as EEA members) supporting global supply chains of companies and taking care of customs’ processes and declarations. This would trigger more complexity and less transparency for EU customers and importers. To ensure a more simple and transparent process, calculation and/or collection of the CBAM should occur at the time of sales, not at the border. We would like to suggest including avoidance of the potential impact on border processes and operators in the impact analysis.\n2.\tUnder “likely impact on simplification and/or administrative burden” and “likely economic impacts”, the potential impact on SMEs should also be analyzed in the impact assessment.\n",

Protection against carbon leakage must therefore be a key component of industrial and climate policy. \n\n• The EU steel industry is particularly vulnerable to carbon leakage due to strong international competition. From a prospective point of view, this risk is greatly increased by increasing costs from the ETS. In particular in the fourth trading period of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the steel industry faces significant under-allocations of allowances. \n\n• In order to avoid carbon leakage, priority is given to existing preventive measures such as free allocation of allowances. Border adjustment should at most complement these, but should not replace them. Border adjustment should therefore only be considered if conventional carbon leakage is no longer sufficient to avoid serious disadvantages in international competition resulting from the ETS. \n\n• A border adjustment must be WTO @-@ compliant. This means, in particular, that at the border there is only compensation for the costs that European providers also have to bear through the ETS, thus avoiding discrimination. CO2 costs incurred by foreign suppliers in their home country must also be taken into account. This also creates incentives to avoid CO2 in third countries.\n\n• Border equalisation is not an instrument that would directly promote a transformation towards CO2 @-@ poor steelmaking. Rather, during the transition phase, it serves to avoid a premature shutdown of conventional CO2-intensive processes in the EU. However, revenues from border adjustment can be used to support the transformation and thus facilitate the transition to low-carbon steel production.\n\n• The steel industry in Germany welcomes the fact that the European Commission is currently examining the possibility of introducing a border adjustment. However, if border adjustment is introduced, it must also be designed in such a way as to effectively avoid carbon leakage. Under no circumstances should this instrument entail the prospect of abolishing the free allocation of allowances or of waiving full electricity price compensation.",

        "feedback": "essenscia agrees that an effective carbon leakage protection tailored to the effective carbon cost burden on competing industries in the rest of the world is crucial in the fight against climate change.   The chosen carbon leakage measures need to provide carbon leakage protection for products on the EU market as well as for products intended to export. The EU ETS, with its free allocation principle and indirect cost compensation framework until 2030, is an appropriate tool for mitigating domestic GHG emissions of the EU industry and providing carbon leakage protection. Any future measures would therefore need to be as effective as the EU ETS free allocation and indirect compensation system both for importing and exporting sectors, while avoiding any retaliation risks on industry.\n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is a trade-restrictive instrument which entails risks of possible unintended and far-reaching consequences especially for exporting sectors. Unless complemented by offsets of carbon cost for exporting sectors, such mechanism does not provide carbon leakage protection for export: as non-EU companies do not have to pay for their CO2 emission for products sold in their home market, the EU-company cannot pass on its EU-ETS CO2 costs to exported products delivered to non-EU consumers. Without carbon leakage protection by free allocation and indirect compensation, EU producers will lose market share outside the EU.  Moreover, there is a risk of retaliation action by non-EU countries, again affecting the exporting sectors. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to assess whether a CBAM is needed, desirable and feasible over the longer term and which instrument at the border or at end consumer level could address unequal climate cost burden the best for the EU as net exporting continent. In this framework, essenscia requests an in-depth reflection on carbon pricing policies in general and on all possible policy options that would help mitigate carbon and investment leakage for exposed industries. Such system should focus on a carbon signal in production and consumption. \n\nWe do agree that the CBAM should align with the EU’s trade acquis, and should be WTO compatible. The EU will remain open to and depend upon international free and fair trade and will have to engage in dialogue with its trading partners in order to avoid trade conflicts. In case the CBAM is not applied to finished goods due to the complexity of the model but more to upstream goods of activities, it will be important for the impact assessment to calculate the estimated increased costs of the CBAM throughout the value chain, and whether this in turn would result in an increased import of finished goods in Europe. Moreover, our industry is a net exporter and therefore any new system should reinforce EU’s strengths in the global chemical industry as well as downstream value chains. The system should be balanced for import and export and should therefore foresee a rebate for exported goods. Limiting the CBAM to a selection of sectors will distort the level the playing field within EU-ETS (when applying a CSCF) and could on top lead to possible retaliation measures that will affect non-concerned sectors. \n\nAny chosen option should not unnecessarily increase compliance costs or add administrative burden for the chemical and life sciences industry as well as competent authorities. There is currently no system in place neither in the EU nor at global level to determine and compare the carbon footprint of domestic and foreign products and/or producers. A robust monitoring, reporting and verification will need to be established ensuring legal certainty and equal treatment of international competitors.\n",

We oppose the introduction of CBA because it is unlikely to be an effective global warming countermeasure commensurate with such the risk.\nFrom the viewpoint of the steel industry’s measures against global warming, CBA will only impose an economic burden equal in legislative requirement to that in the EU on steel products imported from outside of the EU and may not facilitate actual CO2 emission reduction such as improving the efficiency of steel production equipment in exporters. Of course, countries that do not export to the EU have no influence.\nIn the Inception Impact Assessment, “the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism, for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage.” is described. Even if the mechanism is introduced in the steel industry and as a result, the export of steel products from third countries and regions to the EU decreases and steel manufacturers in the EU can produce steel to make up for the decrease, but the amount of steel produced by them is around 44 million tons/year (actual figures of the EU’s import from outside the EU in 2018) which is only 2.4% of a world crude steel production of approximately 1.8 billion tons, which is very far from the solution for global warming mitigation. On the contrary, as a result of the limited production of these exporters, CBA may eat into the exporters’ financial resources allocated for the introduction and development of technologies for CO2 emission reduction and even have the adverse effect of hindering the progress of measures taken by them in countries and regions concerned.\nThe key of global warming countermeasures lies in technology. Effective measures backed by technology are indispensable, rather than CBA that may cause adverse effects such as trade friction.\nIf the EC’s true aim is to promote measures against global warming, it is important in the short or medium term to improve energy efficiency in the steel industry on a global scale by applying best available technologies (BATs) in energy saving and CO2 emission reduction that have already been put into practical use to facilities in operation and facilities that are to be newly established or added. And at the same time, it is important to contribute in the development and practical realization of innovative low/zero-carbon technologies for the future.\nRegarding the implementation of BATs, the “2-Degree Scenario (SDS)” in the IEA’s WEO 2018 recommends that a total of US$ 16 trillion needs to be invested for introduction of BATs in the world from 2018 to 2040, and it is recognized as urgent and executable challenge.\nSteel production will grow not in the EU but in Asian regions including India and ASEAN countries, where population and economic growth is expected. The effort to the implementation of technologies for energy saving and CO2 emission reduction to these countries and regions will be the key to the steel industry’s measures against global warming.\nThe Japanese steel industry has engaged in activities to promote the spread of BATs such as coke dry-quenching (CDQ) and blast furnace top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT) to the world. The global CO2 emission reduction effect due to the spread of such key energy saving facilities reached 65 million tons per year as of 2018. We are promoting such activities with its counterparts in India and ASEAN countries through governmental and private-sector workshops etc. to reduce CO2 emissions by the spread of BATs.\nWe believe that developing innovative technologies and spreading BATs to developing countries are important missions as an environmentally advanced nation, and will continue to expand these efforts in the future.",

This debate is essential in the context of preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policies as well as the competitiveness of European industry.\n\nPreventing carbon leakage and its impacts\n\nThe power sector already observes problems of carbon leakage. Data available show that 21 TWh of coal-based electricity has been imported to the EU in 2019.

However, we recognise the need to address the increasing carbon leakage risk for the ETS-related industries in the context of greater climate ambition. Therefore, Eurelectric supports the ongoing European Commission work on assessing carbon border adjustment mechanism focused on environmental integrity and competitiveness. The power sector observes increased cross-border power trading and imports from third countries with high carbon content, requiring the investigation of a carbon border adjustment mechanism. As a result, electricity-intensive producers covered by the EU ETS as well as others outside its scope could be negatively impacted. An impact assessment needs to analyse the respective effects on the power market and the overall compatibility of the mechanism in relation to its scope and coverage. Designing criteria for carbon border adjustment mechanisms would need to be workable and in compliance with international agreements, while at the same time raising mitigation efforts in third countries. Additionally, ensuring fairness could foresee a part of the derived funds being earmarked for green power generation projects in third countries. Ultimately, the solution to prevent carbon leakage in the power sector would be a more global carbon pricing. Greater collaboration with other regions is essential and climate diplomacy will play a key role. Eurelectric supports the European Commission for engaging the international community with ambitious carbon pricing policy frameworks.\n1. Addressing the structural problem of carbon leakage\nThe European Green Deal has put forward a proposal for a border adjustment for ‘selected sectors’ aiming at import of carbon intensive products. The path to reaching climate neutrality in 2050 requires a toolbox of policy solutions, notably in view of the risks for carbon leakage.\nEurelectric recognises the need to address the impact of carbon leakage in industries which engage in global or cross-border competition with third countries and this has to be carefully evaluated and addressed at EU level. The power sector itself is already affected as seen in the cases of fossil fuels based electricity imports along the EU external borders to the Baltic states, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Poland and Spain.\nIn 2019 alone, 33 TWh of electricity (21 TWh of which coal-based) has been imported to the EU ETS region.\" This imported electricity is not subject to carbon pricing and has in most cases a lower cost (and price) than domestically produced electricity in the importing Member States, resulting in carbon import distorting competition and impacting EU-based generators negatively. Electricity- intensive producers covered by the EU ETS as well as others outside its scope could in turn be negatively impacted. As Europe takes global leadership in addressing climate change, European industry must be able to compete while knowing that investing in decarbonisation efforts is a no- regret decision.\nEurelectric’s view is that the Green Deal should include ambitious international dimension. In addition, the EU should promote mechanisms to make domestic producers more carbon efficient while at the same time encourage third countries to become more climate friendly. Europe should put forward complementary policies and tools with the ultimate goal of developing a more global carbon price and market, making it unnecessary to rely on applying potentially perilous unilateral carbon border adjustments in the long term. In this context, climate diplomacy will play a key role to engage the international community with ambitious climate policy frameworks.\nTo prevent placing European industry at a disadvantage in the meantime and keep the carbon price signal to decarbonise efficiently, we have looked at key requirements for the effective design of carbon border measures in order to improve environmental integrity and competitiveness aspects of EU climate policies.\n2. Policy objectives\nAhead of setting design parameters for tackling carbon leakage, the following policy objectives must be met in developing a carbon border adjustment mechanism:\nv Ensure level playing field for the European industry on the European market and abroad v Enhance the effectiveness of the EU ETS by preventing carbon leakage v Raise mitigation efforts outside Europe by promoting introduction of carbon pricing systems in third countries v Achieve measures in the most cost-efficient and socially acceptable manner v Maintain full compliance with WTO and Energy Charter treaty principles\n1 The path of least resistance, Sandbag, 2019\nv Preserve full consistency with UNFCCC principles (“common and differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”)\n3. Scope and coverage\nThe European Commission should carry out an impact assessment regarding the scope and coverage of different sectors in the context of a carbon border adjustment.\nThe power sector is likely to be considered as the EU power markets are already exposed to carbon leakage. A carbon border adjustment would be easier to design for the power sector than for other internationally traded goods because calculating the carbon emissions for electricity generation is relatively straightforward. Mitigating carbon leakage for the energy-intensive sectors’ could require different design and solutions.\n4. Options to implement a carbon border adjustment mechanism in the power sector\nThere are several options for implementing a carbon border adjustment. The options are not mutually exclusive, as different mechanisms could be applied in parallel in respect of different third countries. The ideal outcome would be that the third country implements equivalent carbon pricing, so that border adjustment is not required.\nImplementation of a carbon border adjustment for the power sector would therefore be a two stage process:\nStage One: Check if equivalent carbon pricing is applied (or will be applied) in the third country, as this largely removes the need for a carbon border adjustment. Carbon pricing can be applied through a carbon trading scheme (the most robust option is to link this to the EU ETS) or a carbon tariff.\nThis is an important stage to ensure full compliance with the WTO rules and show there is no arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against jurisdictions with carbon pricing. In case of imports from jurisdictions with carbon pricing, carbon border adjustments need to be modified and take into account the already paid carbon price in the third country. Moreover, the availability of an emission cap needs to be considered as well as any implications derived from the existence of EU’s Market Stability Reserve.\nAdditionally, offering the removal of the carbon border adjustment if equivalent carbon pricing is applied would provide an incentive for the adoption of stronger decarbonisation measures in third states.\nStage Two: If equivalent carbon pricing is not currently possible, then a carbon border adjustment can be applied and ways forward include:\n2 Based the significance of their carbon intensity well electricity intensity of production, example sectors on as as are: steel, chemicals, cement, aluminium.\ne Carbon ‘involvement’ mechanism\nAn alternative solution to a tariff is to link the market participation of importers to the same conditions as domestic producers who pay a price on carbon. If importers are made subject to the EU ETS, then the impacts on the operation of the EU ETS must be managed (for example, by a separate category of allowance for the importers). To ensure balance and avoid protectionist measures, the mechanism should create an own envelope where a part of the derived funds are earmarked for green power generation projects in the third countries.\nThe separate category of allowances for importers (that are issued on demand at the current EUA price) is effectively a tariff, but the level varies automatically with the traded EU ETS price. The reason for creating a separate category is to avoid impacts on the operation of the EU ETS itself. If importers of goods are involved in the ETS and entitled to purchase ETS allowances, whilst this is convenient, it could have unforeseen and unpredictable impacts on the EU ETS supply-demand balance and resulting impacts on carbon price. The risks to EU ETS stability are likely to outweigh the convenience of using an existing mechanism, so this issue would need to be thoroughly assessed.\nThe European Commission needs to set clear conditions under which carbon trading scheme in third countries could be linked to the EU ETS. Green trade agreements can enable this option.\ne A new generation of EU Green Trade Deals\nIncluding effective climate provisions in trade agreements can potentially provide a much-needed counterbalance to the negative climate aspects of distortions through trade. The EU could leverage its ability to conclude bilateral trade deals with partners and help level the regulatory playing field. This approach should remain consistent with possible adoption of other carbon pricing measures by third countries.\nAn example is the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which obliged the creation of a national ETS fit to link with the European system. This approach appears to be a logical alternative at EU’s borders, where Contracting Parties to the Energy Community Treaty are protected from a direct carbon border tariff. In this sense, developing a carbon pricing mechanism at the level of the Energy Community is a logical step.\nIssue linkages between trade and climate can also stimulate discussions for implementation of carbon reduction projects under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and/or implementation and linking of ETS systems in third countries.\nAnother option on a multilateral scale would be to open negotiations in the WTO in order to set up standards of carbon clean products and allow the specific treatment of carbon content in the technical regulations. This could be based on incorporating climate change as environmental challenge in the WTO rules.\ne WTO compliance\nCarbon border adjustments are technically feasible and legally compatible with GATT and WTO rules, provided they are designed in the right way. The key assessment criteria to ensure compliance with international trade rules are proportionality, fairness and transparency. Article XX of GATT allows the adoption of policies that are incompatible with WTO rules but necessary to protect on health reasons. What is more, the Montreal Protocol has already set a relevant precedent as it implemented trade restrictions on ozone depleting substances, and in turn preventing leakage and encouraging broad international cooperation.*\n5. Concluding remarks\nThe EU has to ensure the competitiveness of European companies exposed to global competition This does not concern only industry, but also the power sector. Cross-border power trading between EU Member States and third countries is expected to increase and potentially resulting in increasing carbon leakage risks.\nThe primary solution to prevent carbon leakage is a more global carbon pricing. Collaboration with other regions is crucial in order to promote and implement ambitious climate policies and especially develop international carbon markets. At the same time, various options to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism for power sector should be investigated. Such a mechanism would incentivize low-carbon electricity generation and respective investments in neighbouring countries and the spread of meaningful carbon pricing.\n3 Climate-linked tariffs and subsidies, WTO\nEurelectric pursues in all its activities the application of the\nfollowing sustainable development values:\nEconomic Development\nGrowth, added-value, efficiency\na\nEnvironmental Leadership\nL Commitment, innovation, pro-activeness\nSocial Responsibility\nL Transparency, ethics, accountability\neurelectric\nUnion of the Electricity Industry - Eurelectric aisbl Boulevard de |’Ilmpératrice, 66 — bte 2 - 1000 Brussels, Belgium Tel: +32 25151000 - VAT: BE 0462 679 112 © www.eurelectric.org EU Transparency Register number: 4271427696-87"

All carbon border adjustment proposals rely on some degree of assessment of the carbon intensity of the electricity. This inevitably introduces a significant administrative burden on all flows of electricity, whether they are zero-carbon or from the most polluting forms. These measures typically rely on some form of national measure of carbon intensity together with exemptions for products for lower than average carbon intensities. This means that the most burdensome regulations to prove eligibility for exemptions fall upon the lowest carbon intensity products. The changing nature of the electricity market, in particular the increasing proportion of weather dependent variable generation from wind and solar, means such carbon intensity varies significantly, and this – rather than a simple average would need to be taken into account.\n\nSuch an administrative burden will disincentivise the cross-border trade in low carbon intensity products. As a result, low carbon products could be replaced with higher carbon intensity imports (the most carbon intensive products which pay a carbon border adjustment on only the lower national average measure will perversely benefit the most) or by higher intensity EU production. This cannot be to the benefit of EU consumers or the EU’s efforts against climate change.\n\nNext Steps\n\nWe agree that a detailed examination of a border carbon tax adjustment should be taken forward.\n\nWe would suggest that the following key principles are followed:\n\n• Border carbon adjustments must accurately define the carbon content of the import, recognising all of the potential variations in carbon content;\n\n• Border carbon adjustments must not present an undue administrative burden on imports and especially low carbon imports such that any perceived benefits in carbon reduction are outweighed;\n\n• Border Carbon Adjustments should not act to “skew” domestic markets against cross-border trade\n\n• The efficacy of a border carbon adjustment in reducing carbon emissions in the producing nation must be assessed accurately prior to implementation.\n\nA more detailed reply to support our ideas has been added in the file attached.

This means that the most burdensome regulations to prove eligibility for exemptions fall upon the lowest carbon intensity products. The changing nature of the electricity market, in particular the increasing proportion of weather dependent variable generation from wind and solar, means such carbon intensity varies significantly, and this — rather than a simple average would need to be taken into account.\nSuch an administrative burden will disincentivise the cross-border trade in low carbon intensity products. As a result, low carbon products could be replaced with higher carbon intensity imports (the most carbon intensive products which pay a carbon border adjustment on only the lower national average measure will perversely benefit the most) or by higher intensity EU production. This cannot be to the benefit of EU consumers or the EU’s efforts against climate change.\nNext Steps\nWe agree that a detailed examination of a border carbon tax adjustment should be taken forward.\nWe would suggest that the following key principles are followed:\ne Border carbon adjustments must accurately define the carbon content of the import, recognising all of the potential variations in carbon content; Border carbon adjustments must not present an undue administrative burden on imports and especially low carbon imports such that any perceived benefits in carbon reduction are outweighed; Border Carbon Adjustments should not act to “skew” domestic markets against cross-border trade The efficacy of a border carbon adjustment in reducing carbon emissions in the producing nation must be assessed accurately prior to implementation.\n1 Of this capacity, approximately half is operational. The remainder is under construction with all capacity expected to be operational by 2024.\nDifficulties with border carbon adjustments\nCarbon taxation is a complex issue. The most successful mechanisms such as the EU ETS area tax on production levied on emitters of carbon. This leads to the issue identified in the Impact Assessment that producers outside of the EU do not then face the same taxation, potentially disadvantaging domestic producers and/or “offshoring” carbon emissions rather than eliminating them.\nCarbon taxes on consumption are very difficult to establish due to the immense complexities in determining how much carbon has been emitted, directly or indirectly, during their production. However carbon border adjustments necessarily have to operate on this basis. The issue is then one of how does one accurately estimate the carbon content, and in such a way that it does not discriminate between the same imported good with different levels of carbon content or indeed between goods imported and those produced nationally.\nEnergy as a case study\nEnergy is assumed to be a relatively straightforward commodity on which to apply a “consumption” tax at the border. International efforts to do so have been proven to be difficult to implement (California and Quebec are notable examples of where some limited progress has been made).\nThis is simply because while an “average” value of electricity carbon intensity could be determined this is subject to very significant variations. In the UK for example the carbon intensity of electricity varies hugely depending on the wind and solar conditions, and the level of demand.\nIt is complicated still further by the fact that exported energy may not be in any way representative of a national average. Exports may be driven by surplus renewables. Exports could be of contracted energy only from zero carbon resources. Exports may even have originated in another country entirely. However this is completely unaccounted for by a “national” measure of carbon intensity.\nAs a consequence it is necessary to derive complex accounting techniques for border carbon adjustments to ensure that lower-carbon imports are not unfairly penalised.\nAdditionally for commodities such as electricity that are traded many times over before being supplied to an end consumer there is little chance of a price signal from a border carbon tax being passed back to a specific high carbon intensity producer. It may be that higher costs of exports from a producer nation will potentially reduce gross exports. This will mean production is scaled back, but at the marginal producer. For countries with weaker national carbon taxation policies the marginal producer may not be the most carbon intensive. It could be the case that less carbon intense production is curtailed in response to lower export opportunities increasing that countries production carbon intensity still further.\nCreating a level playing field\nIt is often argued that there is a need to create a level playing field between domestic and other producers of energy.\nBecause there is a need for a complex system of carbon accounting with a carbon border adjustment this in turn creates an unlevel playing field skewed against cross border trade. Such trade, including if it is low carbon trade, faces far greater administrative barriers under a border carbon adjustment than domestic producers. Arguably such barriers could dwarf any perception of an unlevel playing field for domestic providers under the existing framework."

Energy-intensive industries such as cement, lime and steel are key industrial chains for the European economy, and their pathway towards net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be technically and economically challenging. \n\nCCS and CCU technologies can help support a just transition for its citizens and regions, allowing for a cost-efficient and environmentally safe decarbonisation pathway while maintaining productivity and competitiveness across European industries, creating new jobs and preserving existing ones. However, a range of technological, policy and regulatory measures will need to be put in place for the European Union to meet its climate objectives. \n\nThe European Union will need to ensure that a transition to a low-carbon economy in a cost-efficient way. Europe has technological solutions that will need to be urgently deployed and scaled up to create a European CO2 transport and storage infrastructure. With European storage sites, European CO2 transport and storage infrastructure and European workforce, the industrial transition can be done. The large-scale deployment of technologies such as CCS and CCU will need to be supported through an adequate policy and regulatory framework, addressing the shortcomings of the existing legislation. \n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism – important to achieve a level playing field and decrease the risk of carbon leakage.\n\nIn absence of a global price for carbon and until countries align on climate ambitions, a carbon border adjustment mechanism will be needed in the European Union to achieve a level playing field between European and international producers. Such a carbon border adjustment mechanism could decrease the risk of carbon leakage in key industrial value chains and support their decarbonisation pathway. \n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism should be designed to comply with the EU’s trade agreements, as well as Wold Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, and in a manner which works seamlessly with the climate legislation it aims to adjust for. Accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in this respect.  \n\nThe current EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) has not yet been aligned with the target of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. When revised, it will be crucial to ensure a functioning cap and trade system that delivers an adequate carbon price. In parallel, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) must be adjusted to the same level of ambition, so that same conditions are applied to all actors and society as a whole.  \n\nTo incentivise investments in R&I, pilot projects and demonstration projects, there is a need for an effective carbon price which support and develops European industrial and technological leadership on low-carbon technologies such as CCS and CCU. \n\nTo summarise, a carbon border adjustment mechanism may ultimately lead towards a low-carbon European industrial sector, supporting the European Union’s pathway towards net-zero by 2050. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Montenegro, as a country heavily dependent on coal energy production, is therefore depend on the only thermal power plant it has, located in Pljevlja Municipality – responsible for the major economic, environmental and social issues that Montenegro is facing. \nEven though Montenegro introduced cap and trade system for main CO2 emitters, following the adoption of Law on Protection from the negative impacts of climate change, planned free allowances referring only to the Montenegrin NDC from 2017, with the 1990s baseline, which is insufficiently ambitious. Most of the free allowances are planned for the Pljevlja plant. This year NDC will be revised, hence making the reduction of allowances by 1.5% per year until 2030 lacking in serious ambition, as well failing to achieve EU’s climate ambition to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by 50-55% from 1990 levels by 2030. (see http://www.caneurope.org/publications/press-releases/1889-montenegro-s-cap-and-trade-system-could-signal-end-of-free-emissions-in-western-balkans-but-cap-needs-tightening). On the other hand, it is uncertain how affectively the cap and trade system will further be implemented, and will that be at a level which serves as a real incentive to decarbonize.  \nSince the Pljevlja plant has chosen the opt-out from the Large Combustion Plant Directive, now has less than 7000 working hours left, but it is still uncertain whether the envisaged ecological reconstruction of the thermal power plant will result in emission reductions, and whether the mentioned reconstruction will occur at all, therefore the need for introducing a border tax is even more urgent. \nIntroducing carbon border adjustment mechanism would: Encourage Montenegro to continue focusing on the process of decarbonisation and at the same time resolving a three decades long air pollution issues; Contribute to solving EUs problem of carbon leakage in the electricity sector; Remove unfair competition from non-compliant and highly polluting plants in non-EU countries that trade electricity with EU and neighboring countries; Fill in the authority gap inside the Energy Community Treaty and support the Energy Community Secretariat in discouraging Montenegro (and other Balkan countries) in planning any future investments in coal and prolonging life of the thermal power plant; Impose as another very strong reason for phasing out coal and accelerate just and sustainable transition in Montenegro (as well as the other Balkan countries). \nIn addition, Montenegro is working on becoming a member of the EU, and it will be very challenging to align with EU legislation in the future due to the EU’s increased efforts on fighting climate change, if Montenegro do not intensifies its efforts now and start planning decarbonisation of the energy sector and start developing steps right away to a complete end of coal dependence.\n\n",

Not surprisingly, it included an upcoming proposal for a \"carbon adjustment mechanism at the Union's borders\", an innovation designed to align the EU's trade policy with its decarbonisation objective. The issue of border adjustment, which for the last ten years has regularly reappeared on the European political agenda, is making a strong comeback in a context where the EU has decided to move towards carbon neutrality by 2050, and where many industrial sectors are increasingly concerned regarding the impact that this objective will have on their competitiveness. In its Communication of 11 December 2019, the Commission proposed a response to address these concerns by targeting the sectors that emit the most CO2 and are therefore most likely to be affected by ambitious measures to reduce these emissions.\nThe logic of this approach is mainly linked to the will to avoid the carbon leakage that is likely to occur when carbon price differentials lead to a relocation of the most emitting activities to regions with more permissive legislation. With lower carbon prices, carbon leakage could be considered limited. As soon as we move towards a significant increase in carbon prices on the European market, the risk of carbon leakage can no longer be underestimated.\n\nThe heightening of the carbon leakage phenomenon would pose a significant problem as it would counteract efforts to reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale. As a net CO2 importing region wherein carbon emissions from imported products account for approximately 30% of domestic CO2 production, a border adjustment would prove to be relevant for the European Union’s climate objectives, albeit potentially negative for some of its trading partners, those particularly affected being least developed countries and exporters of carbon-intensive products.\n\nThis paper reviews the technical and political difficulties behind the recent position of IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at the World Economic Forum in Davos on 23 January 2020, who publicly expressed concerns about the implementation of such a measure. With the\nsupport of the European Climate Foundation, this paper - the third in the series \"Greening EU trade policy\" - also takes stock of past attempts and reviews the legal and political criteria that need to be met for the adjustment mechanism to effectively meet its objectives. While recalling that an increase in the domestic price per tonne of carbon and the abolition of the free allocation system are necessary prerequisites for any corrective measures of a commercial nature, this note concludes that the European Commission should work towards a progressive mechanism parallel and equivalent to the EU ETS. This mechanism should initially target electricity and cement and then be extended to additional products subject to carbon pricing in the EU, subsequently paving the way for carbon pricing system convergences among trading partners\n\nEurope Jacques Delors's policy recommendations (Pascal Lamy, Geneviève Pons, Pierre Leturcq - Policy Paper - Publication 14 May 2020): \n1) A parallel system aligned with the EU ETS\n2) Targeted launch on pilot products: electricity and cement\n3) Nature and use of the levy: not a tax - EU own resource financing an independent agency responsible for assessing the carbon content of imported products and an energy transition fund for the least developed countries\n4) Fairness ensured by an independent agency\n5) Phasing out of free allowances simultaneously \n6) A \"test\" period for negotiations and necessary exemptions (linking existing ETSs and offering preferential treatment for certain developing countries)",

This system is flawed in several respects .  Nevertheless, the use of free allocation combined with the low prices for EUAs prevailing for much of the last decade has meant that there is no evidence of significant leakage to date. \n\nHowever, it is clear that free allocation is not sustainable into the long term and the cancellation mechanism built into the Market Stability Reserve of the EU ETS further strengthens this principle.  As the EUETS cap declines, eventually towards net-zero by 2050, there will be fewer and fewer allowances to allocate.  Our analysis shows that this is problem is likely to make full continuation free allocation unsustainable sometime in the early 2030s. However, giving industry an incentive to reduce emissions as well as a guarantee of a level playing field only in 2030 is too late. Action is needed now and it is clear that a Border Carbon Adjustment could be a good policy tool to transition EU industry outside of the free allocation regime already in the second phase of Phase 4 of the EU ETS.\n\nIf the carbon costs of EU industry cannot be lowered, the only alternative that adequately addresses the risk of carbon leakage is to raise the cost of emissions embodied in imports.  Direct financial subsidies to all EU producers to compensate for their carbon costs is not a realistic option for a variety of reasons. Zero carbon production, which would not incur a carbon price, would be another solution but it is not realistic in the short to medium term, especially for existing production.\n\nThis means that some form of BCA will in any case be required. \n\nSee attachement for recommendations on how this policy tool can best be designed.

This system is flawed in several respects’.\n1 https://sandbag.be/index.php/project/the-abc-of-bcas/ and www.sandbag.org.uk/thepathofleastresistance * Sandbag https://sandbag.be/index.php/project/carbon-leakage- See previous report conundrum/\nNevertheless, the use of free allocation combined with the low prices for EUAs prevailing for much of the last decade has meant that there is no evidence of significant leakage to date.\nHowever, it is clear that free allocation is not sustainable into the long term and the cancellation mechanism built into the Market Stability Reserve of the EU ETS further strengthens this principle. As the EUETS cap declines, eventually towards net-zero by 2050, there will be fewer and fewer allowances to allocate. Our analysis shows that this is problem is likely to make full continuation free allocation unsustainable sometime in the early 2030s. However, giving industry an incentive to reduce emissions as well as a guarantee of a level playing field only in 2030 is too late. Action is needed now and it is clear that a Border Carbon Adjustment could be a good policy tool to transition EU industry outside of the free allocation regime already in the second phase of Phase 4 of the EU ETS\nIf the carbon costs of EU industry cannot be lowered, the only alternative that adequately addresses the risk of carbon leakage is to raise the cost of emissions embodied in imports. Direct financial subsidies to all EU producers to compensate for their carbon costs is not a realistic option for a variety of reasons. Zero carbon production, which would not incur a carbon price, would be another solution but it is not realistic in the short to medium term, especially for existing production.\nThis means that some form of BCA will in any case be required.\nAlternative approaches: Product standards can and are welcome to complement BCAs, but cannot replace them — a portfolio of policies is needed\nBCAs and product standards are sometimes characterised as alternative policies, with a choice of one or the other policy required. However, in practice they are different tools having different effects. Consequently, product standards and BCAs can be introduced together, and indeed can complement each other as part of a wider policy package.\nBCAs provide a continuous (linear) incentive to reduce emissions, with higher costs the higher the emissions embodied in imports. The greater the reduction in emissions that is achieved, the greater the reductions in costs.\nIn contrast product standards have a yes/no character, although they do mandate a clear direction of transformation. Products are compliant or not. The yes/no nature of product standards means that they do not adequately address the complex problems of leakage, unless all current EU production has lower emissions than all production outside the EU (which will almost never be the case). For example, suppose EU production has emissions in the range 1.5 to 1.9 tonnes per tonne of product, and imports have embodied emissions in the range 1.5 to 2.1. Setting the standard tighter than 1.9 would mean some EU production being required to close, so not be achieve the objective of avoiding leakage. A product standard of no more than 1.9 tonnes per tonne of product would eliminate some high\nhttps://sandbag.be/index.php/project/results-barriers-to-decarbonisation-call-for- evidence/\ncarbon imports. However the remainder, with emissions at similar levels to EU production, would meet the standard and could be imported into the EU paying no carbon price, while EU producers continue to be subject to the EUETS.\nIn contrast BCAs solve this problem by imposing a price on imports for every tonne of embodied emissions, further incentivising third countries on their decarbonisation trajectory.\nWe urge the Commission to assess in its impact assessment the complementarity and synergy, which could result from implementing a combination of both as of 2025, while also keeping in mind that they are not interchangeable and that a combination of several policies will be required to deliver net-zero by 2050.\nRecommendation 1: BCAs should apply initially to emissions intensive trade exposed sectors plus power generation\nBCAs ought to be applied to sectors covered by the EUETS, specifically the power sector and industries covered by the carbon leakage list. The priority sectors should be those which are most emissions intensive and trade exposed, and so have a significant leakage risk, and those which have the largest emissions in absolute terms, so the environmental benefits of BCAs (from providing an enhanced carbon price signal) are greatest.\nSectors included are likely to include cement, steel, aluminium, parts of the chemicals sector and possibly pulp and paper. BCAs may be extended to cover other sectors over time, drawing on lessons learned and the administrative infrastructure established in the initial sectors.\nImports of electricity from outside the EU are only a small proportion of the total EU electricity market. However due to the emissions intensity of the power sector there is substantial scope for distortion of price signals for imports and the absolute volumes of emissions involved remaining material. For these reasons inclusion of the power sector in BCAs seems appropriate.\nRecommendation 2: To avoid windfall gains to emitters, BCAs and free allocation should not cover the same emissions\nFree allocation of allowances and shielding from BCAs should not both apply to the same part of emissions from EU producers. If they do, the producer in the EU will benefit twice, from the value of free allowance, and from the increase in costs for importers increasing market prices. This will create excess profits.\nSomething very similar to this has already been seen in the EUETS. There were surplus profits (“windfall gains”) totalling tens of billions of Euros in the power sector during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the EUETS, which our organisation has documented thoroughly.\nTo prevent this double profit, a BCA should be imposed only on the difference between any free allocation to EU producers and the amount of emissions embodied in imports. The\nquantity of embodied emissions subject to BCAs may then be increased as free allocation reduces.\nRecommendation 3: Implementation of BCAs should be phased in during Phase IV of the EU ETS.\nTime will be needed to establish the systems required to implement BCAs, and it seems unlikely to be possible to implement them before the mid-2020s. The most appropriate timing for the introduction of BCAs appears to be the next ETS mid-Phase review period, referred to in the Directive as 2023-2024, which would then mean the phased in regime could start end of 2025, covering the latter half of Phase IV and to coincide with the next revision of commitments under the Paris Agreement.\nPhasing in BCAs during Phase IV of the EUETS has a number of advantages. It will allow systems to be established and payments to be made while the size of the payments is relatively small, because some of free allocation remains in place. The effect on production and markets can then be assessed. This will enable informed, evidence-based decisions for Phase 5 in the 2030s.\nOne way of achieving this is illustrated schematically in the chart below. Initially there is free allocation at 100% of benchmark (2 tonnes per tonne of product in this illustrative case). Importers are subject to a small BCA (on 0.3 tonnes), because the benchmark used to set BCAs (2.3 tonnes) is above the free allocation benchmark. Over time the amount of free allocation decreases. As this happens the amount of embodied emissions in imports for which EUAs must be surrendered increases.\nThe benchmark for setting BCAs also falls over time as production becomes more efficient globally. However free allocation decreases more rapidly than the BCA benchmark, so the amount of emissions covered by the BCA increases. In the illustrative case shown the BCA benchmark falls to 1.9 tonnes per tonne of product, but free allocation falls to 1 tonne, so the BCA is payable on 0.9 tonnes. Eventually free allocation is removed completely, and the BCA is payable on the full benchmark amount.\nChart: schematic illustration of phase in of BCAs\n2.5\n2.0\nDe\neee CeCe eeeN Ue\nBenchmark for setting BCAs\nis also reduced\n1.5\nFree allocation\nin EU is\n2.1.0\nreduced\n0.5\n0.0\nStarting point\nPartial phase in\nFull application\nEU free allocation BCA\nRecommendation 4: EU producers will benefit in industries where importers have\nemissions above the EU free allocation benchmark\nThere are potential advantages to industry if BCA benchmarks are above current EU benchmarks. This arises if the international benchmark used to set BCA is above the EUETS benchmark (see first column on above chart). In this case free allocation can continue at a level sat by the benchmark, while there is a BCA imposed on the difference between the EU benchmark and the BCA benchmark. The additional emissions embodied in imports will be priced, so creating an advantage for the lower emissions EU production.\nRecommendation 5: Work on establishing rules and data for implementation should begin immediately\nThere are various aspects of design that require careful design of rules and protocol to avoid discrimination between competing suppliers and retain the advantages of BCAs in providing appropriate price signals. These include adjusting for any carbon price already paid, tracking jurisdiction of origin, setting benchmarks, and MRV for importers wishing to use their own emissions rather than a benchmark value. The issues raised are complex and data intensive.\nTo avoid undue delay to implementation of BCAs we recommend that work to establish these protocols begins immediately, and that is makes use of existing work, including existing databases, where possible.\nRecommendation 6: To minimise International opposition BCA’s they need to be designed to fit clear and well-defined criteria\nIn particular BCAs should be designed under the environmental exemption clauses of the GATT agreement and under the environmental provisions of the WTO protocols, as this policy is fundamentally a climate policy and contributes to international security, since\nclimate threat is one of the biggest threat to it. They should also be made in such a way to be non-discriminatory and meet clear environmental goals. This is likely to help minimise political opposition and ensure compatibility with WTO rules.\nRecommendation 7: Design of measures to counteract resource shuffling can draw on experience in California\nThere is a substantial risk of importers to the EU rerouting of products to minimise liability for BCAs without any reduction in emissions. This is known as “resource shuffling”. Rules will be needed to minimise this risk.\nIn establishing BCAs for electricity imports, California has included detailed rules to address the problem of resource shuffling for electricity imports. We recommend that the EU Study these rules and how they have been applied during the last few years to learn lessons about what might prove effective in Europe. This should include holding discussions with the California Air Resources Board.\nRecommendation 8: Value added thresholds should be used to avoid bypass of BCAs\nAnother problem is the potential bypass of BCAs is by importing semi-finished goods which lie outside the scope of the BCA rather than the commodity covered by the BCA. The claim to be outside the BCA may be made even of the further processing of the commodity is minor (“few holes drilled into some sheets of steel”).\nOne potential way round this is to define the bulk commodity as including all goods with value added up to a certain threshold. An EU producer may be vulnerable to competition from imports which have been categorised as semi-finished goods even though their value added to the bulk quality is small. We recommend examining application of a value added threshold (e.g. perhaps 20%), such goods are exempt from the BCA only if they have a value added greater than the threshold. Suitable measures would need to be imposed to prevent the transfer pricing within companies to circumvent such rules.\nRecommendation 9: BCAs should be part of a package that also includes other measures\nBCAs will not be enough on their own to put European industry on a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050. A wider policy package is needed. This includes policies to support innovation, continuing reforms to the EUETS, and measures to ensure that reducing emissions are a central part of the circular economy package. Sandbag’s forthcoming report on industrial decarbonisation will provide further details of what is required.\nRecommendation 10: Revenue from BCAs could be used to reinvest in climate measures and fund innovation\nBCAs will generate significant additional revenue. This could be used to help fund innovation in EU industry, lowering the cost of low carbon processes, and helping establish a prosperous zero carbon European economy. This leadership could in turn be leveraged,\nleading to faster emissions reductions elsewhere and part of the revenues could be used to support innovation abroad."

Only with a significant and rising carbon price, a BCA could really encourage investments in low-carbon technologies both in the EU and internationally  and potentially act on prices for commodities. In the current COVID-19 context, the carbon price is sinking and has reached its lowest levels since July 2018 (16 euros per tonne), and will barely recover in 2020. Stabilising the ETS price, at an effective level, seems to be a priority prior to implement any BCA. The fall of the EU ETS price will have an impact on public income from auctioning revenues and therefore on the funding of the Innovation fund. Measures to ensure that rapid carbon price falls are avoided need to be introduced for the phase four of the ETS (2021-2030). \n\n4) Despite the implementation of a carbon leakage list  by the European Commission (EC) for sectors qualified at risk, the evidence for the occurrence of carbon leakage as defined by the EU ETS Directive and due to its implementation has been extensively argued.

We support this proposal; \n• Be designed in a way that it would cover only energy-intensive sectors under EU ETS, mainly steel, cement, and basic chemicals; \n• Be part of a wider set of policies to enable and promote the investment in low carbon industrial processes, energy efficiency measures and renewable energies to achieve the decarbonisation of industry. The introduction of BCA is not the solution to tackle the lack of investment in low-carbon technologies. In order to build a successful low carbon industry within the EU, it is key to develop a clear policy framework containing the following measures: \n-a strong public innovation policy targeted towards market introduction of low carbon technologies, which will ensure investments in low carbon technologies through a robust innovation fund and exclude support for fossil lock-in technologies\n-contracts for difference or alternative measures such as subsidies to mitigate investment risks and support heavy industries dealing with the higher operational costs of low carbon technologies\n-obligation to purchase low carbon materials through public procurement and introduction of norms, quotas and standards for low carbon materials to create a lead market for low carbon technologies",

        "feedback": "Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)  applauds the European Commission's efforts towards climate neutrality.\n\nEDF encourages Europe to leverage its single market to encourage more ambitious global climate ambition and a more pro-climate interpretation of WTO rules. Because of the strength of the EU single market as an export market, border carbon adjustments (BCAs) would encourage GHG emission pricing in EU trading partners and give the EU an additional lever for increasing other countries’ ambition on climate.\n\nBased on the economics literature (Cosbey et al, 2019) and experience, EDF recommends a narrow sectoral coverage of the BCA mechanism focused on energy intensive trade exposed sectors, and including natural gas.\n\nThe BCA mechanism is an alternative to the EU’s current free allocation of allowances to address carbon leakage in the ETS. EDF recommends forthcoming impact analysis to include: \n\n- assessment of the different options for addressing carbon leakage such as free allowances, BCAs or a combination of both (e.g., using free allowances for products destined for exports);\n\n- the distributional impact and environmental benefits of the increased public revenues from the removal of free allocation combined with increased prices on both domestic and foreign produced goods in the affected sectors. \n\nBCAs can have a distributional effect across countries. To focus on the environmental motivation for a BCA mechanism, and to ensure it is not seen as punitive toward developing economies, EDF recommends the impact analysis review potential effects of earmarking BCA revenues to climate and energy related purposes, with most of the funds used to support developing countries affected by the BCAs.  One potential mechanism for such transfers would be to use the revenues to pay for high quality Internationally Traded Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.  Financing ITMOs will ensure the BCA revenues are used towards additional verifiable emission reductions.  \n\nEDF recommends BCAs based on existing sectoral carbon footprint benchmarks. \n\nThe BCA mechanism may allow for credits on imports for GHG prices paid in the origin country. Correspondingly, the BCA mechanism could also allow for a credit on exported goods destined to export markets without equivalent climate policies (equivalent to current free allowances under EU ETS but now only for exported goods). \n\nEDF also wants to emphasise the importance of  leveraging the Union’s market position as the world’s largest gas importer to addressing methane emissions from the EU’s natural gas supply chain, including from imports. Best available data suggests that the largest share of the EU’s methane footprint from natural gas are upstream emissions in the supply chain for natural gas imported to the EU. To reduce this footprint, the EU should adopt a mandatory performance standard for all gas sold in the EU market, including from imports, of maximum 0.20% upstream methane intensity by 2025. \n\nFor natural gas, EDF recommends the EU consider applying a methane emission price on both imported and domestically produced gas with the following no-regret features in the early phase:\n\n- use the IPCC Tier 1 emission factors for natural gas systems (using the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines) to establish default methane emission intensity estimates per unit of natural gas;\n\n- allow producers a proportional reduction on the level of the methane payment on their gas if they provide certified, credible, third-party verified data on emission intensity representative of all their production facilities, with the underlying calculations made public;\n\n- grant credits towards EU methane emissions payments for any emissions price already paid in the production country on the condition that such payments can be verified in fiscal registries and are based on third-party verified and appropriately sampled measurements of methane emissions per above.\n\n\n\n",

For example, Narenrada Modi, Indian Prime Minister, stated “there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others” at the opening of COP21 where agreement was reached on a new global climate architecture. The US Commerce Secretary Wilbour Ross warned “Depending on what form the carbon tax takes, we will react to it” whilst He Jiankun from Tsinghua University, a delegate for the Chinese government, stated \"Currently adopting this type of cross-border measure could influence the friendly atmosphere of cooperation in the process of confronting climate change.\"The EU impact assessment must outline border measures advance trust, cooperation and international efforts to accelerate climate action. \n\nb) A credible threat? The EU introduced a carbon border measure for all international air travel arriving and departing from the EU in 2009. Significant global political pressure from the US, China and India crushed this measure. President Obama approved the Thune Bill which prohibited US airlines from complying with the EU ETS Aviation legislation. China and India also did the same with their airlines. China then threatened to delay and possibly cancel its order for 55 Airbus planes, which ultimately forced the French government to seek a delay to in the enforcement of EU legislation.  There is no indication that the EU is in a stronger position to fend off these countries as well as Brazil, Russia and others, and this time on three sectors. Failure would render the whole exercise worthless, damage the EU’s credibility and isolate it at a time when it must drive global cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.  \n\nc) Asymmetrical retaliation: China delaying and threatening to cancel Airbus orders was an example of direct retaliation confined to the same sector. Most trade war retaliation is asymmetrical. For example, China stopped purchasing US agricultural products namely soybeans, the most valuable American crop export, in response to US tariffs on Chinese steel imports. This hammered the $9.1 billion yearly export market but the plight of farmers cost the US economy $28 billion for just two years of compensation. Furthermore, the steel tariffs are expected to cost US dairy famers $12.8 billion by 2023.The EU’s impact assessment will have to calculate the potential economic impact of retaliatory measures across the EU economy. \n\nd) Competition concerns: Cement and steel, two of the sectors expected to benefit from a CBAM have a long history of anti-trust and price fixing in the EU. This has done considerable harm to the functioning of the Internal Market, public policy and citizens considerable harm.

For example, Narenrada Modi, Indian Prime Minister, stated “there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others” at the opening of COP21 where agreement was reached on a new global climate architecture.! The US Commerce Secretary Wilbour Ross warned “Depending on what form the carbon tax takes, we will react to it”? whilst He Jiankun from Tsinghua University, a delegate for the Chinese government, stated \"Currently adopting this type of cross-border measure could influence the friendly atmosphere of cooperation in the process of confronting climate change.\"3\n1\nThe EU impact assessment must outline border measures advance trust, cooperation and international efforts to accelerate climate action.\nA credible threat? The EU introduced a carbon border measure for all international air travel arriving and departing from the EU in 2009.

Failure would render the whole exercise worthless, damage the EU’s credibility and isolate it at a time when it must drive global cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.\n3 Asymmetrical retaliation: China delaying and threatening to cancel Airbus orders was an example of direct retaliation confined to the same sector. Most trade war retaliation is asymmetrical. For example, China stopped purchasing US agricultural products namely soybeans, the most valuable American crop export, in response to US tariffs on Chinese steel imports. This hammered the $9.1 billion yearly export market but the plight of farmers cost the US economy $28 billion for just two years of compensation.4 Furthermore, the steel tariffs are expected to cost US dairy famers $12.8 billion by 2023.5\nThe EU’s impact assessment will have to calculate the potential economic impact of retaliatory measures across the EU economy.\nCompetition concerns: Cement and steel, two of the sectors expected to benefit from a CBAM have a long history of anti-trust and price fixing in the EU. This has done considerable harm to the functioning of the Internal Market, public policy and citizens considerable harm. If a few companies can control access to the EU or national markets it implies that they are not truly exposed to domestic or international competition undermining the case for border measures in the first place.\nImportantly, the EU ETS 2007 impact assessment concluded that it4 ...market concentration in the cement industry is rather high and prone to collusion and formation of cartels” whilst the 2019 ETS reform was concluded whist DG Competition was investigating a cartel structure in Holcim cement.\nExamples of cartels include:\ni) The ‘Cembureau Agreement’ comprised 42 European cement producers and associations from 14 different Member States who prevented shipment to markets to fix prices;®\nii) The ‘Hardcore cartel’ in Germany which operated from the 1990s to 2002;7 iii) The ‘Thyssenkrupp, Voestalpine, Vossloh and Moravia Steel’ cartel which fixed high prices for Deutsche Bahn, the German railway for over a decade; iv) The ‘Club Europe’ steel cartel which ran from 1984 to 2002 and was present in\n4 Reuters, “U.S. farmers suffer 'body blow' as China slams door on farm purchases”. 5 August, 2019.\n5 BBC, “What US farmers make of Trump's trade deal”. 17 January, 2020.\n6 Judgement of the Court of First Instances, Joined cases: S T-25/95, T-26/95, T-30/95 TO T-32/95, T-34/95 TO T-39/95, T-42/95 TO T-46/95, T-48/95, T-So/9S TO T-6S/95, T-68/95 TO T-71/95, T-87/95, T-88/95, T-103/95 AND T-104/95, 15 March 2000, p.519, 18.\n7 Cartel Damage Clams, Cement Cartels, 2014.\n8 DW, “ThyssenKrupp settles with Deutsche Bahn over rail cartel damages”. 20 November 2013.\nchangepartneship.org\nPage 2 of 3\nevery Member State.9\nThe EU’s impact assessment must re-examine the competitiveness of these sectors taking into account their oligopolist and even monopsony market structures before any recommendation is made for protectionism which could jeopardise the whole EU economy.\nSanjeev Kumar Founder, Change Partnership sanjeev@changepartnership.org +32 499 539731\n9\nSherman and Sterling ‘Cartel Digest’.

Given the expected potential\nhigher climate ambition for 2030, we recognize that additional and improved carbon leakage provisions may be needed. However, we believe that alternative measures than proposed CBAM-options (in the IIA) are needed and give our analysis of the strength and weaknesses of the proposed 4 options. Our proposal is, that EU should research and develop a different way to strengthen the existing carbon leakage measures bearing in mind the basic principles laid out at the end of our reaction.\nEU’s long-term objective is to reach climate neutrality by 2050. European Commission in its Green Deal states “should differencies in level of ambition worldwide persist, as the EU increases its Climate ambition, the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors to reduce the risk of carbon leakage”. The Paris Agreement on climate includes a mechanism, where countries can increase their nationally determined contributions of reducing their GHG emissions. The next stock-taking meeting takes place in 2023.\nThe sectors that should be covered by the border adjustment mechanism should be limited to those that are currently deemed having medium or high risk of carbon leakage under the ETS.\nThe adjustment must be designed so that it sets the carbon price for imported products at the same level as the corresponding products have in the EU due to EU regulations. Imported products should not be discriminated.\nImporters of the relevant products shall be obliged to certify the carbon emissions or product environmental footprint of the product, taking into account both the direct and indirect GHG-emissions of the production. The certification must be verified by an independent third party, e.g. accredited inspection company.\nThe adjustment mechanism can create a level playing field inside EU-market, but not at the export market. This is why it is necessary to maintain the existing rules for carbon leakage, free allowances and compensation of indirect costs, for European export companies. These measures must continue until up to 2030.\nIndirect costs compensation does not exists in all Member States or the level of compensation varies from country to country. This creates distortions in the EU single market that cannot be tolerated. In the connection of carbon border adjustment mechanism there should be a separate fund that collects the adjustment fees.\nIn the following we give our analysis of the several options of the future form of CBAM proposed in the IIA: 1 Carbon customs duty on imports 2. Carbon tax on selected products — both imported and domestic products 3. Carbon border tax on imports only 4. Extension of the EU ETS to imports.\nFinnish Steel and Metal Producers\nEtelaranta 10, P.O. Box 10, FI-00131 Helsinki\nTelephone +358 9 192 31\nwww.techind. fi\nBusiness ID: 1516919-1\n2 (4)\n1 Carbon customs duty on imports\nThis measure could be described a financial equivalent of the industry costs due to the ETS scheme and indirect costs. In this option the Commission will use the EU Common Commercial Policy (art. 192 TFEU) as a legal basis for CBAM implementation.\nStrenght:\nWeaknesses:\nWeaknesses:\ne It is relatively transparent, as there will be a stable price listed to non-EU countries e Another advantage of this measure is that it would be voted as on the qualified majority by Member States. Nevertheless, it is more difficult defend under the WTO law, as the only argumentation is exceptions of art XX GATT.\ne It is difficult to set the right level of tariff In particular, it will create a real difficulty to define the real equivalent of the industry costs, especially in case of indirect costs. In case it has be defined for each imported product, the importer will have to provide some evidence (audit etc) that it will be very difficult/ nearly impossible to control. In case of an average costs benchmark based on EU industry costs it can be difficult to implement politically, and might look like a protective measure, unless the importer will have the possibility to provide evidence to get a discount, in case his costs are lower than the estimated benchmark. In practice, it may lead to difficulties related to enforcements and controls. It is not clear how it will work for the concluded EU Free Trade Agreements They will need to be changed on ad-hoc basis, so EU will have to re-negotiate with the concluded deals with a significant number of countries It is not obvious how non-EU producers will be incentivised to produce greener products. If the tariff is set on the average costs level, it will be no incentive for the companies to improve. In case of individual rebates, it will be very difficult to control.\n2. Carbon tax on selected products, both imported and domestic products\nStrenghts:\ne This option might be easier to implement e This instrument can be implemented as an Environmental Policy measure, which means it can be easier defended under the WTO law in comparison to Commercial Policy measures. Nevertheless, as this is instrument is of fiscal nature, which means that all Member States should unanimously vote for this. Some Member States might not support this option politically It covers both domestic products and imports, which fulfils the WTO requirement for non-discrimination of imports. (art. Ill of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) This option will be more accepted by third countries, as it is an environmental non-discriminatory measure, so the risk of trade tensions with third countries is diminished.\ne It is an additional tax on EU producers e If introduced only on several products, it will create imbalances in terms of value-chain.\n3 (4)\n3. Carbon tax on imports only\nStrengths:\nWeaknesses:\nIn relation to the metals industry it will be very difficult define the identical product due to the variety of products and specifications. For example, would a metal produced with means of coal is identical with a metal produced with means of electricity? In any case robust methodology is needed. It is not very clear, how the legislator envisages a measure applicable on domestic products as well, considering the current ETS scheme and indirect costs. Most probably, it is meant as additional measure after and/or instead of existing ETS scheme.\ne The carbon tax might be easier to implement, as it requires a price that importer needs to pay. e This instrument will be implemented as an Environmental Policy measure, which means it can be easier defended under the WTO law in comparison to Commercial Policy measures. Nevertheless, as this is instrument is of fiscal nature, which means that all Member States should unanimously vote for this. Some Member States might not support this option politically.\ne It will be considered discriminatory by third countries, which will increase the risk of trade tensions and possible WTO disputes. In order to calculate it, there is a need to know internal and external carbon prices and footprints. In addition, this information should be regularly updated. Thus, in practical terms, it is very difficult to implement it in a practical way.\n4. Extension of the EU ETS to imports\nIn this case importers would have to buy ETS allowances. If from the same ETS pool as EU producers, it might have an impact on EU market. If EU will create a separate pool for third countries companies, it might be considered as a discriminatory measure, so will again lead to trade tensions and WTO disputes.\nConclusions:\nAs a conclusion the Steel and Metal Producers of Finland wants to emphaisize that all of the proposed options by the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism have some advantages, but also some significant disadvantages. Therefore, there is no ideal option, so far, that would suit the purpose.\nAs a contribution by the Finnish Steel and Metal Producers we would like to offer our view on the basic mandatory principles to be incorporated to the possible system:\n1 It is necessary that the system provides strong international incentives to decarbonise manufacturing conditions in third countries, but in the first place this requires an EU CBA which provides a level playing field with third country producers which are not subject to the same environmental constraints. Any CBA regime must be based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products, i.e. not a simple average benchmark or ad valorem, for example. In other words, a product with a high carbon footprint must be taxed materially higher than a similar product with a materially lower carbon footprint.\n4 (4)\nTo ensure proper incentives for third countries, any EU carbon pricing system, including a CBA mechanism, should not apply to products exported from the EU. A carbon border adjustment mechanism must not replace, and a priori any transitional period of partial CBA application must not endanger: e An effective EU trade policy, including existing ordinary import duties and trade defense measures (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguards); Existing EU carbon leakage measures, i.e. ETS free allowances, until a CBA mechanism is fully in place and seen to be effective; Currently applied EU indirect cost compensation, to the extent the CBA mechanism does not effectively cover the entire supply chain, including energy inputs; EU regulatory relief foreseen in the State Aid Guidelines on Energy and Environment (EEAG). While the avoidance of additional administrative burdens is important, an effective CBA mechanism requires a legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products. The effectiveness of the mechanism will depend on the details of its design and its ability to adapt in the face of absorption and source shifting. Throughout the process of putting in place a comprehensive CBA mechanism, transparency and close dialogue with trading partners will be important. To be coherent with the objective of the CBA, and the EU climate policy objectives in general, funds raised from the CBA should be used primarily to encourage investments in carbon-reducing technologies. Some of the funds raised could be used to provide assistance for (low-income) consumers to ease consumer burdens and increase societal support for the arrangements.\nContact: Kimmo Jarvinen, managing Director, Kimmo.jarvinen@techind.fi, phone +358 43 825 7642\nABOUT FINNISH STEEL AND METAL PRODUCERS\nFinnish Steel and Metal Producers is the voice of the Finnish Steel and Metal producers and major metal recyclers in Europe.

        "feedback": "Center for Environment from Bosnia & Herzegovina is in favour of a stringent carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) for all ETS sectors, including electricity production and trade.\nBosnia & Herzegovina is currently strongly dependent on coal with 70% of electricity coming from thermal power plants, and is planning to add new capacities, with a plan to export coal generated power, including to EU markets. Coal electricity producers in B&H are severely subsidised by the state (as was shown in the Energy Community Secretariat analysis from 2019), resulting in market distortions, consumption patterns and long-term viability of systems relying on coal-fired power production. \nNext to the economic downsides as well as corruption issues plaguing coal TPPs in BiH, their environmental track record has been disastrous, with clear violations of the EIA procedures - LCPD, enshrined in both domestic laws as well as the Energy Community Treaty legislation. Power plants in Bosnia & Herzegovina are far from compliant with this legislation, as a 2019 report shows that thermal power plants in B&H were polluting nine times more than their allowed ceiling, violating obligations spanning from the Large Combustion Plants Directive which went into force on January 1st same year. (see Bankwatch’s report Comply or close, Decembe 2019).\nBosnia and Herzegovina plans to build more new coal power plants, some of which are in clear contradiction with environmental and State aid rules of EU and EnCom. Most of the previously produced feasibility studies do not contain an assumption (or underestimate the price) of aa carbon tax or CBAM (in case of exports). Such false economic justification will produce plants heading a future where they face either a shut down or further operation with loss, addicted to state subsidies. Both scenarios are at a detriment to B&H’s economy and will leave its citizens indebted. A CBAM would be an additional stimulus for an introduction of a domestic CO2 pricing mechanism, leading to an energy transition in B&H, in line with future membership in post-Green New Deal EU.\nAll of the above argumentation has in so far not managed to change the stakeholders’ minds on coal development, due to the plans for future export. However, carbon taxing policies, be it domestic ETS or CBAM has a clear potential to be the straw which breaks the camel's back and a final impetus for a clean energy transition in B&H. Given that EU accession for B&H is not expected within the next few years at least, this is too long to wait for the introduction of carbon pricing. Action has to be taken now. The Energy Community Treaty Contracting Parties need to introduce a carbon price. In the electricity sector, a CBAM tax would encourage ETS countries to continue their phase-out of coal and prevent carbon leakage from non-ETS countries. However, as the Balkan governments have an ask in this matter, chances are it will be strongly countered and if accepted, it will take a long time. An EU CBAM would be the first palpable carbon pricing scheme the Balkan governments would face, and certainly a strong wake up call.\nIn addition, due to the EU’s increased efforts on climate, for a country like B&H that is  planning to join the EU, it would be rather difficult to align with EU legislation in the future if the work on this  matter doesn’t start right away by developing step by step, as well as by avoiding a financial coal lock-in.\nFinally, the introduction of carbon pricing in B&H would:\n-Encourage B&H to become more ambitious in the process of decarbonisation\n-Contribute to solving EUs problem of carbon leakage in the electricity sector\n-Remove unfair competition from non-compliant and highly polluting plants in non-EU countries that trade electricity with EU and neighboring countries\n-Fill in the authority gap inside the Energy Community Treaty and support the Energy Community Secretariat in discouraging B&H (and other Balkan countries) plans for new coal projects.\n",

Both direct and indirect CO, emissions (including Scope 3) also need to be included to prevent further carbon leakage, even when the indirect segment is not yet subject to EU ETS.\nAccording to the UN's 2019 Global Resources Outlook, resource extraction and processing account for half of the world's carbon emissions.’ In addition, according to the OECD, raw materials use is expected to double by 2060.’ Failing to include the entire value chain would lead to a potential increase in imports of carbon-intensive non-taxed products like coke, pig iron, directly reduced iron (DRI) or other products, and could increase rather than reduce carbon leakage to the Union. Choosing to cover one part of the value chain but not others would also disrupt the level playing field within the EU industry: segments of the industry would be advantaged over the other which is not acceptable from a policy perspective (technology/product neutrality).\nOn the second point, adherent to the ‘polluter pays' principle, it is critical that 'cleaner' third-country producers importing steel into the EU should be taxed less, and / or third-country producers with a CO, footprint lower than the EU benchmark (however it is calculated) should be exempted. Otherwise, its duty should be adjusted. For example, a third-country integrated steel producer performing better than an average EU integrated producer should be taxed less or exempted when they import into the EU.\nThe ‘polluter pays' principle could also be used to adjust the mechanism to incentivise producers whose CO, footprint is better than that of the average EU producer, setting a clear stimulus for decarbonisation. This setup would not only contribute to negative carbon leakage (reducing emissions elsewhere), but also ensure that the EU preserves its capacity to achieve its internal climate targets, by stimulating a material import flow of cleaner materials from third regions.\nWithout an individual adjustment, a 'one-size-fits-all' mechanism applied to third-country producers exporting to the EU, would be discriminatory towards ‘cleaner’ third-country producers who have already invested in lowering emissions, and would not lead to better global CO. mitigating outcomes. On the contrary, a flat tax for example without an individual adjustment would benefit importers with the lowest costs, including lower investments in CO2 reductions. Moreover, such a mechanism could result in substitution of more expensive ‘cleaner’ steel (their price already including abatement costs) with cheaper products manufactured by companies with less ambitious decarbonisation efforts. To keep their market share and remain price-competitive, cleaner producers would be forced to reduce their R&D and/or stop investing in decarbonisation efforts, slowing down global COz mitigation progress.\nThe measure outlined in the above requires establishing a universal standardised CO, certification methodology and an independent universal verification system to allow for an individual company to prove they are eligible for the tax reduction or exemption. We believe it should be modelled after the EU ETS and therefore be producer-based. The burden of proof would be on the producer, and\n* Euractiv (2019), ‘Resource extraction responsible for half world’s carbon emissions’,\nhttps www.euractiv.com/section/circular-economy/news/resource-extraction-responsible-for-half-worlds-carbon- emissions/\n*\nOECD (2018), 'Raw materials use to double by 2060 with severe environmental consequences’, https www.oecd.org/environment/raw-materials-use-to-double-by-2060-with-severe-environmental- consequences.htm\nideally it should be an automatic ex-ante system to prevent the need for a complex administration, avoiding barriers to trade.\nTo sum up, any border measure to be designed smartly needs to be inclusive in terms of product scope (start from the very upstream and cover as much downstream as possible) and be flexible in terms of accounting for the actual carbon intensity of the imported products to avoid carbon leakage.\nAbout NLMK Europe\nNLMK Europe is a steel producer consisting of the business units NLMK Europe Plate (comprising NLMK Clabecq in Belgium, NLMK DanSteel in Denmark and NLMK Verona in Italy) and NLMK Europe Strip (comprising NLMK La Louviére in Belgium, NLMK Strasbourg in France and NLMK Manage Steel Center in Belgium). With an overall annual production capacity in 2018 of 3.4 million tonnes of value-added steel products, NLMK Europe employs roughly 2,200 people. Key end users include the automotive, shipbuilding, construction and energy-producing companies, as well as offshore windmill manufacturers.\nNLMK Europe focuses on_ innovations, long-term customer relations and sales network development, which enhances on-time deliveries to customers in Europe and across the globe. It belongs to NLMK Group, which is a leading international manufacturer of high-quality steel products with a vertically integrated business model. NLMK Group is headquartered in Russia, and its shares are traded at the Moscow and London stock exchanges.\nIn August 2019, NLMK joined the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest sustainable development and corporate social responsibility initiative. As a participant to the UN Global Compact, the NLMK Group voluntarily commits to align its operations and strategy with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to take action in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Group will report on its progress in the sustainable development area on an annual basis.\nNLMK has continuously strived and invested to be a leader in sustainable development. In October 2019, we announced a 150-million-euro project for NLMK La Louviére (Belgium) to revamp its mill and produce more environmentally friendly steel. Since 1990, we have reduced our CO, emissions by 13% per ton of steel, with an increase in output growth by 35% at the same time."

To decarbonise energy-intensive industries, the EU requires a policy package of measures. These measures will need to: a) support the first commercial-scale sites using climate-neutral technology, b) create an enabling state aid framework, c) facilitate investment in key infrastructure and feedstocks (such as Hydrogen and CCS), and d) include a robust framework for protection against carbon leakage that may in the medium-term and under certain conditions include a BCA. Since CO2 prices in the EU ETS are too low and too uncertain to drive industry investments into climate neutral production, and since coordinated infrastructure planning is required, the EU ETS alone will not be sufficient to decarbonise heavy industry. Even a combination of BCAs and ETS reform will do little to alter this fundamental situation. BCAs must therefore not be allowed to distract from these other, urgent policy objectives. In the present economic and geopolitical context, we believe that the risk of BCAs becoming a divisive and distracting issue to the rest of the industrial decarbonisation package is high. While we argue that a new carbon leakage protection system is necessary from the mid-2030s, currently several key conditions for BCAs to be implemented with a good chance of success are not in place. The EU would be acting unilaterally against the will of major trading partners. Many EU industrial facilities are not among the world’s best performers when it comes to CO2 intensity. Downstream sectors such as the auto sector are economically weakened and they would have to pay higher CO2 costs. Some sectors may object if competing sectors within the EU are left out of the scope of the BCA, while they are included. Moreover, in the wake of the economic fall-out from the coronavirus, there is a heightened risk of border adjustment debates becoming hijacked for nationalist economic or political objectives. Unless developed as part of a coalition with major trading partners, BCAs would likely encounter significant domestic and international political opposition, creating risks about the EU’s capacity to follow through with this policy. In the short term, taking this risk is unnecessary: the current system of benchmark based free allocation (plus indirect cost compensation) can, if combined with complementary decarbonisation support policies for industry, be reformed to offer effective carbon-leakage protection until the mid-2030s, if not longer. However, in the medium-term — i.e. sometime between 2035 and 2040 - the system of free allocation will become unsustainable, as free allocation would consume 100% or more of total EU ETS cap. Even once fully decarbonised, climate neutral EU industries will still face higher production costs than conventional technologies. By this time, the EU will therefore need to shift to a longer term solution than free allocation. Three long-term alternatives to free allocation exist to provide anti-leakage protection. The Commission should explore all three of these options to fully appreciate their respective costs\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nand benefits. These three main options are: a) carbon product standards, applied to all domestically-produced or imported goods sold in the EU’s internal market b) Border carbon adjustments c) free allocation plus carbon-charge based approaches. Each of these options has its pros and cons. However, one of them will need to be chosen. What matters is a robust anti- leakage framework — thus all alternatives should be considered. In our view, the best of the above three options for the EU would be to aim to implement climate-neutral product standards for all energy intensive basic materials sold in the EU’s market by around 2035. This would be simplest from a WTO-legal, administrative simplicity, and political-economy perspective. Developing standards would provide the clearest and least uncertain signal for industry, thus doing most to facilitate the EU’s domestic transition. Climate neutral product standards could be set based on existing technological knowledge and enter into force between 2035-40, thus providing clarity for industrial investment today and replacing free allocation from that date. The process of developing the policy infrastructure for standards is also likely to be a no regret action: For the sake of implementing its own domestic transition, the EU will probably need to set standards for domestic consumption of energy intensive goods in addition to carbon pricing. This follows from the reality that the CO2 carbon price is currently too low and too volatile to drive investment by itself. The EU standards linked to trade measures also have several precedents, such as EU measures implementing the Montreal protocol for ozone depleting substances, EU measures against imports of “blood diamonds”, or EU Measures against imports of illegally harvested timber or fish from illegal or unregulated fishing activities. Given the importance of its internal market, the EU has been quite successful in the past to engage its international trading partners in cooperation on the development and effective implementation of such standards. Under all long-term solutions, the EU will need to prepare the diplomatic and technical groundwork, for long-term anti-leakage solutions to be implemented. Things like defining long term product CO2 standards, certification and labelling systems and diplomatic or technical coordination with international trading partners are no regret measures that the EU could undertake during the next 5 years. Whichever the approach(es) taken, to the extent that the EU can build coalitions adopting common approaches, it will increase its capacity to avoid and resist eventual retaliation.\nAgora\nEnergiewende\n1. Context\nAgora considers that any thorough assessment of Border Carbon Adjustments to address carbon leakage must begin with a clear understanding of the present context:\nFirst and foremost, an overarching objective of this Commission must be to put energy-intensive industry on a pathway to climate neutrality by 2050, as noted by the Green Deal Communication. In this context, measures to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage will need to be a part of the policy package that can create a robust framework for investment. While necessary, anti-leakage measures on their own do not make a business case for investment in climate neutral technologies and infrastructure. Therefore, the EU discussion on anti-leakage measures must not be allowed to distract from or undermine this broader and extremely urgent objective.\nSecondly, a relatively well-functioning anti-leakage system (free allocation) already exists and can be continued with small changes until at least 2030, if not longer. Therefore, the EU does not need to rush to a new solution to carbon leakage for which the international acceptance and support may not be in place. The economic fall-out of the coronavirus response, while still uncertain, may also make the international politics of industry protection yet more complicated. The EU should at the very least, use the time available to try to build international acceptance and support of its approach.\nThirdly, beyond the approximately mid-2030s, the current anti-leakage system will become unsustainable (see Figure 1). Genuinely protective levels of free allocation would begin to consume an increasingly large share of, and eventually exceed, the ETS cap. The EU must therefore prepare today to shift to an alternative, and more sustainable, anti-leakage system beyond 2030. This solution must be one that can ensure robust protection of energy intensive industries as they moves to decarbonised, but more expensive, production technology, ahead of other nations.\nFigure 1. Estimated evolution of EU ETS cap under higher ambition scenarios (bars) and expected free allocation requirements at the full benchmark under two different primary production scenarios (lines)*\nMmmm ETS cap = -53% in 2030 & -95%\nin 2050 (new ambition 1)\nmmm ETS cap = -58% in 2030 & -\n105% in 2050 (new ambition 2)\n—— Ell free allocation requirement\n(current primary production)\n—— Ell free allocation requirement\n(falling primary production)\ni\n2021 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n1000\n500\n*The primary production of certain energy intensive products may fall due to a range of factors, including the growth of more circular production of goods, declining oil refining for transportation, and shutdowns of excess capacity.\nmm\n1500\nAgora\nEnergiewende\n2. What matters is effective anti-leakage protection. Several options should be considered, not only border carbon adjustments.\nBorder carbon adjustments are not an end in themselves. While the EU will need to prepare a transition to more sustainable anti-leakage measures post-2030, BCAs are just one possible solution. Our analysis suggests that longer term solutions for anti-leakage measures could take several forms. While BCAs may be desirable from some perspectives, they also carry a high level of political and legal risk. The EU should therefore broaden its analysis of BCAs to consider the full range of anti- leakage options that could replace or complement free allocation over the longer term.\nWe see four main alternatives that the EU should consider:\n1 Modified free allocation and (state) aid to invest 2 Border Carbon Adjustments 3 ETS-linked consumption-charges for Ell products 4 Carbon Product Standards\nEach of these options has advantages and disadvantages that need to be weighed. Under certain circumstances, some of these solutions may be combined. In particular, Option 1, which consists of extending the current free allocation system beyond 2030, would only be a temporary measure. Ultimately, the EU will need to settle on one of or a mix of the last three options as a long-term solution.\nAgora believes that a step-wise approach beginning with Option 1 - i.e. periodically continuing free allocation together with reforms to the scope and free allocation system under the ETS — and then ultimately moving to Option 4. (Carbon product standards) is preferable. Given the complexities, a combination of measures, beyond just BCAs, may be needed. We would therefore encourage the Commission to expand the scope of its assessment to include not only BCAs, as historically conceived, but also other options to address carbon leakage.\nAgora\nEnergiewende\n3. Four basic options are available to the EU. All of them involve pros and cons. However, we must choose one of them.\nOption 1. (temporary) Modified free allocation and (state) aid to invest\nA temporary solution to the carbon leakage problem is to find ways to extend the current system of free allocation over a longer period, thus delaying the need to shift to alternative anti-leakage measures, such as BCAs. This option may make sense if the EU believes that the conditions will not be aligned to move to alternative solutions for a significant number of energy intensive sectors before ca. 2030-2035’.\nAssuming the EU raises its 2030 and 2050 climate ambition, free allocation would quickly begin to consume a large share, and eventually exceed, the total annual allocation under the ETS cap. This is likely to become politically unsustainable with regard to other sectors, even before the ETS cap is exceeded. Thus, some way to reconcile the declining ETS cap and the need to still provide sufficient protection to industries would be needed. Two stylised options might be considered relying on some form of temporarily continued free allocation:\nOption 1a. Expanded ETS and cross-sectoral transfers of initial allocation\nOne option to address this problem might be to add additional sectors to the EU ETS. For example, adding energy use in the buildings and transport sectors to the ETS would add emissions in the order of 569 and 897 million allowances respectively to the ETS. Similarly, sales of fuels to non-energy intensive industries (currently outside the scope of the ETS) could potentially add around 200 million allowances to the ETS. Adding domestic shipping or removing free allocation to domestic aviation in the ETS could potentially add a further 21 and 32 million allowances. These options would increase the overall allocation pool in the ETS by anywhere between 2% and 70%. By contrast, Ell sectors represent roughly 45% of the ETS allocation pool today. Thus, even with modest intersectoral transfers of allowances, it could allow for energy intensive industry to be freely allocated allowances for a significantly longer period without the full ETS cap being consumed.\nThe logic of the expanded ETS approach is conditional on the assumption that adding additional sectors to the ETS makes policy sense on its own merits. The answer to this question is beyond the scope of this consultation. One potential drawback of this approach is that it would mean that sectors ceding a share of their free allowances to industry may fear that it will cause their ETS costs to rise. However, this would nonetheless be compatible with the polluter pays principle and consistent with past approaches under the ETS. This approach may therefore be either combined or substituted with Option 1b, now described.\nOption 1b. Free allocation gradually replaced by aid to invest in low carbon\nAn alternative approach would be to gradually reduce the total free allocation it provides to ETS installations by essentially substituting it with state aid. However, if state aid is to be given, then it is\n’\nThis is not a purely theoretical scenario. BCAs face substantial political, legal and administrative hurdles to being effectively implemented in the next decade, especially if the EU is not able to implement them collaboratively with key trading partners, such as the US and China. Similarly, carbon product standards, will require the EU to first build up decarbonised industrial production capacity before they can be implemented.\n5\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nlikely that governments would require some valuable outcome for the climate on the basis of this aid. How would this be done?\nOne option might be to divide the installations into two groups. Group 1 would continue to receive free allocation, but perhaps at a declining share of the full conventional technology benchmark. Meanwhile, Group 2 would not receive free allocation, but would instead receive EU and/or state aid to invest into deep decarbonisation solutions. Installations in Group 2 could receive the aid on a project-by-project basis. Industrial deep decarbonisation projects would apply to receive an annual payment, equivalent to the breakeven carbon price for their project, multiplied by their emissions reductions per unit of production. Figure 2 shows how this might help to reduce the need for free allocation, assuming such contracts were provided only to the steel, cement and petrochemicals sectors.\nFigure 2. How free allocation requirements (lines) may fall due in comparison to the ETS cap (bars) if aid is provided to steel, cement and chemicals sectors to invest in climate neutral production.\n1800\nMam ETS cap = -53% in 2030 & -95% in\n—\n1600\n2050 (new ambition 1)\n1400\n1200\nMam ETS cap = -58% in 2030 & -105% in\n1000\n2050 (new ambition 2)\n800\n600\n=Total EITE allocation requirement\n400\nwith enhanced abatement\nfor\n200\nsteel, cement, chemicals (medium)\n0\n=== Total EITE allocation requirement\n2021\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nwith enhanced abatement for\nsteel, cement, chemicals (high)\nNote that this approach would be similar, but different in certain crucial respects, to an approach based on “carbon contracts for difference”, as proposed by Agora’ (see Figure 3). Under Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfDs), member states and the EU would essentially provide aid only for the difference between the prevailing ETS carbon price and the breakeven CO2 price for the project. As such the explicit project-based state aid cost for the member states is reduced by the part of the incremental cost-gap that is paid by the value of the free allocation to the installation.\nHowever, the option outlined in this section would be different to the CCfD model described above, because the new low-carbon installation would not receive any free allowances like other conventional installations. As such, the low-carbon projects would not have the possibility to sell their free allocations on the market in order to pay for a part of the incremental cost of the low- carbon technology (i.e. the value represented by the space below the red line in Figure 3). Thus, to help these projects become viable, member states would now have to pay for 100% of incremental cost of the project compared to the conventional ‘high carbon’ competition (i.e. the full strike price in Figure 2).\nhttps www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin2/Projekte/2018/Dekarbonisierun Industrie/164_ A- EW Klimaneutrale-Industrie Studie _WEB.pdf\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nFigure 3.

This will be needed simply in order to kick-start the transition to ultra-low carbon, but currently much more expensive, production technologies — notably in the steel, cement and chemicals sectors.\nHowever, we also see a risk that, by mixing anti-leakage policies with state aid for strategic low- carbon investments, the policy objectives of the respective mechanisms become confused, potentially leading to sub-optimal outcomes. For the sake of clarity of objective and ease of administration, it may therefore be preferable to separate different policies for different policy objectives.\nFor these reasons, Option 1a may be a simpler solution than Option 1b. However, the option to use state aid to replace a part of free allocation, while tying this to investment in abatement measures, could also be considered as a complementary measure, and should thus be evaluated accordingly.\nHowever, it is important to note that both the options 1a and 1b described above would only be temporary. Even an expanded ETS would still need to see allocations decline to zero over time and therefore alternative leakage solutions would be needed. Thus, while these options could allow the EU to extend the current free allocation system of anti-leakage protection for a time, ultimately, an alternative long-term framework would need to be established that superseded these approaches.\nOption 2. Border Carbon Adjustments\nIn our view, the main advantage of border carbon adjustments over the alternatives is that they would work within the framework of the EU ETS and carbon pricing. This may be advantageous if one believes that a) BCAs are implementable for a broad range of sectors and b) that carbon pricing is the\n7\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nprimary policy mechanism by which energy intensive industries will be decarbonised, both in Europe and around the world.\nHowever, both of these assumptions can be questioned. For example, carbon prices in the order of 100 to 200€/tCO2 would be needed to make climate neutral industrial technologies viable from an economic perspective. However, such prices are currently unlikely and politically unfeasible, in Europe, but also in many of the EU’s trading partners. BCAs therefore do not address the more fundamental issue which is that different policies (not only carbon pricing) with different implicit (shadow) carbon prices will be needed to decarbonise industry in Europe itself, let alone abroad. Consequently, the justification that “BCAs allow the EU to raise carbon prices and thus decarbonise industry” is not accurate in our view.\nFigure 4. Comparison of current EU ETS carbon price with the breakeven CO2 prices for key industrial decarbonisation technologies in cement, steel and chemicals sectors\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\nEBEREREE\nEs\nCements w/\nHigh clinker | Cement-high\nCement-\nCement\nMethanol-\nETS Carbon | (LC3+Improv | technology\nMgO-based\nCement-\nelectrificatio Steel-DRI-\nSteel-DRI- Aluminium-\nto-Olefin\nGreen\ned (Smartcrush\n(e.g.\nOxfuel &\nnw/ CCS (50 Natural gas\n|\nH2-water zero carbon\nelectrolysis anodes\n(automated\nHydrogen\nfrom steam\nprice\naggregate er)\nNovacem)\nccs\n€/MWh))\nroute)\npacking)\nMEUR/tCO2 17\n45\n50\n55\n70\n85\n62\n99\n70\n160\n170\nAnother significant drawback of BCAs is that they come with a range of significant political, legal and administrative risks that would need to be resolved.\nSome of these problems may be resolvable, although they would have important implications for the design of the policy instrument. For instance, some of the administrative complexity of assessing CO2 content may be able to be reduced by applying uniform default CO2 benchmarks for products coming into the EU, while allowing companies beating the benchmark to certify their production as having a lower CO2 intensity, and thus paying a lower charge. However, while this would reduce the complexity of the system, it would raise political issues about where to set the benchmark. For example, what would be a fair European benchmark considering potentially less modern plants in some countries than in others around Europe? And how would this be reconciled with what foreign\nAgora\nEnergiewende\ncountries think is a fair set of benchmarks? Would these answers be consistent with the goal of reducing administrative complexity?\nSimilarly, an effective and politically implementable border adjustment would, in our view, require that some form of rebate be given to protect exported energy intensive goods from the EU. It is uncertain whether this would be WTO-compatible. One solution to this eventually would be if free allocation were continued to companies only for the share of their production exported. (This would after all, simply be a continuation of the existing system, which has not been opposed at the WTO after 15 years of the ETS.) However, this would imply that a system for tracing exports back to original producers be established.\nHowever, not all of the challenges raised by BCAs have such obvious solutions. For example, one significant risk is that third countries undermine the effectiveness of the system by engaging in so- called “resource shuffling” of their exported products. Resource shuffling might take three forms:\n1. Where a country would keep its more carbon intensive production for domestic use, while exporting only its cleanest production to Europe. Where a country might export its goods first to a country with lower CO2 intensity, and then ship them to Europe from this country, in the hope of benefiting from a reduced CO2 intensity assessment. Where sectors with complex downstream value chains, such as steel or chemicals, could cease exporting CO2 intensive basic materials to Europe (e.g. steel coils) and instead switch to producing a larger share of the value chain in the non-EU country, before exporting the more complex downstream products (e.g. car doors).\nResource shuffling is likely to be a real risk for other highly traded products, such as steel, aluminium or basic chemicals. In general, the best way for the EU to avoid resource shuffling from undermining the BCA’s effectiveness would be to:\na) Ensure that its domestic production was already world’s best performance in terms of CO2 intensity, b) Include as many downstream products as were administratively feasible in the scope of the system, c) Use common global benchmarks for the default CO2 intensity/product (i.e. not distinguish between countries based on true CO2 intensity) and ensure effective 3\" party verification of product origin where goods sought to claim superior CO2 performance to that benchmark.\nA problem for the EU is that condition a) is not likely to be satisfied for some time (e.g. for steel or chemicals). These considerations suggest that an EU BCA would need to either focus very narrowly on certain products that the EU thinks are less likely to be subject to resource shuffling concerns, or else delay implementation until its domestic production can be significantly decarbonised.\nHowever, in our view, the most significant risks to the implementation of BCAs stem from the significant political challenges that are raised by the mechanism, both internationally and domestically. Internationally, trading partners, such as China or India, either with higher CO2 intensity that the EU average, or who fear creating a precedent for “environmental protectionism”, will object. There is also potential for countries to object or retaliate to the EU’s move in bad faith, as\nAgora\nEnergiewende\na way of seeking leverage in climate or other negotiations, or as a purely populist gesture Furthermore, technical challenges such as where to set benchmarks, or how to impute foreign countries’ domestic carbon regulations into the setting of the border adjustments, might be a cause of dispute and require negotiation\nThe EU would be best placed to withstand these significant challenges where it is confident that it can avoid international isolation and internal division. These conditions are not currently aligned Ideally the EU would be pursuing any BCA by first laying the necessary diplomatic and technical groundwork. Where possible the EU should use the next 5 years to forge agreement on principles for the cooperation on both the decarbonisation and carbon leakage protection of energy intensive industries as part of an international climate coalition. This might be established by beginning first with its other carbon pricing nations and provinces, and as part of the EU’s regional neighbourhood discussions\nDomestically, a key challenge will be to implement a BCA that removes free allocation, and thus exposed producers to the full carbon price. This will be opposed wherever domestic production is not yet at the level of the global best performers. This is the case for several EU sectors, and performance varies across EU member states\nSecondly, some domestic sectors unrelated to the EU ETS may be concerned about the possible impact of retaliation. Thirdly, some sectors may object to a BCA that included their sector, but reserved free allocation to others with whom their products are in competition (e.g. steel vs cement)\nFinally, the removal of free allocation associated with BCAs would also mean that prices in downstream purchasers of energy intensive products would rise. In the long run this is unavoidable under all solutions to the carbon leakage problem. However, any BCA design with a hope of being adopted would need to address these political economy considerations in a robust manner\nIn view of the significant technical and political risks cited above, we believe that border carbon adjustments will be very challenging for the EU to implement unilaterally at the present time for all but a small number of less traded sectors. Moreover, the EU needs more than just higher carbon prices to decarbonise energy-intensive industry, it needs complementary policies, implying a range of different (shadow) CO2 prices in the economy for energy-intensive sectors. It also needs significant efforts to develop infrastructure and lead markets for green products. Therefore, pursuing BCAs in the current context creates a significant risk of undermining and distracting from the larger and more urgent need for a policy package for the decarbonisation of EU energy intensive industries\nOption 3. ETS-linked Consumption-charges for EII products (plus free allocation)\nA third option consists of an approach based on consumption charges’. Under this approach, output- based free allocation would be provided to ETS installations indefinitely. This would provide protection from leakage. However, to restore a carbon price signal along the value chain, a\n> Neuhoff, K (2020) Border Carbon Adjustments and Alternative Measures for the EU ETS An Evaluation https: www.diw.de/documents, ublikationen/73/diw_01.c.743698.de/dp1855.pdf\n10\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nconsumption charge would be applied to all energy-intensive materials once they left the “factory gate” of the ETS installations. The liability for this charge could be passed on down the value chain until either paid by an intermediate producer or the final consumer. The charge would be determined using the following stylized calculation:\nConsumption charge = EU ETS price x the benchmark product CO2 intensity x weight of the materials.\nThe charge would be applied to importers of the relevant products, once the goods were on-sold in the EU market, and removed for exports. Thus, upstream producers would be fully protected at the level of the ETS benchmark. A level playing field would be established between the embedded carbon price in imports, domestic production and an exception applied to exports.\nAn important advantage of this approach is that, since the charge only applies once it enters the consumption sphere for use of Ell products, it is not strictly speaking a border measure. Rather it concerns the regulation of the EU’s internal market. Similar systems already exist for excise charges applied to fuels, tobacco and alcohol in the EU. They are thus administratively feasible and there are precedents suggesting that they would be WTO-compatible, including for the removal of the liability for export. The fact that the charge would be based on the weight of materials (e.g. of steel, aluminium, plastics, etc.) in the product is also intended to simplify the monitoring reporting and verification required for implementation.\nHowever, while a consumption-based approach has a certain appeal, it would unfortunately come with several challenging issues that would require resolution. Firstly, applying a purely weight-based charge would fail to reward businesses (consumers) for producing (consuming) low CO2 products. This would also include recycled and circular products, which would be treated as equivalent in CO2 intensity to primary products. One possible response to this problem might be to allow the installations to sell their excess free allocations on the carbon market, in order to lower their downstream costs. Nonetheless, this would only work so long as free allocation was sustainable...\nSecondly, this system would imply allocating free allocation in perpetuity in order to protect upstream installations in the ETS and to avoid downstream producers and consumers being charged twice for the CO, content of the products they buy. This raises challenging questions about how a declining ETS cap could be recycled with perpetual free allocation at 100% of the benchmark:\nWhen and how would free allocation be phased out? Would these sectors ultimately need to be removed from the ETS? How would the objective of climate neutrality be maintained for these sectors if free allocation was to be continued until 2040 or perhaps 2050? Etc.\nUltimately, therefore, ETS-linked consumption charges might only be able to be a temporary measure to address carbon leakage. In their defence, they could nonetheless potentially be transitioned to carbon product standards or BCAs at a later date, since much of the institutional and MRV architecture would be similar. However, this would imply significant administrative effort to change the current system for only a short-lived solution.\n11\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nThirdly, as a tax-like measure, an ETS-linked consumption charge would likely require unanimity in the European Council in order to be adopted. This raises questions about whether it is politically realistic to consider such an approach.\nFor the above reasons, we believe that an EU ETS-linked consumption charge system also faces challenges to implement, while maintaining a functioning and manageable EU ETS as well as effective incentives for decarbonisation of energy intensive sectors in the EU ETS. In principle, this option could be implemented as a temporary solution on the way to carbon product standards (see Option 4 below). However, doing so may involve significant effort for only temporary utility.\nOption 4. Carbon product standards (for all sales in the EU)\nA third alternative to the anti-leakage options listed above is carbon product standards (CPS).\nUnder this option, the EU would set a sunset date — e.g. by 2035 or 2040 — for all EU installations producing energy intensive goods such as steel, cement or basic chemicals, to meet climate neutrality-compatible, CO2 performance standards. From the sunset date onwards, all sales of carbon-intensive basic materials (and chemicals) in the EU, would need to be certified that were produced in line with these standards. The rules would apply both to imported goods for sale in the EU as well as domestically produced goods. Both types of goods would require certification by approved certifiers (as is currently done under the EU Timber legislation’). Exported products would be exempted, unless corresponding international standards applied.\nIn the intervening time, the EU would continue — on a temporary basis — to provide free allocation along the lines of Option 1b described above. In other words, free allocation would be given at the full conventional technology benchmark, but, each year, an increasing share of installations would be given aid to invest in climate neutral production processes instead of free allocation. Thus, the EU and its member states would in effect be creating the economic conditions and technological capacity for energy intensive industrials to meet ambitious climate neutrality standards by the sunset date. The EU would clearly signal to ETS installations that their free allocation would end completely as of the sunset date, from which standards would apply.\nIn our view, a gradual transition to climate neutral product standards in this manner presents a number of significant advantages over the alternatives:\ne The continuation of free allocation in the short term would require relatively little change to the existing system, while allowing attention to be focused on enabling the actual decarbonisation of EU industrial assets — i.e. the most urgent priority during the next decade. Reduced potential conflicts with WTO law, provided certain basic conditions of non- discrimination and consultation were met (Gerres et al, 2019)”.\n“ Cf. The Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Voluntary Partnership Agreements (FLEGT VPAs) and the EU Timber Regulation (No 995/2010). The latter applies to timber imported from countries without a FLEGT VPA in place.

The policy could begin with the establishment of labelling measures, thus allowing the policy infrastructure to be developed and improved with time on the EU’s side. No risk of resource shuffling or undermining EU competitiveness, since EU installations would already be at the performance standard. Setting a clear objective and vision for the decarbonisation of EU industrial production by 2035-40 would provide investor clarity on what they can and cannot invest in during the next 10 years.\nWhile we believe that an approach based on carbon product standards is the best option of those available, it would nonetheless raise some issues that would need resolving.\nFirst, product standards for steel, aluminium, ceramic and brick, glass, pulp and paper and also basic bulk chemicals are likely to be possible to set at ambitious climate neutrality-compatible levels (i.e. with emissions at or close to zero for the entire sector). However, for some products, such as cement or lime production, it may be more complicated to set a uniform standard that is both ambitious enough for the sector as a whole to be climate neutrality compatible, while accurately reflecting the potential of each specific member state or site to abate. This would suggest that sectors such as cement may need to maintain carbon pricing-based incentives to go beyond the minimum standard for the sector. Such a system would therefore not necessarily completely replace the ETS.\nSecondly, for products which are in competition with each other, such as steel and cement, or steel and aluminium, standards would need to be set at comparable levels of ambition, in order to ensure a level playing field, and policy consistency, between sectors. Where possible, this might be done by setting similar emissions reduction goals (e.g. zero emissions/tonne) and then letting the cheaper climate neutral product have a competitive advantage in competing applications. Alternatively, this may be done by using a common shadow CO2 price, e.g. of 100-150€/tCO2, and determining standards based on the best available technology at that price.\nThirdly, sectoral emissions performance standards could probably be set today based on existing technological knowledge and modelling conducted for the EU’s long-term strategic vision for a climate neutral economy. However, the exact sunset date and level of the standards would need to be reviewed and updated prior to taking effect, to take stock of the latest available knowledge. Reviews in 2025, 2030 might therefore be needed. Even if deadlines or the exact level of standards were adjusted over time, care would be needed to create expensive stranded, non-climate neutrality compatible assets.\nFinally, as in the case of BCAs, product standards have the potential to create winners and losers beyond the EU’s borders. As in the case of border adjustments, setting standards would require the EU to provide adequate forewarning and consultation of WTO partners in order not be perceived as de facto discrimination under WTO law. As in the case of BCAs, we believe that the EU would be wise to pursue forms of international cooperation, including coalitions of nations engaging in carbon pricing. This could help to prepare the diplomatic ground for the implementation of such a policy, even if ultimately the EU should reserve the right to act on its own.\n13\nAgora\nEnergiewende\nOn balance, we believe that the most desirable, and effective, approach to provide medium and long-term carbon leakage protection is to pursue carbon product standards.\n4. Conclusions\nThe EU discussion on anti-carbon leakage measures must not be allowed to distract from or undermine the broader and extremely urgent objective of putting energy intensive industry onto a pathway towards climate neutrality by 2050. This risk is very high if the EU pursues border levelling of CO2 prices as the only solution to carbon leakage, especially in the present political and economic context.\nWe believe BCAs, if pursued in isolation to other solutions, and unilaterally by the EU, would encounter substantial domestic and international political opposition. This risk is currently unnecessary to take at the present moment: the current system of benchmark based free allocation can, with reforms linked to an extension of the ETS scope and perhaps complementary state aid policies for industry to decarbonise, be reformed to function effectively until at least the mid-2030s.\nHowever, in the long-term — i.e. sometime between 2035 and 2040 - the system of free allocation will become unsustainable, as free allocation would consume 100% or more of total EU ETS cap. Even if decarbonised in future, climate neutral EU industries will still face higher production costs than conventional technologies. By this time, the EU will therefore need to shift to a longer-term solution than free allocation.\nThe EU will therefore need to choice between one or some combination of three basic long-term alternatives. Since Border carbon adjustments are not an end in themselves, and since there may be scope to combine different options over time and across sectors, the Commission should explore other options, as well as ways that they might be combined, as part of an effective long term strategy.\nIn our view, the approach with the most desirable characteristics from a WTO legal, administrative simplicity, and political-economy perspective would be for the EU to announce and then pursue a transition to climate-neutral carbon product standards for energy intensive basic materials (also applied to imported products). This would require some of the certification and MRV infrastructure of BCAs, but would also come with a range of advantages in terms of administrative and legal simplicity, communication, and effectiveness for investment in climate neutral technologies.\nClimate-neutral product standards could be set based on existing technological knowledge and enter into force between 2035-40, thus providing clarity for industrial investment today and replacing free allocation from that date.\nWhether it opts for carbon product standards, BCAs, or ETS-linked consumption charges, or some combination thereof, the EU will still need to develop MRV and certification systems. It will also need to work with international trading partners to prepare the diplomatic and technical groundwork, for long-term anti-leakage solutions to be implemented. This technical and diplomatic work represent “no regret” measures that the EU could and must undertake during the next 5 years.\n14\nAgora 'Q, Energiewende\n15"

Members of the Association are actively engaged in the international trade importing to the major steel markets, including to the EU. This is why the currently proposed unilateral and sector-specific CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) raises serious concerns within the Association. \nThe CBAM is designed specifically to fight carbon leakage. Carbon leakage is defined as a situation where, due to growing environmental costs, such as EU ETS costs, EU businesses (1) loose EU and export markets in favour of cheaper carbon-intensive products, and (2) move production/investments to countries with lower or no emission reduction ambition and respective costs. \nEsteemed independent economists identify fundamental issues which completely remove the CBAM from the declared EU climate agenda and even the levelling playing field agenda, the latter being the main historical driver for the CBAM. In particular, economists credibly argue that carbon leakage is a far-fetched, if not a non-existent, issue because growing ETS costs are just a minor factor for businesses to move abroad. The economists further identify such serious issues as carbon absorption, source shifting and market distorting signals due to promotion of cost saving replacement of (1) imports of semi-finished goods or raw materials, such as steel slabs or billets for re-rolling/processing in the EU, with more value added finished goods, and (2) more expensive CBAM covered products with competing products of a CBAM non-covered sector with the same or even higher carbon footprint. The latter may have devastating effects on certain EU sectors and sub-sectors of economy, particularly downstream manufacturers.  \nThe above issues strongly indicate that the currently proposed CBAM does not serve its very purpose because it cannot fight carbon leakage, even if such phenomenon existed to the extent it is presented by some stakeholders. Moreover, such CBAM is likely to increase emissions in third countries. We know that the negative climate effect is the same regardless of whether CO2 emissions come from the EU, China or the USA. \nEsteemed international trade lawyers side with the economists cited above and loudly warn us that the proposed CBAM will lead to trade wars and further negative consequences for the EU economy due to massive and immediate retaliation of EU’s major trading partners. \nThe EU intends to ascertain that the CBAM is fully WTO compliant. In such a case, a CBAM needs to be introduced and applied in the form of a carbon charge/levy/tax on all imported and domestic products with the same or similar carbon footprint per unit, depending upon such content and irrespective of an industrial sector. \nA WTO incompliant CBAM will be successfully challenged in the WTO, and EU’s trading partners will introduce massive retaliatory measures affecting various sectors of the EU economy. This retaliation may be immediate because the EU CBAM is likely to be treated as a disguised safeguard measure not compliant with the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. It is noteworthy that the EU rightly took this view with regard to the recent US Section 232 measures on steel and aluminium. \nTo conclude, we are deeply concerned that the proposed unilateral and sector-specific CBAM does not serve the purpose and may turn out to be even counterproductive for both the climate change and competitiveness of EU industries. We invite all stakeholders to engage into an advanced dialogue and cooperation with a view to find the right way to achieve industrial decarbonisation in the EU and elsewhere. We believe that the EU and other industrial jurisdictions should jointly lead to create a binding multilateral mechanism to achieve decarbonisation of our planet. \n",

The situation is even more critical as regards those sectors which, due to the nature of the activities put in place, envisage a shift between different countries. Think of maritime and air transport, and the ease with which ships and planes could go to refuel in countries where fuel taxation is lower.\nThis would mean a risk of relocation of carbon emissions. If this risk materializes, there will be no reduction in global emissions and this will frustrate the efforts of the EU and its industries to achieve the global climate objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nIt follows that, as rightly highlighted in the Green New Deal, the adoption of useful tools to limit this phenomenon, known as carbon leakage, must be a European priority to ensure the overall sustainability of the standards that will be launched.\nIn this regard, the Commission has proposed to insert a mechanism to counter this risk by setting a carbon price on imports of certain goods outside the EU. It is therefore a question of inserting a carbon border tax going to check and quantify the ecological footprint of individual products.\nEvaluation\nA tax on carbon border seems to be a necessary step towards a decarbonisation of the European economy.\nHowever, firstly, it is necessary to verify the legal and technical feasibility of each measure which will have to be carefully evaluated, also in relation to the EU trade acquis (the rules of the World Trade Organization and EU trade agreements) and other international commitments.\nTechnically, the European Commission proposes a \"carbon border adjustment mechanism\" that would protect EU companies from cheaper imports from countries with weaker climate policies.\nThis mechanism would not be applied until at least 2021 and could take the form of a levy on imported goods, based on average prices in the EU emissions trading scheme, although other options are possible.\nIn any case, the idea is conceptually shareable. First of all, it would stop the so-called \"reallocation of carbon emissions\", when climate action in one country pushes polluters to move to another and overall emissions remain virtually unchanged.\nThe mechanism would then have the effect of making domestic and European companies more competitive than international competitors, thus enhancing the supply chains and employment on the EU territory while ensuring a reduction of CO2 emissions equivalent globally.\nAnalyzing the economies of the European states, it is evident that the product category that would be most affected would be the technological products, to date almost entirely from Asian countries.\nThis would lead to a generalized increase in prices for many products. It is therefore necessary for the Commission to carry out a careful assessment of the possible impact in terms of contraction in consumption and to provide for compensation mechanisms so that there are no excessive effects on the final consumer.\nIn this regard, it is necessary to select the sectors subject to this measure. It will therefore be necessary to define an area in terms of sectors concerned to ensure that the measure applies where the risk of carbon leakage is greater, also going to avoid excessive penalties for those sectors already subject to the ETS mechanism or for which there are no European markets.\nFrom an international point of view, it is noted that such a mechanism could induce countries and companies to adopt more stringent environmental policies, so as to avoid a contraction in sales on the European market.\nHowever, it should be stressed the idea that there are also different environmental realities within the same Union. Countries, like Italy, traditionally have strict and complete environmental protection legislation; they are characterized by a high rate of waste recycling, as well as by a high circularity rate; they have integrated renewable energy sources into the national energy mix, encouraging their diffusion. This inevitably entails greater burdens for companies both from the point of view of labor costs, and of raw materials and environmental requirements.\nOn the other hand, there are Member States, especially those from Eastern Europe, which maintain rather low levels of sustainable development and not in line with European guidelines. In these countries, in fact, there is a deficient environmental law, as well as high levels of dependence on fossil sources.\nMany times the so-called delocalization do not in fact concern countries outside the EU, but precisely these latter Member States which allow industries to remain within the borders of the Union, with the relative benefits, and at the same time reduce their costs for compliance with environmental legislation, for work and raw materials.\nThe Commission should therefore urgently and preliminarily tackle this problem, within its borders, and then turn to the international market through the tools presented."

In particular, it shall cover not only global international commitments. Lie Paris Accord, but other regional and bilateral arrangements on cooperation in environment, sustainable development, energy and trade, e.g. Ukrainian commitments on approximation of its legislation to the EU acquis in relevant spheres under the Energy Community Treaty or the Association Agreement.\nThe timing of adoption of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is relevant as well. It is obvious that the economy of the European Union will be detrimentally hit because of COVID-19 outbreak. Many people will lose their jobs and many enterprises will be out of business. It therefore is crucial that the national governments together with the European Commission design an appropriate set of measures to help revive the economy and support employment and prioritize these over other initiatives.\nSteel sector is already having trouble with many manufacturing activities being put on hold or completely stopped. \nIn such circumstances it is essential to ensure that steel consuming businesses maintain access to various sources of supply (both produced in the EU and imported ones), and, more importantly, that prices are not increased and competition remains active. This is also true for many other sectors where international trade is intensive.\nConcluding, Carbon border adjustment mechanism as a mechanism oriented for better environment for next generations should not lead to development gaps between the EU and its neighbors. Climate change policy of the EU should in general be oriented on economic and environmental cohesion with neighboring states sharing policy goals with the EU.\n",

Discussions are also taking place at European level to ensure that the Union has the same objective. This implies a significant change in our decarbonisation rate since French emissions have fallen by only 19 % since 1990. To achieve this, local, national and European public authorities are thinking of new patterns of action.\nThis is a certainty: The cost of fighting climate change will increase in the coming years in France and in Europe. Various public policies are intended to evolve, including carbon pricing, which brings together the national carbon tax and the European market for emission allowances, covering almost all of the country’s emissions. This logically raises concerns about the competitiveness of the industry, in competition with companies located in countries with a climate policy so far less ambitious, in particular the USA, China and the major emerging countries.\nIn this context, the aim of this note is to provide a summary of the empirical economic literature on the impact of carbon pricing on industrial competitiveness. It also proposes a reflection on accompanying measures, support for the competitiveness and mitigation of carbon leakage, which could be considered. The bias of the authors is not about the relevance of the carbon pricing itself, but rather of taking it as it is and of considering its foreseeable consequences for the industry.",

For that, large investments into new technologies are needed, and first movers into these technologies require certainty about carbon prices in order to build successful business cases. In some cases, they may also need additional public support to address the innovation market externalities. Carbon contracts for differences (CCFDs) with national governments or institutions can secure a fixed carbon strike price (e.g. 50-70 Euro/tCO2) over a given time period (e.g. 15-20 years) for individual projects and hence help to make these novel processes a competitive alternative. As such, they can act as hedging instruments against the uncertainty of future carbon prices, and also as a vehicle for additional support for low-carbon industrial technologies.\n\nA consumption-based approach, which also maintains the free allocation of allowances, is well aligned with CCfDs, which ensure that the allowances received can be converted into income at a fixed rate and hence support the business case. Also, for the hedging costs of CCfD to be reasonable, a credible long-term carbon pricing scheme, such as the one provided by inclusion of consumption in the ETS, is essential.",

That being said, the lime industry is a strong supporter of and invests continuously in carbon footprint reduction technologies; these investments and the viability of our industry should be protected.\n\n•\tContext \nThe Paris Agreement is the cornerstone of an ambitious global program to address climate change mitigation. Avoiding carbon leakage is, in this context, essential from an environmental point of view: it ensures that companies financially contribute to the low-carbon transition without running the risk of being unfairly competed out. Against that background, the lime industry supports efficient mechanisms that protect EU major industrial sectors from unfair competition from outside of the EU (where competitors do not bear the cost of CO2). The following insights aim to support the efficiency of a future Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA).\n\n•\tProblem the initiative aims to tackle\n\nA CBA should be introduced in a fair manner: as such, it is essential to identify the drivers of production displacement, and the CBA should be applied down at the product level.\n\nIt is equally essential to ensure that any CBA considers the global context of carbon leakage and production displacement.\n\nTo avoid any long-term effect on the structure of EU imports, the CBA mechanism should take into account the full GHG-related content of imported goods across value chain (from the creation to the importation of the product, including transport).\n\n•\tLikely economic impacts\nEuLA supports the necessity to analyse the situation with regards to the overall value chain. Some sectors are crucial to be maintained in Europe because they create prosperity upwards and downwards. The IA should define these sectors and suggest specific protective measures, due to the key impact they have in the whole EU industry (steel might be a good example). \n\nThe CBA shall also provide legal certainty, i.e. the carbon leakage list and the free allowances as a consequence, should remain intact for its intended duration.\n\n•\tLikely impacts on simplification and/or administrative burden\n\nThe IA must analyse in detail the different elements of the administrative system to protect against import and equally, not to penalise export.\n\nInternational standards (e.g. ISO) should, when they exist, be applied to domestic and external production importing to Europe in order to evaluate the carbon footprint of a product and make them comparable.\n\n•\tPreserving the internal market\nThe CBA mechanism must avoid any distortion of competition or discrimination between domestic production of competing products in the EU market.\n\nWhen evaluating the selection of different sectors that could be subject to the CBA, the IA should closely analyse this risk of distortion of competition.

That being said, the lime industry is a strong supporter of and invests continuously in carbon footprint reduction technologies; these investments and the viability of our industry should be protected.\ne Context\nThe Paris Agreement is the cornerstone of an ambitious global program to address climate change mitigation. Avoiding carbon leakage is, in this context, essential from an environmental point of view: it ensures that companies financially contribute to the low-carbon transition without running the risk of being unfairly competed out. Against that background, the lime industry supports efficient mechanisms that protect EU major industrial sectors from unfair competition from outside of the EU (where competitors do not bear the cost of CO2). The following insights aim to support the efficiency of a future Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA).\ne Problem the initiative aims to tackle\nA CBA should be introduced in a fair manner: as such, it is essential to identify the drivers of production displacement, and the CBA should be applied down at the product level.\nBeside the overarching climate commitments of non-EU countries, similar products in these countries may indeed fall under different regime of environmental standards: product A may not bear any carbon cost (or a much lower one that the EU ETS price) while product B may be under a similar carbon burden. In this example, there may a risk of displacement for product A from the EU to non-EU countries, while product B would not be displaced.\nIt is equally essential to ensure that any CBA considers the global context of carbon leakage and production displacement.\nFacing carbon leakage, European producers may lose their market share being be forced to close and promote a non-intended carbon leakage either:\ne In their domestic market share because that has been captured by a non-EU producer which imports the product with higher carbon intensity; or In a non-EU country where they were exporting, because its market has been captured by a local producer having much less carbon constraints.\nAccordingly, the CBA mechanism should both:\ne Be applied for imports from countries without (or limited) carbon constraints, as well as e Exempt domestic EU-producers exporting in countries with significant lower carbon constraints.\nTo avoid any long-term effect on the structure of EU imports, the CBA mechanism should take into account the full GHG-related content of imported goods across value chain (from the creation to the importation of the product, including transport).\nShould only the raw materials or semi-finished products be subject to the CBA, imports to the EU will likely change to finished products — with a very detrimental impact on the EU’s manufacturing sector.\nEuropean Lime Association aisbl, in short “EuLA”\nEstablished under the Belgian law under the enterprise/ VAT number BE0479.082.505 C/o IMA-Europe, Twin Gardens (6° floor), rue des Deux Eglises 26, Box 2, B - 1000 Brussels, Belgium Tel: 32 2 210 44 10, E-mail: secretariat@ima-europe.eu, https://www.eula.eu/\nww\nww\nEuropean Lime Association A.1.S.B.L.\nww\nEULA\nAssociation Européenne de la Chaux\nWw\nWw\nEuropaischer Kalkverband\nWoe We\nMember of IMA-Europe\nThis will require having access to a full, accurate, harmonised and comparable dataset and to have full knowledge of the regulatory regime of the country from which the product is imported.\ne Likely economic impacts\nEuLA supports the necessity to analyse the situation with regards to the overall value chain. Some sectors are crucial to be maintained in Europe because they create prosperity upwards and downwards. The IA should define these sectors and suggest specific protective measures, due to the key impact they have in the whole EU industry (steel might be a good example).\nThe CBA Shall also provide legal certainty, i.e. the carbon leakage list and the free allowances as a consequence, should remain intact for its intended duration.\ne Likely impacts on simplification and/or administrative burden\nThe IA must analyse in detail the different elements of the administrative system to protect against import and equally, not to penalise export.\nThe IA must also look deeply at the complexity of the system: different products from a same country might have different regimes for import/export. For example, electricity from Algeria produced only with solar panels would be exempted while cement should be refrained due to lack of advance technology in carbon reducing techniques.\nInternational standards (e.g. ISO) should, when they exist, be applied to domestic and external production importing to Europe in order to evaluate the carbon footprint of a product and make them comparable.\nThese standards should, whenever possible, replace the current burdensome monitoring and reporting guidelines. This would lead to a simplification for EU producers, especially for SMEs, and lesser costs\ne Preserving the internal market\nThe CBA mechanism must avoid any distortion of competition or discrimination between domestic production of competing products in the EU market.\nWhen evaluating the selection of different sectors that could be subject to the CBA, the IA should closely analyse this risk of distortion of competition. Lime, for example, is a strong competitor of some chemicals, with a relatively similar carbon footprint; if a CBA for lime reduces its level of free allowances, a distortion of competition in the EU domestic market will be generated without appropriate justification.\n-----------------\nEuLA, the European Lime Association, represents about 95% of the European non-captive lime production through its 21 national member associations. The European lime sector operates around 160 sub-installations covering 436 kilns in the EU, producing a total of 22 million tons of lime and dolime (2016), and contributing around € 2,5 billion to Europe’s GDP. Lime is an essential but often unseen ingredient, which possesses many applications for downstream industries. As a strong \"enabler\", lime is used from steel to water treatment and pharmaceuticals, environmental protection, glass and paper\nindustrial processes, in the construction and civil engineering and in agriculture.\neK He\nEuropean Lime Association aisbl, in short “EuLA”\nEstablished under the Belgian law under the enterprise/ VAT number BE0479.082.505 C/o IMA-Europe, Twin Gardens (6° floor), rue des Deux Eglises 26, Box 2, B - 1000 Brussels, Belgium Tel: 32 2 210 44 10, E-mail: secretariat@ima-europe.eu, https://www.eula.eu/"

        "feedback": "Kayrros (https://www.kayrros.com/), a European company leading in Earth observation analytics, welcomes practical solutions with a global dimension to address the reduction of GHG emission, such as the setting of a carbon border adjustment mechanism. Such a mechanism should be crafted in a way that encourages large-scale long-term investments in a net-zero emissions economy.\n\nThe carbon border adjustment mechanism could effectively reduce GHG emissions if it is based upon a performance-based system for both imports and domestic energy products. This means tracking and aggregating data on emissions stemming from at least the production of oil and natural gas, gas associated with oil production and handling, gas transmission, distribution and consumption, but also from active and decommissioned coal mines.\n\nThe technologies and methodologies for determining the accurate footprint of the energy products imported into the European Union are already available. To a large extent, their readiness is due to the Union’s long-term vision in the area of space policy, which established the Copernicus Sentinel program for multi-spectral imaging instruments for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Access to satellite imagery, coupled with algorithmic processing and other types of data, enable the accurate measurement and reporting of GHG emissions along specific countries and value chains. This increased visibility can make it possible to differentiate among suppliers in the affected sectors (steel, cement, aluminum, etc.) according to their GHG intensity, measured in kg of CO2 equivalent per tonne. Moreover, under such a system, the carbon footprint of imports would be updated on a daily basis so that taxation at the border can adjust to changes in the production process outside the EU.\nThis approach has been recognized by the International Energy Agency (IEA), among other bodies. Their latest report on methane emissions (see https://bit.ly/39yx3ms) quotes several insights from Kayrros, including the identification of approximately 100 high volume-emitting events at any one time around the world. Together, in the course of one year, these events are releasing 20 megatons of methane which is equivalent to 1.8 gigatons of CO2 (based on a GWP of 20 years). Through its proprietary attribution model, Kayrros can identify that around one half of that amount, or 1 gigaton, are in regions with heavy industry such as oil & gas, coal mining, etc. This would be equivalent to the total annual CO2 emissions of Germany and France together. Moreover, the data shows significant variations in the GHG intensity of different producers, many of which are currently supplying the European market.\n\nMethane emissions can therefore be detected and quantified at an asset level on a global scale, which represents a major step-change in the ability to work towards the reduction of man-made emissions. \n\nSimilar measurements and analyses models can be applied for CO2 and NO2 emissions on a global scale. \n\nIn this context, the establishment of a performance-based system for imports is a pragmatic and handy approach to reducing emissions.\nIn addition to the enforcement approach of a carbon border adjustment mechanism, the EU could also look at ways of testing and deploying measurement and quantification tools through international cooperation, with organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) or third countries. The goal would be to ensure that any other similar mechanisms are modelled upon the EU’s own performance-based system.\n\nContact details:\nAntoine Rostand, Founder and Chairman, a.rostand@kayrros.com\nBéatrice de Clermont-Tonerre, bct@kayrros.com",

As Chair of the Federal Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection (bvek) e.V. (German Emissions Trading Association) on behalf of the Federal Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection, I supported such meachnism at a meeting at the European Commission’s House in Berlin in 2008 (see http://www.bvek.de/symposium/symposium_2008-06.html ). In the meantime, the Bvek has repeatedly given detailed reasons and concrete expressions for this support: \n(2014: Http://www.bvek.de/symposium/beitraege/Hacker%20-%20bvek-Vorschlaege%201%20-%2027-06-14.pdf\n2015: Http://www.bvek.de/downloads/S2015_bvek-aktuelle-Probleme_10-06-15.pdf\n2016: Http://www.bvek.de/symposium/beitraege/7-Hacker-ETS-nach-2020.pdf )\n\nI have also made available to some German MEPs in 2016 a detailed amendment to the EU Directive, as set out in the annex. \nIn the recitals, I pointed out that the existing rules to avoid the risk of carbon leakage (CL) by generous allocation of free emission allowances to sectors/sub-sectors at risk of that risk have eliminated, but at the same time generated significant windfall profits. The Bvek proposal ensures, in full compliance with WTO rules, a level playing field both within and outside the EU while eliminating the risk of windfall profits.\n\nAll EU emission allowances should in principle be auctioned in the future, but in order to avoid CL risk, all importers of products in sectors/sub-sectors where there is a relevant CL risk should also be required to purchase EU allowances and surrender them to the competent authorities according to their actual import volumes multiplied by average benchmarks for the relevant products. At the same time, all exporters of the same product categories should be allocated allowances free of charge according to their actual export volumes multiplied by the same benchmarks. As the benchmarks for importers and exporters are identical, all relevant WTO rules are respected, in particular non-discrimination between foreign and domestic producers.\n\nPlease refer to the Annex for all further explanations and details of the proposal for a regulation. Although the proposal in the Annex refers to the EU Directive as at 2016 for the article numbers, it can be easily adapted to the current EU Directive.\n\nUnlike the levying of a border tax, the obligation to surrender EU emission allowances ensures that, for each emission allowance price over time, the burden between ‘nationals of the EU’ and ‘non-nationals of the EU’ is automatically fair. By contrast, this can never be achieved with a tax, whatever the specific rate is fixed.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the intended change to the EU rules under the Green Deal should also address the two other main weaknesses of the EU ETS and the EU’s climate change policy. Indeed, there should be a gradual extension of the EU ETS to all EU greenhouse gas emissions, starting with transport emissions in the short term, and a reform of the use of the proceeds from the auctioning of EU emissions allowances (distribution per capita to EU citizens). \n\nJürgen Hacker (Chairman of the Bvek 2005-2011 and 2014-201)",

And I proposed in this report the introduction of a carbon adjustment mechanism, the report had been supported by a large majority in 2015. \nThe idea is to establish a fair system between all industrial competitors. Europe cannot impose a right to pollute only on the companies present in its territory (even if I agree with the polluter pays principle) and close the eyes on all imports which are not subject to any carbon constraints. The risk is to relocate industries and jobs and import pollution. With this system of carbon border adjustment, Europe sends a virtuous message to all industrial players (European and non-European), ‘less polluting and fewer you will have to buy CO2 allowances’, it is good for your competitiveness, good for jobs and, above all, good for the planet and biodiversity. \nEurope could initiate this mechanism to products that are subject to the ETS, and then in the course of progress, extending it to other manufactured products. We see that carbon costs are an important factor in global competitiveness, Europe cannot do as if competition were only within Europe. I would point out, in contrast to all those who say the opposite, that there is nothing more simply to trace the seedlings produced (base metals for example), that is an obligation in the manufacturing process and required by customers. The latter wish to know the whole process from the beginning to the end of the manufacturing process (technical data sheet necessary to trace the product’s life in the event of a quality problem, for example). It would therefore be sufficient to use a supplementary line in the technical data sheet to provide information on the CO2 emissions of that product.",

As the fight against climate change needs to be global, the measure can be an opportunity for the EU to project its climate leadership globally. It is equally important to consider the EU's existing internal climate targets (by 2030, and climate neutrality potentially by 2050). When designing the measure, it is therefore important to consider the impacts of the measure on both these EU internal targets (greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy production), and global CO, reduction ambitions, and \"to prevent environmental harm\" as stated in the inception report.\nRegardless of the policy instruments suggested by the Commission in the report (i.e. a carbon tax on selected products — both on imported and domestic products; a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports; the extension of the EU ETS to imports), what is paramount is that the measure should enable a level playing field in which the ‘polluter pays' — a cornerstone of EU environmental policy enshrined in Art 191 TFEU.\nFor the steel sector in particular, the final measure then needs to do two things: 1 The scope of the measure needs to cover the full steel value chain 2. The measure needs to enable an individual exporter adjustment\nWith regards to the first point, the scope of the measure needs to include the full steel value chain, from finished products to upstream raw materials. Both direct and indirect CO, emissions also need to be included to prevent further carbon leakage, even when the indirect segment is not yet subject to EU ETS.\nAccording to the UN's 2019 Global Resources Outlook, resource extraction and processing account for half of the world's carbon emissions.\" In addition, according to the OECD, raw materials use is expected to double by 2060.’ Failing to include the entire value chain would lead to a potential increase in imports of carbon-intensive non-taxed products like coke, pig iron, directly reduced iron (DRI) or other products, and could increase rather than reduce carbon leakage. Choosing to cover one part of the value chain but not others would also disrupt the level playing field within the EU industry: segments of the industry would be advantaged over the other which is not acceptable from a policy perspective (technology/product neutrality).\n*\nEuractiv (2019), 'Resource extraction responsible for half world’s carbon emissions',\nhttps www.euractiv.com/section/circular-economy/news/resource-extraction-responsible-for-half-worlds-\ncarbon-emissions/\n*\nOECD (2018), 'Raw materials use to double by 2060 with severe environmental consequences’, https www.oecd.org/environment/raw-materials-use-to-double-by-2060-with-severe-environmental- consequences.htm\nOn the second point, adherent to the ‘polluter pays' principle, it is critical that 'cleaner' third- country producers importing steel into the EU should be taxed less, and / or third-country producers with a CO, footprint lower than the EU benchmark (however it is calculated) should be exempted. For example, a third-country integrated steel producer performing better than an average EU integrated producer should be taxed less or exempted when they import into the EU.\nThe ‘polluter pays’ principle could also be used to adjust the mechanism to incentivise producers whose CO; footprint is better than that of the average EU producer, setting a clear stimulus for decarbonisation. This setup would not only contribute to negative carbon leakage (reducing emissions elsewhere), but also ensure that the EU preserves its capacity to achieve its internal climate targets, by stimulating a material import flow of cleaner materials from third regions.\nWithout an individual adjustment, a 'one-size-fits-all' mechanism applied to third-country producers exporting to the EU, would be discriminatory towards ‘cleaner’ third-country producers who have already invested in lowering emissions, and would not lead to better global CO, mitigating outcomes. On the contrary, a flat tax for example without an individual adjustment would benefit importers with the lowest costs, including lower investments in CO, reductions. Moreover, such a mechanism could result in substitution of more expensive ‘cleaner’ steel (their price already including abatement costs) with cheaper products manufactured by companies with less ambitious decarbonisation efforts. To keep their market share and remain price-competitive, cleaner producers would be forced to reduce their R&D and/or stop investing in decarbonisation efforts, slowing down global CO. mitigation progress.\nThe measure outlined in the above requires establishing a universal standardised CO, certification methodology and an independent universal verification system to allow for an individual company to prove they are eligible for the tax reduction or exemption. We believe it should be modelled after the EU ETS and therefore be producer-based. The burden of proof would be on the producer, and ideally it should be an automatic ex-ante system to prevent the need for a complex administration, avoiding barriers to trade.\nAbout Laminoirs des Landes (LDL)\nLaminoirs des Landes (LDL) originally was a greenfield project put on hold due to the crisis for several years until its main shareholder, Spanish Hierros Afion holding 60%, decided to invest on it and as a consequence was able to start its operations in Spring of 2.018. LDL then faced the basic problems of every greenfield project with the lack of Know-how which in this case had the added difficulty of a not so well designed facility with many constraints that had to be overcame with additional effort and investments. Total investment in LDL is around 60 million €.\nFinally in 2.020, if current Covid19 crisis allows, LDL will finally look forward to the monthly (just monthly) breakeven point at some point in Q4.\nIn any case future is yet to be seen LDL competitiveness in form of more expensive raw materials supply while having to compete with Integrated Steel plants.\nA fair system to reduce Carbon emissions will be more than welcome by LDL, not just a system to reduce its potential presence in the market."

We clearly see the benefits of the current Emissions Trading System, including the strong policy commitment, the effective price formation on the markets as a function of supply and demand, and the increasing certainty that emissions will fall below a predetermined emissions target because of the emission cap decline. In addition, the EU ETS has contributed to a significant increase in awareness about the environmental cost of carbon emissions.\n\nHowever, we feel, in line with the Inception Impact Assessment, that a few improvements could be considered. \nA further extension of the scope of the EU would significantly improve the effectiveness of the system. Starting with energy-intensive industries (e.g. steel, cement, chemicals etc.) for piloting purposes and then applying it to all other sectors will be key for prudent expansion of the EU ETS.  We estimate that, given a balanced allocation of new carbon rights, this could boost price formation and the impact on the real economy. \nCarbon leakage could, consistently with the direction of thinking of the European Commission, be a threat to the European ambitions regarding climate change and could unintentionally hamper EU production. A carbon border adjustment mechanism, with the appropriate design, could solve this problem. AACB feels that a new carbon customs duty, complementary to the EU ETS would be the most sensible approach. However, we would like to stress that it is of utmost importance that the methodology of such an import duty is designed carefully, technically feasible, and does not unnecessarily hamper EU economic performance. \n\nFew considerations/improvements that are important to note: \n\n1 The volatile price of EU ETS, especially in the early days, has limited the effectiveness of EU ETS in reducing the CO2 emissions in Europe as it could not provide full investment certainty. This price volatility has been driven by not only the policy reforms, but also fuel prices, Europe-wide heatwaves, the trading strategies of large generators, and the active management of EUAs by small industry players. For example, with this price volatility, a price floor, both on the EU ETS and the new carbon duty, can provide investment certainty although it does not necessarily result in further emission savings. \n\n2 National policies of member states also contributed to the price evolution of EUAs and its effectiveness. Tightening the ETS cap has proven to be effective in helping phase out some of the fossil fuels but national policy is important to complement EU ETS to incentivise low carbon build-out. A successful expansion of the scope of the EU ETS is conditional on a balanced allocation of new carbon rights.\n\n3 Auctioning versus free allocation is another important feature of the EU ETS market mechanism. Sectors’ benchmarks calculation can allow a comparative analysis between different importers and as such a fair allocation of emission credits while limiting any surplus accumulation or pass through behavior. In addition, a continuous update of the system of free allocation to focus on sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage will be crucial. \n\n4 Having an infrastructure to monitor, report and verify emissions from different parts of the supply chain is crucial for proper allocation of credits and penalization in case of non-compliance. \n\nThe European Commission is taking a major step to design a working Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to create a level playing field for all producers by exposing them to similar emission reduction requirements. However, it remains crucial that the EU takes into account the risk of carbon leakage, the vulnerability and data reliability of some developing countries, the EU ETS price volatility and investment certainty, the allocation of emission credits, etc.",

CBAM should limit the net electricity import form third countries not applying carbon price measures comparable with the EU ETS.\nAccording to the Commission’s communication, achievement of net-zero economy would require to increase annual investments by up to EUR 575bn\". Although the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in rapid drop in carbon prices, we can assume that the price of CO2 emission allowances (EUA) is expected to increase due to the ambitious EU climate and energy policy up to 76 EUR‘t till 20302. It will particularly affect Member States which are struggling with the biggest challenges and are less advanced in the energy transition. PKEE draws Commission attention to the fact that according to the CAKE study, sole transformation of the Polish electricity sector will need as much as EUR 176 — 206bn and it would not be possible without strong financial support.\nAs far as it has not been decided yet how to use any possible revenues resulting from the carbon border adjustment mechanism application we would like to underline that funds collected through EU carbon border adjustment mechanism can ensure fresh money which can be transferred to Member States with the biggest investment needs.\nNew mechanism should cover import of electricity from third countries\nDecision on covering specific sector by the carbon border adjustment mechanism will deeply impact functioning of sector(s) concerned and therefore should be preceded by thorough Impact Assessment. As some analysis suggest that CBAM could replace the carbon leakage mechanism which are already applied, increasing vulnerability of the energy-intensive industry, possible replacement should be thoroughly assessed to avoid any unfair treatment of the energy-intensive users across the EU.\nPKEE opts for covering by this instrument imports of electricity from third countries not subjected to the EU ETS carbon pricing rules.

Many dairy companies — be they small or big — all across our Union are making tremendous efforts to translate the European environmental and climate ambition into dairy reality (see for instance the zero net carbon initiatives, the Dairy Sustainability Framework or our EDA Dairy Product Environmental Footprint project).\nThe European dairy industry has a long history in providing essential nutrition, caring for animals and shaping the landscape. Dairy is a role model for circularity at production and processing level. We are proud of our contribution to the UN sustainable development goals and have summarised our aims in our > Dairy sustainability synopsis.\nWe share and support the European ambitions that are in line with our defined goals and we prepared the environmental methodology for footprinting to achieve the necessary further quantitative improvement in the years to come.\nWe ask the EU institutions to build a coherent and consistent framework for actions, to alleviate evitable legal burden, protect the functioning of our European Single Market and build a better societal foundation with scientific sound base and encompassing all most relevant indicators for change.\nOur pillars remain three qualitative, plus an economic one:\nEnvironment\nDairy is an important actor for climate and the environment. EDA is proud to highlight the relevance of dairy in the wide context of environmental actions — including climate but looking to the broader picture with water and land uses, biodiversity and animal welfare.\nNutrition\nThe nutritional benefits of dairy are easily highlighted by many examples; especially the EU School food scheme support and the central place in all existing dietary recommendations — all age groups should be eating dairy between 2 and 4 times a day and each can choose what products suit them best. Dairy also allows the huge benefit of converting inedible plant material like grass into highly nutritious products for humans and thus help nourishing the European and world population.\n*\neda’\n4\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\nSociety\nThe social role as core actor in rural areas, especially many with geographical challenges is much recognised but not yet enough highlighted. Without dairying many rural areas would bear any economic actor — the animals and the milk processing industry guarantee jobs, education and health infrastructure all across rural Europe.\nEconomy\nIn an economic perspective, the baseline of all action and change must be the economic viability. EDA supports profitability and growth for all parts of the chain, and that improvements are made in a manner that allows a smooth transition within the market realities.\nBackground\nDairy is the most important sector of EU agriculture and present in all EU Member States. Dairy is produced in many different areas across the European Union, with a variety of animals - cows, sheep, goats or buffaloes — and shapes rural Europe. Milk and dairy products bring most relevant nutrition to all ages of the population and regular income to 300.000 employees in the dairy companies, and the connected 700.000 farmers producing the raw milk = see EDA Economic Report 2020. Dairy products are as natural as possible. Their processing methods have been handed down for generations and have been little modified apart of the technical progress in the equipment. However, the dairy industry can also prepare more elaborate specialties, such as a wide range of deserts and other special products for more defined needs, such as for adolescent, elderly and highly active people\nEuropean Dairy Association (EDA)\nwww.euromilk.org/e@eda\neda@euromilk.org\nAvenue d'Auderghem 22-28. 1040 Brussels.

It is also a keystone in keeping the cultural landscape.\nEarly on EDA put biodiversity at the forefront of relevant indications, making it an obligatory part of the Dairy PEF, the methodology driven by EDA for assessing the environmental footprint of dairy products considering a broad range of environmental criteria across their full life cycle. No harmonised assessment on biodiversity exists yet, but the Commission work in the PEF should also become the relevant method for the Biodiversity strategy in the Green Deal.\n\nPractices and commitments to protect biodiversity within the sector include for instance reducing ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching, increasing the amount of protein sourced from local land, sustainable soy sourcing as well as practices aimed at soil management and renewal at farm level (e.g. achieving a positive impact on soil, grassland and nature conservation).\nte Transtfion to a curcular economy\nA new Circular Economy Action Plan\nThe agricultural and food sector, more specifically the dairy, is at the origin of circular production cycles, and the tradition of circular production is the daily experience in the dairy sector.\n+ ~¥%\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\nThe sector is continuously working on improving its unique circularity and sustainability. An efficient use of resources is a main pillar of an efficient sector, and we are committed to enhance our vital role in ensuring sustainable production patterns.\nWe are active in a wide field of topics to improve our circular performance and we work with other sectors on issues such as packaging and recycling, as well as on by- products valorisation and water re-use — two areas where EDA would ask the EU legislators for opening where legal barriers persist.\nWith almost one-third of all food produced globally being lost or wasted between the field and the fork, we also seriously committed to reduce and prevent food waste along the value chain. Circularity is the core of our dairying since the start and we support further strive to close the circles in the wider world we have today.\nImprovements in water use efficiency and recycling measures have clearly decreased the aquatic impact of dairy. While there is still some way to go, recent developments have shown that the sector is on the right path.\nMoreover, further reducing losses of food is a continuous challenge that the dairy sector takes very seriously.\nIn this context, adequate packaging that safeguards the products from external influences plays a key role in avoiding food waste and ensuring safety and quality as a non-negotiable baseline. Nevertheless, the dairy sector is fully committed to reduce packaging waste along the chain and the environmental footprint of packaging is including in the assessment of the Dairy PEF.\nFurthermore, the EDA-IFCN study on the protein input to dairy cows via roughage shows that the European dairy sector sources the great majority of the protein (70%) from roughage which is almost entirely (95%) grown on farm. This represents a key factor when it comes to environmental and economic sustainability, as well as to circularity and efficient use of resources.\n\nThere are many examples of best practices and targets in dairies for reducing water consumption, for instance by improving water efficiency and increasing water reuse.\nActions and initiatives aimed at reducing food waste across the dairy supply chain are, for examples, targeted at reducing food waste through improving production efficiency, achieving zero waste for disposal in manufacturing sites, raising awareness at consumer level (e.g. making date labels better understandable), increasing food donation and increasing the use of previously discarded dairy by-products.\nWith regards to plastic packaging, companies are working with suppliers and engage in research to find new more sustainable materials and improve the design of dairy packaging. We can also find many targets in dairies for enhancing reusability, recyclability and composability of packaging.\nPOE are eS eta!\nwes ew hid\na en\na Be\nSe\noe \\\neee\n4\n*\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\n\\¥ A zero-pollution Europe\nstrategy on the sustainable use of\nchemicals\nThe dairy sector uses chemicals in the processing plants, as cleaning agents and disinfectants, that is to preserve food safety and quality. Similar uses also exist on farm level, and in transport of raw milk. Since a very long time the industry is used to control any possible residue of these uses along the whole production chain to assure safety of the final products.\nThe legislation on chemicals used for cleaning needs to remain adequate, to allow for realistic and reasonable use and storage of cleaning agents.\nAn improvement of the legislation of chemicals and residues would be highly appreciated for the agri-food sector where legal incongruity exists (e.g. between pesticides and biocides residues).\nWater is a very important factor for dairy; it is the main part of milk and it is essential in dairy processing in order to secure food safety via cleaning/rinsing. Water use and quality is part of the main indicators of the Dairy PEF methodology, assessing the overall environmental footprint of dairy products.\nClean Air and Water Action Plans\nRm od\nNe\ni\nthe\nbee\nhe:\n<o\nIn order to reduce the impact on water basins, significant efforts have been put to improve the quality of the water discharged from dairy installations.\n=\n4\nThe quality of air on farm and in production plants is also important contributions for assessing the overall environmental footprint of dairy products.\n\nBest practices in the dairy sector include, for instance, company-level commitments for enhancing the chemical status of wastewaters and national programmes aimed at improving water quality levels at rivers and lakes.\nconnect to the world of dairy\n+ ~¥%\neda’\neee\nstrategies of the Green Deal\nwv Farm to Fork\nFarm to Fork Strategy\nThe encompassing Farm to Fork strategy of the Commission is most welcome from the dairy industry. Already in 2015, our EDA president called for establishing a ‘Food Commissioner’ and according policy, to allow for an integrated and fully aligned approach on all parts of the agri-food sector's work and framework.\nOur commitment is to contribute to the achievement of a European sustainable food system, across the three qualitative pillars of sustainability, plus the economic one — that is social, nutrition, environment and economic (see Introduction and = Dairy sustainability synopsis). Therefore, we are committed to reduce our environmental footprint while continuing to provide nutritious, safe, and affordable products to the European and world citizens.\nThe Dairy PEF (product environmental footprint) is a fundamental tool for driving environmentally sustainable practices in the dairy sector and allowing to quantify the improvements. The project, conducted by EDA from 2014 to 2018 and officially approved by the EU Commission, members states and NGOs as the reference methodology in dairy, covers a broad list of environmental indicators and represents the holistic and proactive approach taken by the sector in the field of environmental assessment.\nJointly with other measures — e.g. nutritional content and consumer information - it is a helpful tool to describe all benefits of food and the effort of producing high quality food.\nIt is currently the best way to provide information on environmental indicators in a credible and measurable way, while being always further refined to integrate more indicators. It would be useful to make it the baseline for any relevant green claim in the EU, for communication to citizens and consumers.\nAny action decided would need to be science based, allow possible quantifiable results and coherent in the wider context of the complexity of food and drink production, to assure full credibility and real long-term solutions.\nFor a successful conversion of the system, the focus on main hotspots, genuine triggers and feasibility will allow the right stepwise approach, improving all indicators with time.\n——\n5\n*\n4\neda’\neee\nconnect to the world of dairy\nA broad variety of indicators exist to accomplish sustainable food systems, and dairy companies are focusing on major items in their remit, while assuring to also improve all other ones and avoiding any negative trade-offs on their path. For specific targets within the dairy sector on biodiversity protection, water and energy efficiency, food waste, packaging and GHG emissions reduction, please see the specific chapters of this paper.\nMany dairy companies have committed to eliminate deforestation in the supply chains. They include, for instance, targets on deforestation-free dairy value chains or covering all soy supply on responsibly sourced basis.\nAmong companies, there are also commitments for scaling up regenerative agriculture practices to protect soil health, enhance carbon sequestration, enhance the nutrient density of food while decreasing the reliance on synthetic inputs, as well as increasing the number of ingredients sourced from local production, in order to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.\nDairy companies provide a variety of dairy products for all ages and needs, for different taste and consumer preferences. Several companies and some national targets exist to reduce certain nutrients in certain categories, while others assure the know-how of regional qualities and most traditional recipes.\noO.\nCAP reform proposal\nA modernised and simplified CAP\nThe journey of the “European Green Deal” will absorb a lot of our energy in the coming years. The transformation of Europe to a carbon neutral continent, whilst also improving other environmental indicators, will ask an incredible effort from agriculture and dairy. We want to focus on this challenge.\nOn this journey, we will need the full support of the Common Agricultural Policy — “full support” translates in both, financial and political support (reference: EDA president at EDA2079.eu conference).\nEDA’s recommendations for the future CAP are designed to address the needs of all\nthree pillars of sustainability; the economic, social and environmental dimension. The proposed new set up of the CAP with its nine specific goals (including climate action, sustainable resource management and biodiversity) and its new delivery model based on national strategic plans is perfectly fit for uncorking the potential of the ‘green architecture’ of the CAP at production level.\nThis environmental ambition of the new CAP must also translate into a reinforcement of the chapters on sustainable development in trade agreements negotiated and concluded by the Union with third countries.\n*\n4\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\neeiewes | ransforming agriculture and rural areas\nVision for inclusive Rural Areas\nWith about 700,000 dairy farmers cooperating on a daily basis with their milk processors across Europe and more than 12,000 processing sites, mostly in the less densely industrialised areas, employing more than 300,000 Europeans, the dairy sector is the economic backbone of the rural areas in Europe.\nDairy provides employment and livelihoods to many people and contributes to Europe's (and wider) economic success. Dairy helps ensuring an inclusive, equitable quality education and lifelong learning.\nDespite the current urban growth, the sector contributes to the maintenance of safe, resilient and sustainable rural areas.\nFurthermore, dairy contributes significantly to the development of the youngest in societies.\nDairy farms have also an important role creating and maintaining a unique countryside scenery with a rich variety of landscapes and habitats that make rural areas attractive for the establishment of enterprises, places to live, and tourist and recreation businesses. Dairy animals are the principal contributors: they provide environmental, economic and patrimonial advantages to rural areas.\n£22) Achieving climate neutrality Revising 2030 climate targets\nEDA is proud to highlight the relevance of dairy in the wide context of environmental actions — including climate, but also looking to the broader picture with water and land uses, biodiversity and animal welfare.\nIt is important to make climate action happen, but we should not forget that the dairy industry is looking at the overal! environmental assessment from a more general point of view — to assure we do not improve on climate indicators while at the same time negatively impacting on other environmental components, e.g. water or land use. To do so, the dairy sector has developed the Dairy PEF (product environmental footprinting methodology), harmonising carbon/ climate assessment as well as 15 other environmental indicators.\n*\n4\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\n10\nThe European dairy sector has significantly reduced its greenhouse gas emissions in the past decades. The carbon footprint per produced unit of milk in Europe is already among the lowest in the world and the sector is fully committed to further decrease its carbon intensity and contribute to the achievement of the EU GHG emissions goals.\nWe are committed to contribute to achieving the 2030 revised emission goals and we hope that the effort will be adequately shared amongst sectors and put in relation to services provided.\n\nMany dairy companies have emissions reduction targets for 2030 or earlier covering emissions from dairy processing and from the upstream and downstream phases of the dairy chain.\nExtending ETS\nThe Dairy industry has made an important effort to seek relevant information about its ETS status and the carbon leakage risk to its powdered products. As long as the rest of the world does not endorse an own ETS systems, we need to maintain a carbon leakage status. Carbon leakage would mean a worsening of the global environmental condition, especially in view of the fact that the carbon footprint of European dairy is the lowest in the world.\nClimate Pact\n}\nThe dairy sector is ready to contribute to achieving the climate goals and hope the effort will be adequately shared amongst sectors, and put in relation to services provided (not forgetting the Paris agreement mention that food and nutrition security are of utmost importance and need special consideration)\nThe detailed requirements will be part of the 2030 climate targets (see above) and their probable 2050 extension; some dairy companies already have 2050 strategies at hand, and others will follow these innovation and investment needed.\nThe EU's implementation of the Paris Agreement must also be done in a balanced way that allows for production of highly nutritious dairy products in Europe, where the carbon footprint per produced unit of milk is among the lowest in the world.\nClimate Law\nThe European dairy sector plays a key role in making the food system more sustainable and is willing to further engage in order to reduce its environmental impact. In this context, EDA welcomes the EU Commission strategy aimed at achieving EU carbon-neutrality by 2050 and acknowledges its responsibility to contribute to the transition towards an\n*\n4\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\nll\nenvironmentally sustainable and climate-neutral Europe, while continuing to provide healthy and affordable nutrition for all.\nThe Dairy Product Environmental Footprint (Dairy PEF) has shown our proactive approach in increasing the sustainability of the food system and represents an essential tool for further decreasing the environmental impact of dairy operations, including the carbon footprint.\n\nEuropean dairies are frontrunners at global level when it comes to climate action. Many dairy industries have already signed up for the commitment of carbon neutral dairy chain by 2050 or even 2035, and we can already find examples of carbon-neutral certified companies in 2019.\nCaroon border tax\nEDA will be happy to see a carbon border tax assuring that the efforts of the EU producers are kept safe from unfair imports, and that will allow us to further improve our climate impact. We need to ensure that the European dairy remains competitive on the internal and external market across our journey towards carbon neutrality.\n-\na\n\"\n. «*a\"+ Clean, and reliable affordable energy\nReview Energy Legislation\nEuropean Framework for gas - Review Energy Taxation Oirective\nEnergy is important for the dairy sector, across all stages of production and processing. We also aim to be a net contributor to clean energy, via the production of biogas, energy from biomass, the reuse of heat and the production of renewable energy onsite using PV panels and wind turbines.\nWe believe it is important to support further efforts in the field of energy production and consumption to be fully credible in our overall sustainability approach.\n\nMany companies in dairy have committed to completely rely on renewable energy sources for electricity use in dairy operations. There are also targets for increasing the use of renewable energy in dairy farms.\n*\n4\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\n12\n‘2\nSustainable transport\nTransport is an important factor of dairy chain, as companies are the ones collecting the raw milk from the farms all over the countryside.\nWith regards to environmental impact, this is only minor for most dairy products (see Dairy PEF). Still, the dairy companies are willing to further engage in improving this part as well, with the right support.\n\nCommitments on reducing the environmental impact of transport in the dairy sector include the reduction of fuel consumption in the collection of raw milk.\n*\n4\neda’\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\n13\nFoundations of the Green Deal\nFinancing the transition\n@”\nEDA would be in favour of general measures to support more sustainable investment, green financing etc., to assure full credibility of our sustainability efforts in the dairy sector; details would need to be assessed.\nLeave no one behind\nGust Transition)\nAffordability of food and valuable nutrition for all is a main aim of the dairy sector, and we wish to continue contributing to simple, affordable and nutritious food for all in the future as well, especially for the weak parts of the population. Dairy products, as well es eggs, are already the most affordable sources of high value animal protein.\nDairy products are considered nutrient-rich foods, which means they provide many essential nutrients, but relatively few calories and at the same time at affordable prices. Milk, yoghurts and cheeses are all excellent sources of high-quality protein, as well of calcium, phosphorous, potassium, iodine, vitamin B2 and B12. Contrary to nutrient-poor foods (‘empty calories’), nutrient-rich foods such as dairy are vital for a balanced and healthy diet = more information in our EDA Factsheet.\ncoe\n*\neda’\nce\n4\nconnect to the world of dairy\neee\n14\nEDA relevant documents\nEDA Sustainability Statement on the European Dairy Sector & the SDGs Click here\nEDA Dairy Sustainability Synopsis Click here\nEDA Factsheet on Feeding the World with Dairy Click here\nEDA Factsheet on the Dairy PEF Project Click here\nEDA Dairy Factsheet on Dairy contribution to social sustainability Click here\nEDA Sustainability Factsheet: Dairy important actor for climate and the environment Click here\nEDA Factsheet: Preventing food wastage in the dairy sector Click here\nEDA position on the reduction of certain plastic products on the environment Click here\nEDA Sustainability Statement on circular economy Click here\nEDA Factsheet: what can you produce with raw milk?

As a minimum, current level of support must be guaranteed for the upcoming EU ETS phase 2021-2030. These measures have been recognized by the Commission to be effective in sustaining industrial competitiveness and they are compatible with international frameworks. 2) Existing carbon leakage instruments should be complemented with a European industrial electricity price, alleviating the energy cost pressure.

It is thus of major importance that prior to any decision, the Commission conducts thorough impact assessments to substantiate its claims and provide sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of such measures.\nStrengthen existing instruments of carbon leakage protection\nThe European Commission is currently considering the possibility of introducing a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism to address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU. As many international partners do not share the same climate ambition as the EU, the Commission argues that such a mechanism, if designed in a compatible way with international agreements, could prevent production and investment leakage from Europe and ultimately also contribute to a global reduction of emissions.\nAs a leading European chemical company active in the silicone, polymer, life sciences and polysilicon markets, WACKER welcomes the commitment by the Commission to reinforce the tools to tackle carbon leakage, most recently reassured in the EU industrial strategy.' In 2019, the annual emissions of WACKER regulated under the ETS amounted to approximately one million tons, combined with an electricity consumption of approximately 4.8 TWh for its European based production. Free allocation and indirect cost compensation therefore constitute essential preconditions for WACKER to both contribute to the EU’s climate targets and maintain competitiveness on global markets, where producers don’t face the same cost of carbon.\nIt remains essential for the European energy-intensive industry that the existing instruments are not scaled-back, as contradictorily observed in the Commission’s draft for EU ETS Guidelines on indirect compensation. Rather, as these measures have proven to be effective and compatible with international trade when applied behind borders, the level of support must be guaranteed — and ideally — increased over the next EU ETS phase (2021-2030).\n1 A industrial strategy for Europe, COM(2020) 102 final, 8: “Should differences in ambition around the new p. world persist, the Commission will propose a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in 2021 (...). This should be Supported by strengthening our current tools to tackle carbon leakage.”\nIndustrial electricity pricing — reinforcing Europe’s indirect carbon leakage protection\nLooking towards 2030, the established instruments will however not be sufficient to effectively protect European industry against carbon leakage. Producers in Europe will likely be facing tougher reduction rates under the ETS, as the Commission is planning to increase the 2030 climate target to 50-55%. At the same time, key global competitors will continue to benefit from structural advantages (e.g. subsidized credit or electricity prices), increasing the competitiveness gap between European and global industrial ecosystems.\nThe situation is particularly worrying for Europe’s energy-intensive production. In the case of polysilicon, WACKER faces electricity costs 2-3 higher than in comparison to its key competitors in Western China. Besides regulated electricity prices, Chinese producers also benefit from other subsidies, such as cheap financing and land use rights. As a result, Chinese producers have been developing a dominating role along the entire value chain of photovoltaic panels over the last few years (Figure 1).\nA similar development is to be expected for the semiconductor value chain. While Europe still shows a diverse and competitive industrial ecosystem for semi-conductors, Chinese players are likely to expand more intensively into the sector due to the strategic importance for the downstream electronics sector (Figure 2). Inevitably, also for European producers the first negative economic impacts have materialized: In February 2020, WACKER announced to launch an efficiency program to secure its competitiveness in the harsh global environment. These measures, aiming at saving €250 million a year, will foremostly target European production sites and foresee a loss of approximately 1000 European jobs by 2022.2\nFigure 1: Leading producers worldwide in the solar value chain\n2019\nTe\n5%\nwl\never LS\n> *\ndt / ay,\na*\n>\nae\nCell\nModule\nSystem\nERE WACKER\n| Longi\nBM Longi\ni Longi\nWl GcL\nGCL\nWi Tongwei i Canadian Solar\nal East Hope\npal JA Solar\nWM ASolar Hi JASolar\nWB Yonoxian\ngal Jinko\nWB Jinko\nMM TBEA\nal Rietech/Rende ell] Trina\n:\nga Trina\naa Daqo\nWB Zhonghuan\nMMM Shunfeng [Mj Risen\n2020 a ~~)\n%@; Hanwha <@; Hanwha\nSource: WACKER Polysilicon\nChinese dominance in the solar value chain has expanded rapidly in the last years and is putting European and other global producers in an unprecedentedly challenging market situation.

The model could be based on Contracts for Difference (CfD), guaranteeing a competitive price of electricity for European energy-intensive producers. While the mechanism could be implemented and financed on the national level, the actual price level would be coupled and adapted on a regular basis to the respective price level developments of key global competitors. As already the case in France’, national arrangements on industrial electricity prices need to be rendered compatible under the EU state aid guidelines. Additionally, if combined with mandatory Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between renewable energy producers and industrial customers, an industrial electricity price could effectively contribute to decarbonizing energy-intensive industry and enable a market-based integration of solar and wind energy. Furthermore, as it would be applied behind the European border, it should have a lower risk of conflict with existing international trade frameworks.\nFunctionality and compatibility of CBA measures remain highly uncertain\nWACKER shares many of the concerns voiced by other industrial stakeholders regarding the complexity and uncertainty of implementing a CBA mechanism in order to strengthen carbon leakage protection in Europe. It is thus of major importance that prior to any decision, the Commission conducts thorough impact assessments to substantiate its claims and to provide evidence for their effectiveness.\n3 Sources: Sources: Electronics (IC Insights), Semiconductors (WSTS, only silicon-based), sources: Silicon wafers (SEMI SMG), Electronic applications (estimate), WACKER; IPCEI on Microelectronics 2018: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/de/IP_18 6862 ; https://ipcei-me.eu/ . 4 In France, the ARENH (= l’'accés régulé a I’électricité nucléaire historique) mechanisms allows “new” electricity suppliers to purchase an annual electricity volume of 100 TWh at a price level that reflects historical generation costs of nuclear energy (~42/MWh). Several energy-intensive companies qualify as authorized electricity suppliers and thus profit from the purchase of cheap electricity for their industrial production. The scheme has been rendered compatible with EU state aid rules.\nae”\nWith regards to the policy options outlined in the Commission’s inception impact assessment, the following aspects need to be critically assessed from the point of view of energy-intensive industry:\nEffectiveness of policy instrument\n- Due to the uncertainty around the legal and technical feasibility of CBA measures and the practical difficulties of implementation, the maturity of these measures must be reviewed critically in their function of providing an adequate and stable level of carbon leakage protection for energy-intensive industry. Applied at the border for products entering the European market, CBA measures could be rendered incompatible with the framework of the World Trade Organization. Besides raising legal uncertainty, such measures could seriously increase the risk for retaliation measures and destabilize multilateral trading relations, which would in return harm European exporting industry. Concerns around the effectiveness of CBA mechanisms also relate to their core ability to reduce global emissions while safeguarding European competitiveness and need to be further examined.\nMethodological approach\n- The methodological considerations of designing CBA measures based on a similar benchmark system found in the EU ETS must be considered as highly uncertain in practice, as there is currently no global system in place that accounts for the carbon content of products. Finding a workable solution on how to address this lack of robust and transparent data thus remains a major obstacle for implementation in a non- discriminatory and compliant way under international frameworks. Assuming the lack of data can be addressed, CBA measures would require a vastly complex system to reflect the international interconnections within the value chains of the target products, including changes or ranges, when producers use multiple global suppliers.\nSectoral scope\n- The EU already provides effective measures to prevent carbon leakage for sectors covered by the ETS. It is therefore questionable to what extent CBA measures would provide an added value for energy-intensive industries that otherwise couldn’t be achieved by strengthening free allocation and indirect cost compensation. Bearing this in mind, it is necessary that the Commission takes a differentiated approach when assessing the suitability of the sectors already covered by existing measures. Depending on sectoral structure and exporting practices, the Commission must consider the different needs of carbon leakage protection during the fourth trading phase of the EU ETS and adopt tailor-made approaches accordingly.\nFor further information, please contact: Sanni Kunnas (sanni.kunnas@wacker.com)"

The company is a leading European manufacturer of hot rolled steel products and the largest manufacturer of steel plates in the Czech Republic.\nWith regards to the main objective, we support the Commission's endeavour in instituting a carbon border adjustment measure to \"[fight] climate change by avoiding carbon leakage\". As the fight against climate change needs to be global, the measure can be an opportunity for the EU to project its climate leadership globally. It is equally important to consider the EU's existing internal climate targets (by 2030, and climate neutrality potentially by 2050). When designing the measure, it is therefore important to consider the impacts of the measure on both these EU internal targets (greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy production), and global CO2 reduction ambitions, and \"to prevent environmental harm\" as stated in the inception report.\nRegardless of the policy instruments suggested by the Commission in the report (i.e. a carbon tax on selected products — both on imported and domestic products; a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports; the extension of the EU ETS to imports), what is paramount is that the measure should enable a level playing field in which the ‘polluter pays' — a cornerstone of EU environmental policy enshrined in Art 191 TFEU.\nFor the steel sector in particular, the final measure then needs to do two things: 1 The scope of the measure needs to cover the full steel value chain 2. The measure needs to enable an individual exporter adjustment\nWith regards to the first point, the scope of the measure needs to include the full steel value chain, from finished products to upstream raw materials. Both direct and indirect CO2 emissions also need to be included to prevent further carbon leakage, even when the indirect segment is not yet subject to EU ETS.\nAccording to the UN's 2019 Global Resources Outlook, resource extraction and processing account for half of the world's carbon emissions.' In addition, according to the OECD, raw materials use is expected to double by 2060.? Failing to include the entire value chain would lead to a potential increase in imports of carbon-intensive non-taxed products like coke, pig iron, directly reduced iron (DRI) or other products, and could increase rather than reduce carbon leakage. Choosing to cover one part of the value chain but not others would also disrupt the level playing field within the EU industry: segments of the industry would be advantaged over the other which is not acceptable from a policy perspective (technology/product neutrality).\n1 Euractiv (2019), 'Resource extraction responsible for half world’s carbon emissions’,\nhttps www.euractiv.com/section/circular-economy/news/resource-extraction-responsible-for-half-worlds-\ncarbon-emissions/\n? OECD (2018), 'Raw materials to double by 2060 with environmental consequences’, use severe https www.oecd.org/environment/raw-materials-use-to-double-by-2060-with-severe-environmental- consequences.htm\nOn the second point, adherent to the ‘polluter pays' principle, it is critical that 'cleaner' third- country producers importing steel into the EU should be taxed less, and / or third-country producers with a COz footprint lower than the EU benchmark (however it is calculated) should be exempted. For example, a third-country integrated steel producer performing better than an average EU integrated producer should be taxed less or exempted when they import into the EU.\nThe ‘polluter pays' principle could also be used to adjust the mechanism to incentivise producers whose CO: footprint is better than that of the average EU producer, setting a clear stimulus for decarbonisation. This setup would not only contribute to negative carbon leakage (reducing emissions elsewhere), but also ensure that the EU preserves its capacity to achieve its internal climate targets, by stimulating a material import flow of cleaner materials from third regions.\nWithout an individual adjustment, a 'one-size-fits-all' mechanism applied to third-country producers exporting to the EU, would be discriminatory towards ‘cleaner’ third-country producers who have already invested in lowering emissions, and would not lead to better global CO2 mitigating outcomes. On the contrary, a flat tax for example without an individual adjustment would benefit importers with the lowest costs, including lower investments in COz reductions. Moreover, such a mechanism could result in substitution of more expensive ‘cleaner’ steel (their price already including abatement costs) with cheaper products manufactured by companies with less ambitious decarbonisation efforts. To keep their market share and remain price-competitive, cleaner producers would be forced to reduce their R&D and/or stop investing in decarbonisation efforts, slowing down global COz2 mitigation progress.\nThe measure outlined in the above requires establishing a universal standardised CO2 certification methodology and an independent universal verification system to allow for an individual company to prove they are eligible for the tax reduction or exemption. We believe it should be modelled after the EU ETS and therefore be producer-based. The burden of proof would be on the producer, and ideally it should be an automatic ex-ante system to prevent the need for a complex administration, avoiding barriers to trade.\nAbout VITKOVICE STEEL, a.s.\nThe company’s main production program includes heavy plates and shaped cut outs, which are produced in the sheet metal rolling mill, and sheet piles, which are produced in the heavy section rolling mill.\nThe company is the only manufacturer of sheet piles in the Czech Republic and one of only two manufacturers in the European Union.

The European plastics industry makes a significant contribution to the welfare in Europe by enabling innovation, creating quality of life to citizens and facilitating resource efficiency and climate protection. More than 1.6 million people are working in EU converting companies (mainly SMEs) to create a turnover in excess of € 260 billion per year. \nSince its creation, EuPC has always been a great supporter of the EU initiatives for the industry and for the protection of the environment, those that reflect a true European vision. \n\nREASONING \n\nEuropean Plastics Converters welcome the initiative of the European Commission to ensure a level playing field between European and non-European companies. Europe’s efforts to go climate-neutral by 2050 cannot be undermined by lack of ambition by other companies and countries around the world, especially looking at the International agreements we are bound and the need to truly protect our Environment. \nHence, a new carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism that can impose direct and indirect carbon cost to importers similar to the cost already charged to European manufacturers would restore a level playing field on the European market. This will in turn create an incentive for importers to adopt climate policies in their own countries and allow the carbon content of products to be better reflected for the final customer, providing a more efficient and powerful signal for consumption and behavioural changes.\nFor the European plastics industry, this is particularly relevant because the high quality of production, safety requirements (for workers, for the environment, for users…) and sophistication of production render it quite costly, especially when compared with competitors based in neighbouring or Asian countries. Reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement will involve further investment and performance improvement that would make plastic manufacturing increasingly expensive in Europe. If this virtuosity is thwarted by imported raw materials and finished products with no carbon emissions’ compensation mechanism, this will nullify by default all European efforts. \nAs said, the need to apply a level playing field and use a CBA, as proposed by the European Commission, is necessary for both raw materials as well as semi-finished and finished products. Otherwise, we wonder how a European company can compete in the global arena without having a legal protection from unfair and polluting counterparties.\n \nFINAL COMMENT \n\nIn the light of the above exposed arguments, EuPC believes that a CBA mechanism must be applied to ensure there is no carbon leakage and to integrate the existing trade defence tools the EU has in place. Europe is ambitious in its green activities and, thanks to the Climate Deal and related Communications, is setting a higher benchmark for all European and non-European industries. \n",

But we want to raise the following concerns:\n\n1.\tIt is essential to design any CBAM to be WTO compatible and to discuss with our trade partners to avoid any retaliation measures (which could affect products not covered by the CBAM).\n2.\tIt is also crucial to give industry a medium/long term vision. The ETS revision had the merit to give industry some certainty until 2030 (carbon leakage list, level of free allocation,…). The system should not be changed in a few years’ time to propose a completely different mechanisms. This 10 years visibility period is important to maintain the current levels of investment and to attract new ones.\n3.\tEach sector is different and any impact assessment should be carried out at an appropriate NACE or even PRODCOM level, in agreement with the different sectors. CBAM should not be the only option to be assessed as consumption charges might work better for some sectors.\n4.\tCBAM will only protect EU companies selling their products in the EU. Net exporters will face a major disadvantage and should be compensated.\n5.\tThe possible impacts on the whole value chain of a sector should be analysed. If a CBAM is only designed for basic materials, it could become less expensive to buy a complex product directly from outside the EU rather than producing it in the EU from the basic materials.\n6.\tA transition period will be necessary where CBAM and free allocation still co-exist in order to allow the sectors to adapt.\n7.\tThe carbon intensity benchmarks defining the level of the CBAM should be set at a high level to encourage non-EU companies to provide their own carbon footprint data. Monitoring and verification of these data will be crucial provide trust and to allow the CBAM to work adequately.\n8.\tThe funds raised with the CBAM should be reinjected in the EU economy, with a priority for low CO2 projects in industry.\n\n\nOoO\n\nFEVE is the Federation of European manufacturers of glass containers. It is listed in the EU Transparency Register with number 1550133398-72.\nFounded in 1977 and headquartered in Brussels, FEVE is an international not-for-profit association. Its members produce over 20 million tonnes of glass per year. The association has some 60 corporate members belonging to approximately 20 independent corporate groups. 160 manufacturing plants are located across 23 European States and include global blue chip and major companies working for the world’s biggest consumer brands.\nThe European container glass industry provides a wide range of glass packaging products for food and beverages as well flacons for perfumery, cosmetics and pharmacy to their European and world customers. With its 162 manufacturing plants distributed all over Europe, it is an important contributor to Europe’s real economy and provides employment to about 50,000 people, while creating a large number of job opportunities along the total supply chain.\n",

        "pdf_text": "Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nThe Federation of Austrian Industries’ contribution to the European Commission’s Inception Impact Assessment on CBAMs\nThe Federation of Austrian Industries (Industriellenvereinigung, IV) is the voluntary and independent representation of interests of the Austrian industry and its related sectors. It represents more than 4.500 members in the manufacturing sector, credit and insurance sector, infrastructure and industry-oriented services in Austria and Europe. In Austria, the Federation’s members represent more than 80 per cent of domestic manufacturing companies. IV acts as the interface between business, politics and the wider public. On European level, the Federation of Austrian Industries is a member of BusinessEurope.\nIn December 2019, the European Commission published a Communication on the European Green Deal, in which it announced several initiatives including a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism.\nGeneral remarks\nThe Federation of Austrian Industries acknowledges the political relevance of such a mechanism as well as the European Commission’s intention to prevent that less- ambitious international partners undermine the EU’s climate ambition. Given the fact that the EU only accounts for 10% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential for the EU to complement its already ambitious climate targets with measures that create a global level-playing field for its companies, especially when they are interacting with Europe’s main trading partners.\nDesigning a CBA mechanism will be politically challenging. The process needs to be systematic, well-thought through, and possible consequences need to be assessed, analysed and if deemed negative, mitigated thoroughly. It is pivotal to incorporate the following guiding principles into a possible CBA mechanism’s design:\n1. A possible CBA mechanism must not substitute current carbon leakage measures! Such an approach is highly problematic and could jeopardise the tool’s legality as well as its effectiveness.\ne The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is and should remain the key market- based instrument allowing the European industry and power sectors to economically reduce their GHG emissions. This includes current carbon leakage measures comprising compensation for direct and indirect! CO2-costs. Under the EU ETS, the system of free allowances provides the key stimulus for the best and most efficient industrial installations. Replacing the existing carbon leakage measures by an untested mechanism would create considerable uncertainties and risks for European industry. Additionally, by substituting free allowances, European companies’ competitiveness on export / third markets is jeopardised. A CBA mechanism only encourages foreign companies to produce more environmentally friendly, if they want to enter the EU market. This effect, however, is not achieved on third markets / European export markets without carbon pricing. By continuing to grant free allowances to EU companies under the ETS, they are also able to assert competitive pressure on foreign producers on third markets. This guarantees to exert pressure on foreign installations to produce more environmentally / climate friendly. Hence, deleting or phasing out free allowances and indirect cost compensations should be avoided at any cost. This would even have the opposite effect to a CBA mechanism’s purpose to create a level-playing field for Europe. Conversely, having a CBA mechanism set up in parallel to free allowances and indirect cost compensation allows for testing it at relatively low\n1 in some Member States\n1/4\nlevels and impacts. There would be no double protection for industry, as the CBA mechanism would only align CO2-related costs between non-EU and EU installations. It is therefore very worrying that the Green Deal Communication published on 11 December 2019 as well as the Commission’s Inception Impact Assessment state that the CBA mechanism “would be an alternative to the measures that address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU’s Emissions Trading System”.? This would entail an immediate shift to a system of full auctioning, in which costs, impact and commercial risks could become very burdensome.\n2. A possible CBA mechanism must be in accordance with World Trade Organisation rules and other international obligations of the EU (e.g. United Nations).\ne WTO compatibility avoids dispute procedures, improves regulatory predictability and prevents retaliatory counter-measures, which could only be justified in case the CBA mechanism is not in accordance with the WTO rulebook. e A possible CBA mechanism should be based on the grounds of environmental protection (Art XX GATT (lit b + lit g)) in order to be WTO-compliant. Industrial relocalisation — carbon and investment leakage — would not only have a severe impact on prosperity and jobs in Europe, but would also have negative effects on the overall climate and environment, if production is shifted into world regions with less ambitious climate and environmental standards. The Austrian Institute for Industrial Ecology calculated that one ton of reduced CO2 emissions in Austria due to relocalisation/offshoring leads to additional CO2 emissions of 1.9 tons abroad. Other grounds of justification than environmental protection could face difficulties under WTO-rules (according to Article | GATT — Most Favoured Nation). e A (European) CBA mechanism must not set a precedent for further restrictions on trade in the future based on other, non-environmental/climate-related matters. It will already be extremely challenging to reliably measure the carbon content of traded materials, especially if life-cycle CO2 emissions are considered. A CBA mechanism should only be introduced as a temporary measure until an efficient, fair, global CO2-pricing system is in place. The European Union should continue to work towards such a system on international level.\n3. The EU’s supply with critical raw materials and semi-finished products must be guaranteed.\ne A potential CBA mechanism must not reduce the availability or increase the price of critical raw materials not sufficiently sourced within the European Union for the European manufacturing sector and industry. Equally, the cost for intermediate and semi-finished products essential for European production must not be increased.\nQuestions raised in the EC’s Inception Impact Assessment:\nQ1 EC Inception Impact Assessment: Type of policy instrument\ne A potential CBA mechanism should be built on an extended import-ETS model. The models price should be aligned with the ETS market price and with ETS benchmarks. Thus, the “import price” would be equivalent to the cost European companies are facing, which would increase the chances for WTO compatibility. The obligation to pay should lie with the producer based outside the European Union. The producer is obliged to report any CO2-related cost related to the production.\n2 Page 5 of European Commission, COM (2019) 640 final\n2/4\nQ2 EC Inception Impact Assessment: Methodological approach\ne A CBA mechanism should be based on EU ETS benchmark values for industrial processes, unless the importer certifies lower carbon content or higher CO2-related costs at origin. EU-internal carbon leakage measures can co-exist with a CBA mechanism as free allowances are only partially contributing to achieving the benchmarks In addition, they are already being decreased by a higher factor of 2.2% between 2021 and 2030. A CBA mechanism must cover the full value chain. If a European producer sources intermediate or semi-finished products from abroad to produce a final product in Europe, this producer must not face higher CO2-related initial costs than a competitor outside the EU. In the US, similar debates exist (Liebermann, Warner (America's Climate Security Act 2007, introduced in October 2017); Bingman, Specter (Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007, introduced November 2007)). The Lieberman/Warner bill introduces “international reserve allowances” that need to be bought by importers from countries without a comparable GHG-emission mitigation system in place. The price for an allowance is sector-specific and based on the national energy intensity of production minus any free allowances granted to the domestic sector. t is paramount that a CBA mechanism is transparent, universal, easy to implement, objective and as unbureaucratic as possible. Proper registration, verification and anti-fraud measures need to be implemented and supervised by an independent authority. On the other hand, obligatory EU-monitoring and on-site controls seem unnecessary. A CBA mechanism should be started with a testing phase of at least one year, during which CBA mechanism certificates/allocations/allowances are granted for free. If a potential CBA mechanism is introduced, it is to be reviewed constantly, analysing its effectiveness regarding climate/environmental protection and its impact on European competitiveness.\nQ3 EC Inception Impact Assessment: Sectoral scope\ne A potential CBA mechanism should only be started with selected (sub-)sectors to address uncertainty and explore possible legal challenges or retaliatory measures. If more sectors are added gradually, qualitative assessments must be a prerequisite to capture sector-specific issues and needs. Such a sectoral approach is also important to respect “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities” under the Paris Agreement. e In particular (sub-)sectors should be included that (alternatively): © are particularly exposed to international competition [e) produce globally standardised products [e) represent a significant share of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions\nOpen questions\nIn addition to the points mentioned above, further questions need to be discussed, including but not limited to the following:\nQ1. How would necessary carbon data for a CBA mechanism be collected and verified it in a reliable and transparent way?\nCollecting and disclosing carbon content data and CO2-related costs would be decisive for successful CBA mechanism measures. The common Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system for emissions as foreseen in the Paris Agreement must be developed further. How can this process be facilitated? Can plurilateral solutions lead to progress in this area?\n3/4\nQ2: How could the revenues generated with the CBA be used most effectively?\nThe impact assessment should look into how the CBA mechanism’s revenues can be used to achieve its goals. For example, should the revenues flow into the EU ETS Innovation Fund or another fund to help bring the costs down for EU-based low-carbon RDI, or should it be used to fund low-carbon investments in third countries?\nQ3: How to measure additionality of the CBA?\nIn a hypothetical situation, producers in third countries could reorganise their trade flows to export only their cleanest products/products produced in their most efficient installations to Europe, thereby minimising any CBA mechanism price, whereas dirty products/products produced in old/high-emitting installations are sold domestically or in other parts of the world without adequate carbon pricing. A CBA mechanism’s effect to push other major economies to increase their climate actions might be significantly diminished. This would also put European producers exporting to other parts of the world at a significant cost disadvantage.\nQ4: How does the Commission take the impact on the whole value chain into account?\nThe Federation of Austrian Industries stands ready to provide further input on the Commission’s plans and will continue to provide feedback as these plans develop.\n4/4"

        "feedback": "The Climate Law includes the goal of climate neutrality for the EU by 2050. Reaching this target is likely to involve a significant increase in carbon prices. To avoid a loss of competitiveness for EU industries and higher CO2 emissions in other regions, we support the principle of protecting efficient european industries exposed to unfair international competition through a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nIf we are fully convinced by the final objective of being carbon neutral in 2050, achieving this objective does not seem however in good way without stepping-up ambitions and support of the European Commission on all low carbon solutions. An energy mix based on all low carbon energies must be supported or at least not hampered when they already contribute to CO2 emissions reduction so that energy policy and climate action can go hand in hand. \nThe level of the carbon price signal at European level must therefore be ambitious enough to achieve the objectives of reducing CO2 emissions at lower cost. Thus we support reinforcement and extension of ETS system and carbon taxation insofar as it is socially just, that’s to say accompanied by redistribution measures. The revenues from ETS and from energy taxation should mainly be channeled to help people and workers most impacted in the energy transition. It should  be clarified how the costs of the transformation will be shared across society and throughout the industrial value.\nWe deeply promote a just transition to protect jobs, competitiveness, industry and investments in Europe by avoiding carbon leaks. A fair global level playing field must be guaranteed by avoiding carbon leakage and by precluding carbon dumping. All regions of the world should carry their fair share in the additional costs of the transition.  As Europe represents only 10 % of global emissions, it is key that other parts of the world develop the same level of ambition and carry their fair share in the global effort to combat emissions.\nThe CBAM must be set-up to ensure a fair competition from foreign industries. These measures will also incentivize investments in low carbon policies in other countries as well in the the EEA countries and favor innovation everywhere. We are of course aware of risks and legal issues regarding trade agreements, WTO regulations and possible retaliation actions and we think that this must be fully integrated to define the best mechanism that will protect our industry and jobs. This objective can be reached by addressing carbon pricing differences in free trade agreements, by closing the borders for products produced without respecting international environmental agreements or labour standards. New financial products (e.g. green as well carbon-free bonds) that promote long-term sustainable investments can also be developed while short-termism on the financial markets should be discouraged. \nEuropean industries need fair access to international markets as well as to benefit from a real european industrial strategy. While promoting common values in Europe we must do the same internationally. When negotiating and signing trade agreements, the EU must impose compliance from the partners with Fundamental Labour Standards as well as with the Paris agreement to mitigate Climate change. Trade agreements should contain an enforceable chapter on labour rights. They should also contain an enforceable chapter about fighting climate change within the framework of the Paris 2015th agreement to ensure a level playing field safeguarding our energy intensive industries.\nIn conclusion, massive investments will be needed in the industry sector to undertake appropriate restructuring of value chains and decarbonize their processes. EU should  focus on implementing a large panel of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in Europe. Support for research and innovation will be crucial in establishing a true EU leadership and a climate-driven industrial policy.\n",

VDB as representative of the biofuel producers in Germany\nThe Association of the German Biofuel Industry (Verband der Deutschen Bio- kraftstoffindustrie e. V. - VDB) represents the interests of 15 biofuel producers in Germany with a production capacity of 2.3 million tons of biodiesel (and 600 GWh of biomethane). This equals approximately 60% of the total biodiesel ca- pacity in Germany in the transport sector.\n2. Remarks on the initiative\nThe Paris Agreement has strengthened international climate cooperation by fostering a bottom-up process: Within this framework, countries and regions contribute to the common global goal of holding the increase in the global aver- age temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C.\nHowever, such an approach may be undermined by carbon leakage, i.e. the dis- placement of emissions from states with more to less stringent climate policy constraints. Regarding the European Union, the establishment of border carbon adjustments (BCAs) offers a promising response. BCAs represent a functional policy option to alleviate the risk of carbon leakage, which can occur whenever only a subset of jurisdictions implements serious climate action. Carbon leakage matters, because it threatens to hurt the economy of countries with ambitious climate legislation and at the same time could undermine aggregate emission reductions and the effectiveness of collective climate action. BCAs can help sus- tain and increase domestic climate protection ambition while also incentivizing foreign countries to take comparable action, and thereby supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement. BCAs can be an effective instrument to level the playing field among competing producers.\nIn this respect, it seems necessary to design and introduce BCAs in an inclusive and transparent way from the outset.\nwww.biokraftstoffverband.de\nAssociation of the German Biofuel Industry\nVerband der Deutschen Biokraftstoffindustrie e.V.\nTel. +49 (0)30—72 625911 Fax +49 (0)30 —- 72 6259 19 info@biokraftstoffverband.de\nAm Weidendamm 1A\n10117 Berlin\nPresident\nStefan Schreiber\nManaging Director\nElmar Baumann\nSince a Europe-wide CO2 pricing system currently only exists within the framework of the EU ETS which does not include ESR sectors such as transport or agriculture, the question arises how these sectors are to be dealt with in the future and if BCAs here are also already being planned.\nFrom our point of view, several key issues need to be clarified in the further consultation process of the European Commission, including\nwhich economic sectors and which products within individual sectors the Carbon Border Adjust- ment Mechanism should cover; which interactions with existing and announced CO2-pricing mechanisms in the EU or in member states have to be considered; whether and how compatibility with the WTO law is to be achieved; what the concrete regulatory design might look like.\nFurthermore, available data on carbon border adjustment mechanisms already in place in between the United States and Canada should be collected and used for the evaluation of the efficacy of the mechanism."

The attribution of an appropriate cost per tonne of CO) emitted and its valorisation within the VAT. This mechanism would entail a VAT increase on high emission products (for the moment coming from non-EU production characterized by an intense use of energy produced from coal). At the same time, this application will give a similar relief for those productions with low carbon content, such as European ones, which thanks to EU’s emission policies excel in terms of sustainability at world level.\nIt should be emphasized, that this proposal the “Charge on Added Emissions” puts the European consumer right at the centre of the process and makes him aware, through the evidence of the modulation of VAT based on emissions released during the production phase of the sustainability of the goods he is buying.\n1 Resolution of joint Committees X e XIII (Industry and Environment), approved at the conclusion of the examination of the deal assigned on competitive asymmetries for European industry deriving from low energy costs and low environmental standards in non-EU countries, 1 August 2017.

The import of 20 million bicycles and e-bikes, which is the annual EU demand, from China would result in over 2 Million tons of extra emissions globally.\n\nAs proven in the study of the Milan Politecnic, these additional emissions would result from:\n•\t50% by the difference in the manufacturing carbon footprint in China which still relies heavily on coal (for instance, aluminium production in China relies on coal up to 80%, while EU\naluminium production uses only 5% coal).\n•\tthe other 50% because of transport emissions: containerships still use heavily polluting sludge oil which causes lethal emissions of sulphur dioxide, and over 60% of containers go back to China empty because of the trade imbalance between the EU and China.\n\nMoreover, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the shift to renewable energy is a major goal for the EU, as stated in guidelines such as the “European Green Deal” (European Commission, 2019), the “2020 climate and energy package” (European Commission, 2008), the “Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050” (European Commission, 2011) and the “2030 framework for climate and energy policies” (European Commission, 2014).\n\nChina is by far the biggest polluter in the world and will continue using more and more coal-based energy until 2050 thanks to its unjust status as a developing country (rather than industrialized country) confirmed in the Paris Agreement COP 21. You can also see the pollution radar here: https://earth.nullschool.net/cs/#current/chem/surface/level/overlay=cosc/orthographic=120.92,24.23,450/loc=114.120,24.762\n\nFurther, regarding circular economy, the EU bicycle, e-bike and components industry has already started investments now with the EU aluminium industry to adapt secondary alloys for cycle components in the near future. This would improve further and significantly the carbon footprint of EU-manufactured bicycles, e-bikes and components.\n\nMoreover, EU pedal assist e-bike producers have for many years been in the lead worldwide in the promotion of the recycling of old batteries. In addition, EU tire producers are already adopting green compounds made largely from recycled and renewable rubber.",

If policies implemented in Europe lead to carbon leakage rather than innovation, the competitiveness of European industry is hurt without reducing global CO2 emissions. Acarbon border adjustment mechanism, nevertheless, poses great risks for the European automotive industry that needs to be considered.\nEurope’s automotive supply industry is concerned about:\ne Technical complexities and administrative burden: a carbon border adjustment mechanism could result in a technically highly complex measure adding a significant administrative burden and lowering the competitiveness of our industry; the global automotive supply chain is highly complex, with a high degree of cross-border labour division, increasing the complexity of calculating the carbon intensity of specific automotive parts. Protectionism and additional burdens to trade: a carbon border adjustment mechanism may raise questions regarding WTO compliance, trigger retaliation by third countries, and may induce other governments to misuse environmental policy as an excuse to justify protectionist measures hurting global trade. Even if the Commission might find a way to implement a de jure WTO compliant measure, international partners might very will interpret the initiative as protectionist and retaliate. At least 17% of European jobs in the automotive industry depend on extra-EU exports, highlighting the risk that protectionist measures by third countries could represent for European employment. Costs ofinput resources: certain materials used inthe automotive industry (such as a wide range of types of hot-dip galvanised steel) cannot always be provided in the quantities or qualities required by European industries. A carbon border adjustment mechanism may increase the costs of these resources without protecting European resource industries and therefore needlessly hamper the competitiveness of the European automotive supply industry.\nThese three concerns would apply to all three proposed forms of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (a carbon tax, a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports, or the extension of the EU ETS to imports).\nCLEPA would strongly recommend the Commission to take into account industry concerns and, if a carbon adjustment mechanism would be needed at all, to ensure WTO compliance, avoid any suspicion of protectionist reasoning behind the mechanism, and choose for a very incremental implementation process."

We therefore appreciate the opportunity to share some of our thoughts that the implementation of such a policy option, beyond all legal, technical and political challenges, might bring along.\nWith the final design of the instrument to be elaborated, AVE welcomes the progress to focus on carbon- and energy-intensive industries and sectors in the first stage of introducing such a mechanism. This will enable the EC to test feasibility and appropriateness of this targeted method to reach its goals of reducing emissions and possible carbon leakage, to check its superiority in comparison to other policy instruments as well as its compliance with WTO- Regulations. Having a transparent calculation template in place in due course will also allow to apply this methodology to more complex sectors and products, as to be found in particular in the FMCG-Sector, and to enable respective importers such as German Retailers to assess any effects along their entire supply chain in a timely manner. This approach is to avoid that consumer goods, amongst which several categories currently face various trading obstacles such as specific taxes, strict rules of origin, certification requirements and the such already, will be strained any further, resulting in higher costs for the importing party and hence the consumer.\nAVE also encourages the EC to assess beforehand the implications the introduction of such an instrument will most likely have on the current GSP-Scheme. This consideration should cover the climate policy of the countries benefiting from the GSP, and how the ‘Aid by Trade’-Approach and benefits related thereto can be maintained under such circumstances. These considerations should also be expanded regarding the application of this very instrument to trade partners with whom a free trade agreement is in effect, respectively being negotiated. AVE would further like to encourage the EC to establish reliable procedures on how to reflect such carbon border adjustments in the customs valuation process.\nWe will gladly remain at EC disposal for any further inquiries, as well as to deliver further input to this initiative.\nAVE (Foreign Trade Association of German Retailers) is the voice of retail importers in Germany. Since its foundation in 1952, it has represented the external economic interests of the German retail trade which needs friction-free import of all nature of consumer goods in the framework of its global purchasing policy.

        "feedback": "Border carbon adjustment is an effective alternative to carbon tax to combat unfair competition;\nIt is the most immediate and simple application of carbon dioxide in its most immediate and simple application to ask importers of raw materials subject to the ETS (European carbon market) such as steel, aluminium, cement, etc. to buy the CO2 emission allowances corresponding to their carbon performance on the market, as is the case for all European producers since 2008. this alternative to the carbon tax for concentrated CO2 emitters constitutes effective commercial protection for jobs in Europe in the face of unfair competition from all walks of life.\nThis tool makes it possible to combine the protection of skilled workers and the fight against climate change. \nReplacing steel with aluminium, paper, petrol or cement, produced in Europe by their Asian or American source substitute and a very high CO2 emissions generator. on the other hand, it is a question of assessing the impact on consumer prices and thus the purchasing power of Europeans, but it is very low. It would range from EUR 100 to EUR 150 on the price of a vehicle at a CO2 price of EUR 30 per tonne.\n\nThe adjustment cannot stop at the inclusion of live emissions from the manufacture of the products. It must incorporate the emissions directly from the production of the energy and raw materials needed to produce them: Iron ore for steel, bauxite for aluminium, petroleum for refined petrol This is a requirement for the battery industry for electric vehicles than France and Germany are in the process of building. Encouraging virtuous forms of production in the countries supplying primary raw materials reinforces the rationale of the approach, while at the same time encouraging the product to be traced back to the product location throughout the sector, it was not possible to stop them taking into account direct emissions from the manufacture of the products. It must incorporate the emissions directly from the production of the energy and raw materials needed to produce them: Iron ore for steel, bauxite for aluminium, oil for refined gasoline... This is a requirement for the battery industry for electric vehicles that France and Germany are in the process of building. Encouraging virtuous forms of production in the countries supplying primary raw materials will strengthen the rationale of the approach, while at the same time encouraging the relocation of production throughout the sector.\nWe are no longer Kyoto in 1997 where the industrialised countries were still the only countries of the triad, Europe, the USA and Japan, where developing countries were not required to reduce their CO2 emissions in the name of debt, sub-development. everything has changed radically in 2001 with China’s entry into the WTO, which is a great deal of change in the world economy. Indicators for developing CO2 are gradually becoming a factor of deindustrialisation in the countries of triad. For example, countries such as France emit CO2 without CO, as they dusted but saw their imported emissions skyrocketed, thus remaining responsible for a planet that burns without participating in the emergence of sustainable productive solutions.",

They are required by the EU's climate mitigation policy to perform a deep transformation, and massive investment, towards climate neutrality before 2050. 1.2 The purpose of the current Emissions Trading System (ETS) is to incentivise this investment by setting a price for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with contradictory requirements: (1) achieving climate goals requires higher prices, but (2) the external competitiveness of REIs requires them to align with the low or even non-existent price of external competitors. 1.3 The EESC is concerned by the risk of carbon or investment leakage (production or investment being carried out where ETS does not apply) in REHs, and of resulting job losses, in the current situation of divergent prices for GHG emissions on global markets. 1.4 In a previous opinion’, the EESC called for a global ETS in order to create a level-playing field in international competition between REIIs. This hope has so far been disappointed. 1.5 The EESC considers it essential to reconcile industrial and energy policies with climate policy in order to mobilise the huge investment made necessary by the transition to a zero-carbon economic model for REIIs, which should be a \"just transition\", with the social partners being actively involved in its definition and implementation. 1.6 Investment by the EU and the Member States should have a bearing on RDI and on deployment of low to zero-carbon technologies for REIIs, including the additional electric power generation that they require, and education and training of their workforce. Under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2021-2027), the funding included for this purpose in the Commission's proposal for the InvestEU programme and for the other investment programmes that will be linked to it should thus be increased. 1.7 The EESC intends to contribute to the reflection on the long-term industrial strategy called for by the European Council’, by examining the technical and legal feasibility of one among many policy options currently in the public sphere: the implementation of border adjustment measures (BAMs) for the internal price of GHG emissions, based on the GHG emissions content of the basic metals, chemicals and materials embedded in industrial goods._It points out that it drew attention to the need to examine and potentially introduce a mechanism of this kind back in 2014, in its own-initiative opinion \"Market-based instruments — Low carbon economy in the EU\", but did not get an adequate response from the Commission or the Council.\nConclusions and recommendations\nOFC 71, 24.2.2016, p.57, §1.9.\nEuropean Council conclusions of 22 March 2019, EUCO 1/19.\nOJ C 226, 16.7.2014, p. 1.\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 3/10\n1.8 The EESC advises the Commission to deepen its reflection on this and other policy options, such as a reformed ETS, carbon border adjustment’, a VAT rate adjusted to carbon intensity”, and to compare them in terms of:\nimpact on carbon and investment leakage, in a future situation of higher prices and lower\navailability of ETS allowances in the EU\nlegal certainty on compliance with WTO rules\nacceptability by trading partners\ntechnical feasibility, specifically regarding the existence of globally accepted accounting\nand measurement standards and of reliable and recognised databases.\n1.9 The EESC also advises the Commission to engage early in consultations with the EU's main\ntrading partners to test their views on the options considered.\nGeneral comments\n2.1 The dilemma of climate policy applied to resource- and energy-intensive industries\nClimate policy is confronted with an inherent difficulty.\n2.1.1 On the one hand, the purpose of this policy is to ambitiously reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (both from the combustion of fossil fuels and from industrial processes). The target for the EU is to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, as encouraged by the Commission's Communication \"A clean planet for all\". With these reductions, global warming should remain well below 2°C and hopefully below 1.5°C, in a way that is compatible with agriculture that is able to feed humankind. In a market economy, a very efficient tool is to set a price for GHG emissions. In this way, economic players can either profitably invest in emissions-saving equipment or processes (including Carbon Capture and Storage/Use) or can save money by reducing their consumption of materials (e.g. by using longer-lasting products) or by switching their purchases of materials towards those that produce fewer GHG emissions (such as recycled materials). In order for this method to be effective, the price for GHG emissions must be high and predictable enough to trigger investment or behaviour change.\n2.1.2 On the other hand, energy costs represent a high proportion of total costs for REIs: 25% for steel, 22-29% for aluminium’, 25-32% for glass’.\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 4/10\nEuropean Parliament resolution of 16 December 2015 on developing a sustainable European industry of base metals (2014/2211(IND).\nA.

The case of the flat glass industry\", CEPS, 2014, available at: https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/Glass.pdf\n2.1.3 If the energy cost is increased because of a high price allocated to GHG emissions in the EU compared with prices elsewhere, and because of large-scale and early investment in low- or zero-emissions technologies in REIs and in the related electricity generation, transport and storage capacities needed to feed them’, causing high amortisation costs, the external competitiveness of EU-based REIIs is jeopardised. Despite their energy-efficiency efforts, they end up producing at higher prices than their external competitors. On these markets, with very standardised products, a higher price leads to a loss of market share and related jobs. If this happens, GHG emissions are simply transferred from EU producers to producers elsewhere (who often are less energy-efficient), with (at best) no effect on global GHG emissions. This phenomenon is known as \"carbon leakage\". In a global competitive landscape where the price of GHG emissions is zero, this translates into the need to set the price of carbon as low as possible — and even at zero.\nThis phenomenon is compound by that of \"investment leakage\". Even with a low price for GHG emissions in the EU, the uncertainty regarding its development is already hindering investment in the maintenance and upgrade of REII industrial sites, leading to another and very worrying loss of competitiveness for EU producers. Investment leakage for EU-based REIs would dramatically increase if the prices for GHG emissions were high in addition to being volatile.\n2.1.4 The Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the current attempt on the part of the EU to set a price for GHG emissions. For the most part it has been ineffective: the price for GHG emissions has been very low for years (even if it rose recently) yet sufficiently volatile to trigger investment leakage. In addition, it is complex and full of exemptions. One structural reason for this ineffectiveness and complexity may be that the ETS system was not able to solve the inherent difficulty, outlined above, between conflicting requirements for high and low prices for GHG emissions.\nThere may thus be a need to solve this dilemma and reconcile the conflicting policy goals of (1) climate change mitigation and (2) the external competitiveness of Europe's REIIs, while heeding all other policy objectives, such as free and fair trade, in the framework of the long- term industrial strategy called for by the European Council.\n2.2 Border remedies as a possible solution\n2.2.1 The option preferred by the EU institutions to solve this dilemma would be for a single, global ETS to set a world-wide price for GHG emissions. This hope however has been disappointed. The recent geopolitical developments in the direction of unilateralism provide little hope that such a world-wide agreement would be reached in time.\nThe provisions set out by the European Commission (recycling ETS proceeds to industry, innovation support, free allowances, authorisation for Member States to compensate for indirect costs ...) may not deliver enough safeguards against carbon or investment leakage in a situation\nAccording to a study by T. Wyns (\"Industrial Value Chain: A Bridge towards a Carbon Neutral Europe\", VUB-IES, 2018, available at: https://www.ies.be/node/4758), mapping 11 European REIIs, the wide-scale deployment of low-CO, technological pathways would require between 2 980 TWh and 4 430 TWh additional electric energy per year.\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 5/10\nof asymmetric climate policies and increasing EU climate ambitions. This is why several voices have called for alternative approaches to reconciling climate policy goals with the external competitiveness of REIIs, as a possible solution. These approaches relate to the concept of BAMs as defined by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The purpose of this opinion is to explore the technical and legal feasibility of such an option, by means of a concrete proposal. 2.3 The legal principles of the WTO: border adjustment measures for internal taxes on consumption should not discriminate against external economic players. 2.3.1 The principle of BAMs is as follows: when an internal tax on consumption is established in a jurisdiction, there is a risk that local producers (who are subject to this tax) will be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to their external competitors (who are not), both on the internal market (where the competition is between local producers and importers), and on export markets. The authorities of this jurisdiction are allowed to restore the fairness of competition by: (1) imposing a tax on imported goods and (2) refunding the tax on exported goods. 2.3.2 Provided they met certain conditions, product-related BAMs were accepted as legal by the WTO, without any concerns being raised regarding protectionism, following a review of such adjustments dated 1970” (Report by the Working Party on Border Trade Adjustments). These conditions state that they should not discriminate against external economic players (Articles II- 2a, III-2 and VI-4 of the GATT agreement’), which means in this case that: imported goods should pay a tax no higher than that of local producers and exported goods should be refunded no more than the tax that has already been paid on the local market. 2.4 The envisaged mechanisms: a transparent accounting system for exporters; importers pay only for the GHG emissions content of the basic materials 2.4.1 The mechanisms envisaged to adapt the general idea of BAMs to the context of GHG emissions are the following: e in order to determine the amount to be re-funded to exporters, a transparent accounting system keeps track of the GHG emissions incorporated in each industrial item, and brings it forward along the value chain, as an additional line in invoices; importers pay the GHG emissions embodied in the basic materials used to make the industrial item, but not the GHG emissions used to transform or shape them, nor of their logistical movements. It is a very good approximation, because more than 90% of the GHG emissions of an industrial item are embodied in the basic materials. It provides undisputable evidence for the customs authority to determine the tax base (the nature and weight of each material). It also gives a slight advantage to importers, so that they cannot claim that they are discriminated against.\nGATT, \"Report by the Working Party on Border Trade Adjustments\", 1970, available at: https://www.wto.org/gatt_docs/English/SULPDF/90840088.pdf, specifically § 4, 11 and 14.\n10\nAvailable at: https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gatt1994_e.htm.\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 6/10\nThese mechanisms are presented and discussed in greater detail below.\n2.5 Refunding the price of GHG emissions incorporated in exported goods is a matter of accounting 2.5.1 The system would be as follows. When an REII has had to pay for its GHG emissions (either in the form of ETS allowances bought at a variable price per kg of CO eq on a market or in the form of a carbon tax at a fixed price), it must keep track of this payment (and of the underlying volume of GHG emissions) in its accounting system, and forward it to its customers in its invoicing (including an amortisation of the GHG emissions content of its equipment). This would re-use the existing, elaborate system of GHG accounting that was developed in the EU for the sake of computing free allowances for ETS, and which is a clear asset. The experience gained over the last 50+ years with regard to VAT should demonstrate the technical feasibility of such a cost-forwarding scheme. 2.5.2 The position in the supply chain at which this payment should be included in invoices remains to be defined. If it were brought forward to the final consumer, this would have the following consequences: it would bring the proposed scheme closer to the template of an internal tax on consumption, such as VAT or excises, for which the WTO has explicitly accepted the legitimacy of BAMs, and would thus increase legal certainty; it would avoid penalising intermediate companies; it would incentivise consumer behaviour towards more climate-friendly options. 2.5.3 When a company exports a good incorporating expenses for GHG emissions, it must then draw from its accounting system the GHG emissions content of the exported product, and have this content refunded by the state (either by re-selling the corresponding ETS allowances on the market, or by having the carbon tax paid back) for the volume of GHG emissions contained in the product. 2.5.4 If the current free allocation of ETS allowances to best-performing EU producers were maintained, this re-fund would be made at the average cost of an ETS allowance at the scale of the EU economy, based on the spot market price and the proportion of free allowances issued to EU producers. 2.5.5 This accounting system proves that the exporter is being refunded the exact cost for all the GHG emissions that had been incorporated into the product along the supply chain. The exporter is not being given an undue advantage, and the system is therefore in line with WTO requirements. This fairness is easier to prove on a case-by-case basis when the price for GHG emissions is fixed (as in a carbon tax). It is however only valid on average, between lucky and unlucky speculators on the ETS markets, and between high- and low-performing EU producers receiving different allocations of free emission rights, when the price for GHG emissions is variable (as in an ETS market).\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 7/10\n2.6 The remedy on imported goods can be based on the GHG emissions content of the incorporated basic metals, chemicals or materials\n2.6.1 The GHG emissions content of an industrial good can essentially be found in its materials.\nThe GHG emissions content of an industrial good can be split into three main components, each corresponding to different categories of value-adding operations:\nthe GHG emissions content of the basic metals, chemicals and materials that make up the product, directly or indirectly (e.g. steel, ethylene, benzene, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, glass, wood, ...); the GHG emissions content of the industrial operations transforming and shaping the basic metals, chemicals or materials (e.g. polymerising, moulding, machining, cutting, ) . b the GHG emissions content of the intra- and inter-site logistics between the various value- adding stages.\nThe vast majority of the GHG emissions content of an industrial product lies in that of the incorporated basic metals, chemicals and materials (specifically when they are non-recycled). The example of a machine-processed piece of steel, where the energy used in the process is 2.8 kwh! whereas the energy embodied in the material’? is 117 kWh, i.e. 40 times more, illustrates the order of magnitude of the relative weight between these components. In the case of fertilisers, plastics, elastomers, solvents, lubricants and textile fibres, a very dominant fraction of the GHG content of the final product lies in the basic chemicals from which they were manufactured, which can be deduced from their formula. This means that the full GHG emissions content of an industrial product can be approximated by the GHG emissions content of the incorporated basic metals, chemicals and materials °\n2.6.2 Computing the remedy applicable to imported goods\n2.6.2.1 In order for the customs authorities in charge of managing the BAMs to work efficiently and with legal certainty, both for themselves and for the importing company acting in good faith, both the tax base and the tax rate must be established with minimal room for interpretation or legal dispute.\nThe tax rate when considering GHG emissions pricing is either a requirement to purchase ETS allowances for the volume of GHG emissions incorporated in the imported product, at the same price per ETS allowance as in the refund for exporters (in the case of a market-based system), or the carbon tax rate (when under a fixed rate regime).\n11\nYohei Odaa, et al.: “Energy Consumption Reduction by Machining Process Improvement’, 3rd CIRP Conference, 2012, available at: http:/Asiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/17172.pdf.\n12\nInventory of Carbon and Energy (IEC), available at: http://www.circularecology.com/embodied-energy-and-carbon-footprint- database.html.\n13\nThese emissions are generally positive. They can be negative in the case of sustainably-grown, bio-sourced materials (e.g. wood).\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 8/10\n2.6.2.2 The tax base must be verifiable by analysing the imported good itself, which is the least disputable piece of evidence. In the case in question, the ideal tax base would be the full GHG emissions content of the imported good.\nDetermining the full GHG emissions content of an industrial product is difficult because of the complexity of all value-adding operations that have been performed on it along the value chain, many of which leave no trace in the product itself.\nThe proposed option is to use the simple but workable approximation outlined above: the full GHG emissions content of the imported good is approximated by the GHG emissions content of the incorporated basic metals, chemicals or materials, restricted to those representing more than e.g. 1% of the total mass. Micro-electronics, which generate large GHG emissions despite their small mass, would still be included in the calculation.\nThe total GHG emissions content of the materials present in the item is computed as follows: the mass of each kind of basic metal, chemical or material present in the item in significant proportion is multiplied by the GHG emissions intensity of this basic metal, chemical or material (i.e. the GHG emissions embedded in each kilogram of this basic metal, chemical or material).\nThe average GHG emission intensity at the level of each country has been determined for most basic metals, chemicals and materials. The figures are available in a range of publicly available databases (listed e.g. in the GHG Protocol’), based on well-developed Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies, including for China.\n2.6.2.3 In order to encourage and reward lower GHG emissions intensity in individual facilities and the divulgation of data, the following virtuous circle mechanism is proposed.\ne If a producer can reliably demonstrate its real GHG emissions intensity, then this value applies to its products being imported to the EU. If, however, no such reliable data is provided, then the average GHG emissions intensity of the country of origin is used, this average being computed on the remaining production and remaining GHG emissions when those that have provided reliable data are deducted.\nThereby, the most climate-friendly producers in a country will engage in the accounting exercise first (in order not to be penalised by application of their national average). Because of this, the national average, after these \"virtuous\" producers have been taken out of the computation, deteriorates over time, incentivising additional producers to provide reliable data.\n14\nThe full list of databases providing data on GHG emissions for various materials and processes is accessible at: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/life-cycle-databases.\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 9/10\n2.6.2.4 The EU could, in addition, provide technical support to companies abroad in setting up the reliable GHG emissions accounting systems required, and thus continue its current friendly stance towards trading partners.\n2.6.2.5 In order to prevent unscrupulous players from unduly attributing the low GHG emissions intensity from one facility to the production of another one, a traceability system, e.g. based on blockchain, could be developed and used.\nBrussels, 17 July 2019.\nLuca JAHIER\nThe president of the European Economic and Social Committee\nCCMI/167 — EESC-2019-00927-00-02-AC-TRA (EN) 10/10"

Es ist noch völlig unklar, wie ein solcher Mecha- nismus ausgestaltet sein soll und welche Sektoren davon betroffen sind. Die Auswirkungen eines Grenzausgleichsmechanismus (GAM) können sowohl für einzelne Industrien als auch für die gesamte Volkswirtschaft weitreichend sein.\n1. Einseitige Wettbewerbsverzerrungen zu Lasten europäischer Unternehmen\nIn der EU sind die Energiewirtschaft und energieintensiven Industrien wie die Nichteisen(NE)-Metall- industrie vom EU-Emissionshandelssystem (ETS) erfasst. Die Unternehmen der erfassten Sektoren müssen für ihre Treibhausgasemissionen Emissionsrechte (Zertifikate) erwerben. Einen solchen CO;- Zertifikatepreis müssen die industriellen Wettbewerber in Drittstaaten in der Regel nicht zahlen. Dadurch sind europäische Unternehmen, die im internationalen Wettbewerb stehen, grundsätzlich benachteiligt gegenüber ihrer Konkurrenz. Die Europäische Kommission hat bereits angekündigt, beim Klimaschutz noch ambitionierter sein zu wollen. Damit steigt die Gefahr einseitiger Wettbe- werbsverzerrungen zu Lasten europäischer Unternehmen.\nDarüber hinaus erhalten Wettbewerber beispielsweise in China signifikante Energiesubventionen. Häufig befinden sich dort Kraftwerke und NE-Metallhütten gemeinsam im staatlichen Eigentum. In China haben sich die Subventionen in den vergangenen fünf Jahren sektorübergreifend mehr als ver- doppelt.’ Die Inlandspreise für die Energieproduktion werden in China staatlich unterstützt. Die Folgen sind u. a. signifikante Verzerrungen bei den Produktionskosten und Wettbewerbsnachteile, vor allem für die deutsche NE-Metallindustrie. Aus dem OECD-Bericht „Measuring distortions in international markets: the aluminium value chain“ geht hervor, dass 17 Aluminiumfirmen in der Zeit von 2013-2017 rund 70 Mrd. USD an staatlicher Unterstützung erhalten haben, wovon die ersten fünf chinesische Firmen waren.?\nNeben den Verzerrungen im Bereich der Energie- und Klimapolitik gibt es weitere im Arbeits- und Ge- sundheitsschutz sowie im Umweltschutz, zu denen insbesondere Vorgaben zu Luftreinhaltung, Ge- wässer- und Bodenschutz gehören. In diesen beiden Bereichen haben europäische und insbesondere deutsche Unternehmen teils die höchsten Auflagen weltweit. Diese hohen Standards erfordern er- hebliche Investitionen, erhöhen den bürokratischen Aufwand und verursachen höhere Betriebskos- ten als im weltweiten Durchschnitt. Nur wenn ein GAM auch diese Aspekte berücksichtigt, kann ein level-playing-field erreicht werden. Zudem wird die Überprüfung von Umwelt- und Gesundheits- schutzauflagen in der EU wesentlich strenger gehandhabt als in Drittstaaten wie China.\n\"Taube, Markus (2017): „Analysis of Market-Distortions in the Chinese Non-Ferrous Metals Industry”, THINK!DESK Research & Consulting.\n2 OECD (2019): „Measuring distortions in international markets: the aluminum value chain“, OECD Trade Policy Papers No. 28, S.7 ff.\n2. Ausgestaltung eines Grenzausgleichsmechanismus (GAM)\nUm Wettbewerbsverzerrungen auf allen Märkten zu beseitigen, sollte ein GAM sowohl auf Im- als auch auf Exporte angewendet werden. Importe aus Regionen mit geringeren oder fehlenden Klima- schutzvorschriften werden an der EU-Grenze mit einem CO»-Preisaufschlag versehen. Andersrum er- halten in der EU produzierte Güter, die aus der EU exportiert werden, die nicht durch bestehenden Carbon-Leakage-Schutz kompensierten CO>-Kosten erstattet.\nDamit ein GAM wirksam ist, sollte er nicht nur bei Primärerzeugnissen ansetzen, sondern auch bei Halbzeugen und Endprodukten, da sonst ein Großteil der gehandelten Erzeugnisse unberücksichtigt bleibt. Andernfalls könnte zusätzliches Abwanderungsrisiko auf die nächste Stufe der Wertschöp- fungskette verlegt werden, mit negativen Folgen für die Volkswirtschaften der EU. Für einen Automo- bilhersteller wäre es demnach deutlich günstiger, in einem Drittstaat zu produzieren als in der EU, weil er dort seine Grundstoffe und Halbzeuge günstiger bekommt und diese dann ohne Zuschlag in der EU absetzen kann. Bei der Erfassung von Endprodukten wäre dies nicht der Fall. Allerdings er- scheint eine exakte Erfassung aller relevanten CO»-Kosten entlang der Wertschöpfungskette äußerst komplex.\nDie Komplexität wird erhöht durch die Erfassung der indirekten CO>-Kosten durch einen GAM. Indi- rekte Kosten sind die CO>-Kosten, die Stromerzeuger in der EU in Form von Zertifikaten zahlen und ihren Kunden weiterreichen. Die NE-Metallindustrie ist innerhalb der energieintensiven Industrien eine besonders stromintensive, da in der Vergangenheit viele emissionsintensive Prozesse elektrifi- ziert wurden. Der Anteil der indirekten CO>-Emissionen beträgt ca. 80%; der Anteil direkter CO,-Emis- sionen ca. 20%. Daher ist für die NE-Metallindustrie die Berücksichtigung der indirekten CO>-Kosten ganz entscheidend für die Wirksamkeit eines GAM. Folglich würde eine ungenügende Kompensation der indirekten CO>-Kosten unmittelbar dazu führen, dass die stromintensive Industrie während der Transitionsphase der europäischen Energieerzeugung hin zu CO>-freiem Strom nicht mehr im interna- tionalen Wettbewerb geschützt wäre.\n3. Kein Ersatz für Carbon-Leakage-Schutz\nDer bestehende Carbon-Leakage-Schutz darf durch die Einführung eines GAM nicht verringert, ge- schweige denn abgeschafft werden. Er kann, wenn überhaupt, nur ergänzend dazu eingeführt wer- den. Dies liegt vor allem an folgenden zwei Gründen:\nErstens ist schon der heutige Carbon-Leakage-Schutz mangelhaft. So erhalten die effizientesten Kup- ferhersteller und -recycler in der EU lediglich rund 50% Strompreiskompensation; in der Aluminium- industrie beträgt der nicht-kompensierte Anteil der indirekten CO>-Kosten bis zu 92% des Gewinns je Tonne Aluminium. Zwar gibt es keinen eindeutigen Indikator, der Carbon Leakage zweifelsfrei nach- weist, aber es gibt seit einiger Zeit ernstzunehmende Anzeichen:\no Im Gegensatz zum Bruttoanlage-Vermögen des gesamten verarbeitenden Gewerbes, das in den letzten 20 Jahren gestiegen ist, ist das Bruttoanlage-Vermögen in den energieintensiven Industrien Deutschlands seit 2000 kumuliert um ca. 18% gesunken.? Zugleich haben die ener- gieintensiven Industrien umfangreiche Investitionen im Ausland getätigt, die explizit mit niedrigeren Energiekosten begründet wurden (Investment Leakage).* Die Anzahl der Aluminiumelektrolysen ist in den letzten Jahrzehnten deutlich zurückgegan- gen.\n3 Bardt, Hubertus (2019): „schrumpfender Kapitalstock energieintensiver Branchen“, IW-Kurzbericht 12/2019. * Heymann, Eric (2019): „Deutsche Industrie Wenige Sektoren tragen Investitionswachstum“, in: Deutschland- - Monitor, Deutsche Bank Research.\no Bedarf an und Nachfrage nach NE-Metallen sind in den vergangenen Jahren gestiegen.” Die Metallproduktion in der EU ist trotz der deutlich gestiegenen Nachfrage nur marginal ange- stiegen, da die zusätzliche Nachfrage durch Importe gedeckt wurde. Der Anteil Asiens z.B. an der weltweiten Kupferproduktion ist von ca. 25% in 1990 auf ca. 60% in 2017 angestiegen. Der Anteil Chinas an der weltweiten Aluminiumproduktion ist von ca. 10% in 2000 auf ca. 60% in 2017 angestiegen. Die wachsende Importabhängigkeit von Grund- und Werkstof- fen stellt ein Risiko für die gesamte industrielle Wertschöpfung in der EU dar.\nZweitens bindet ein geringerer Carbon-Leakage-Schutz Kapital in erheblichen Umfang, da die Produk- tionskosten erhöht werden. Dies wirkt sich negativ sowohl auf Wachstum und Beschäftigung als auch auf Investitionen am Standort Europa aus. Aufgrund der Kapitalbindung ist es für jeden Unternehmer attraktiver, zu niedrigen Kosten in einem Drittstaat zu produzieren und bei Einfuhren in die EU eine Zusatzzahlung zu tätigen als — gerade in energieintensiven Sektoren - zu äußerst hohen laufenden Kosten in der EU zu produzieren und für seine Exporte eine Zahlung zu erhalten.\n4. WTO-Konformität muss gewährleistet sein\nGrundlage des internationalen Handels und Wertgrundlage für die NE-Metallindustrie ist das Recht der Welthandelsorganisation (WTO). Ein CO2-Grenzausgleich sollte mit dem WTO-Recht korrespon- dieren. Diesbezüglich ist die Sachlage nicht ganz eindeutig. Einige Rechtsgutachten bezeichnen Um- weltabgaben als nicht-konform mit dem WTO-Recht. Dies stellt keine juristische Entscheidung dar. Andererseits räumt die WTO in ihrer Präambel die generelle Option ein, zugunsten des Umwelt- schutzes temporäre Handelshemmnisse einzuführen. Ein Beispiel dafür ist, dass die EU einen Grenz- ausgleich für den Handel mit Beton in Erwägung zog und erfolgreich mit WTO-Juristen eine mögliche WTO-konforme Version eines CO»-Grenzausgleichs erarbeitete. Ein GAM sollte WTO-konform ausge- staltet sein.\n5. GAM provoziert protektionistische Retorsionsmaßnahmen\nJeder Grenzmechanismus, der Güter verteuert, könnte sich negativ auf das Handelsvolumen auswir- ken. Damit sind auch die Auswirkungen auf die Gesamtwohlfahrt der europäischen Volkswirtschaften negativ, da insbesondere die Kaufkraft aufgrund der Verteuerung verringert wird. Dies gilt umso mehr für handelsorientierte Volkswirtschaften.\nEin erheblich größerer Schaden auf die Volkswirtschaft kann durch potenzielle Retorsionsmaßnah- men von Drittstaaten entstehen. Das Bekenntnis zum Freihandel hat sich zuletzt in einigen Regionen abgeschwächt. Im Handelskonflikts zwischen den USA und China wird verstärkt mit protektionisti- schen Maßnahmen gedroht und es wurden bereits solche Maßnahmen in Kraft gesetzt. Hinzu kommt die Besonderheit, dass ein europäischer CO,-GAM eine selbstverursachte Wettbewerbsverzerrung beseitigen soll. Denn schließlich ist es die EU, die den CO>-Ausstoß der hiesigen Industrie verteuert und nun gedenkt, Importe ebenfalls zu verteuern. Das offizielle Verkünden der USA, zum 4. Novem- ber 2020 aus dem Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen auszusteigen, zeigt den Stellenwert von Klima- schutzmaßnahmen für die USA. Daher ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit von protektionistischen Retorsions- maßnahmen hoch.\n6 Grenzausgleich ist kein geeigneter Ersatz für globales Klimaschutzinstrument\nIm Idealfall gibt es ein globales Klimaschutzinstrument mit einheitlichen CO>-Kosten für alle Akteure.

Background\nO Agrupacién de fabricantes oficemen de cemento de Espafia\nOFICEMEN is determined to contribute strongly to the EU’s vision for a carbon neutral society by 2050 and support the objectives of the European Green Deal.\nThe European Green Deal recognizes that the cement industry is indispensable to Europe’s economy, as it supplies several key value chains. As key construction materials for renewable energy equipment, sustainable buildings and mass transit transport, cement and concrete indeed offer the opportunity to accelerate the creation of a carbon-neutral Europe.\nThe “Masterplan for Energy-Intensive Industries (Ells)”, an outcome of work of the High-Level Group on Energy-intensive Industries, sets that the legal framework for products should bridge the current situation with the development of future markets without creating distortions or competitive disadvantages. During the transition, continued support for energy intensive industries (such as cement industry) should safeguard competitiveness and investments in Europe. This process requires a smart combination of offensive and defensive market creation strategies in order to maximize the benefits for EU’s economy and society.\nThe cement industry is a key enabler to a carbon neutral society through its end-product, concrete, that is the material of choice for building the renewable energy assets (including wind turbines and hydro-electric dams), and the sustainable buildings and infrastructure of tomorrow. The cement industry is local (from raw material to end-product), present across the EU territory, and plays an important role for both the EU social cohesion and the wider economy.\nWith 27% CO2 emission reductions achieved in the Spanish cement manufacturing since 1990, the cement industry is on track to achieve its 80% emission reduction target by 2050, using conventional technologies and the successful deployment of carbon capture and storage/use’. OFICEMEN and CEMBUREAU, the European cement association, are currently in the process of re- assessing these targets with a view to setting out the cement and concrete’s industry’s pathway to achieve carbon neutrality along the value chain in Europe by 20507.\nAlready today, the European cement industry deploys a wide range of technologies and innovation projects at every step of the cement production process. These include the development of alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels in heating processes’, improved energy efficiency of kilns, low-clinker cements, innovative binders, innovative concrete solutions, up to the development of carbon capture and storage/use technologies where the industry is leading the way through several pilot programmes in Europe.\nThe cement sector’s efforts to reduce its environmental footprint and support a carbon neutral economy are further explained on our Low-carbon economy website.\n1 Please The road for reducing carbon emissions by 2050 OFICEMEN and The role of CEMENT in the see map , low carbon economy, CEMBUREAU\n? Please release European cement industry strives for carbon neutral cement and concrete along the see press value chain by 2050.\n3\nThe European cement sector is a global leader in the use of alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels which now account for 46% of the total energy mix. The alternative fuels are drawn from a variety of non-recyclable waste streams which puts the cement industry at the heart of the circular economy and makes it a major actor in the waste management policies at EU and national level.\nWorld cement production 2018, by region and main countries, % Estimations\n99 billion tonnes\ncisP;2,6% CEMBUREAU\n| EU-28; 4,4% non EU-28; 2,0%\nOceania P; 0,3%\nAmerica (excl.

Clinker is the CO>-intensive part of cement. It is formed through the calcination of limestone into lime, and then through a reaction with the other constituents of the raw materials at temperatures of 1450° C (including e.g. clay, shale) to form clinker.\nAlready today, the European cement industry faces a significant risk of carbon leakage, both at the EU’s land borders and ports through the low price of long-distance shipping and waterway transport, which potentially allows large imports of cement or — much more often - clinker from countries not covered by the EU ETS (or by systems with equivalent rigour). This risk of carbon leakage has been partly recognised by EU policymakers in the EU ETS scheme through the free allowances mechanism, which is designed to provide a degree of protection to the European industry.\nStudies led by market analysts and external consultants show that, despite free allocation, the European industry is at a high-risk of carbon leakage.\nThe rules for the calculation of free allocation have indeed been reviewed for the phase IV of the EU ETS (2021-2030), with a reduction of both the Historical Activity Level (HAL) and the emission factor benchmark. As a result, it is expected that, as early as 2021, free allocation will be insufficient to meet EU demand for clinker and normal export activity, resulting in a free allocation shortage. The shortage of free allowances will translate into increased production costs for clinker production. At aCOz price of €28/tonne, each marginal tonne of clinker produced in the EU above the level of free allowances will increase its production cost on average by €23/tonne of clinker during the period 2021-30.\nBecause of these increased production costs, clinker produced in non-ETS countries will become increasingly competitive, if these countries do not incur the same level of COz2 costs. In this context, producing locally in the EU (and paying the CO2 related cost) will be less competitive than importing\nO oficemen\nAgrupacién de fabricantes de cemento de Espafia\nCement sector has a high exposure to carbon leakage\nIn 2017, the cement production of the current 28 Member States of the EU was 175.1 million tonnes, about 4.3% of the total world production (4.1 billion tonnes). There are over 200 installations in the EU, and the cement industry directly employs over 35,000 persons in the EU.\nSource” CEMBUREAU\nO oficemen\nAgrupacién de fabricantes de cemento de Espafia\nfrom non-ETS offshore locations (with the additional cost of transporting the product to the EU). The impact will be felt across Europe. It will be particularly strong in regions which are more exposed to clinker and cement trade, due to their location at the EU’s land borders, or their proximity to key sea shipping routes (please see map below).\nFor CO2 prices of €28/tonne, in line with Commission expectations, the expectation is that Phase IV will lead to a risk of offshoring 40 million tonnes of EU clinker production by 2030 (equivalent to >20% of EU demand). For CO2 prices of €72/tonne, 58 million tonnes of EU clinker production will be at risk of offshoring by 2030. Because of production offshoring, emissions will not decrease at a global level, but rather be displaced and increased due to the additional direct and indirect emissions, as well as increased transport emissions. Such offshoring would also have significant social and economic impacts.\nIsolines' of EU vs. non-ETS production (2030)\nCO, price\nWi <€10/ton\nMH €10-20/ton\n@® €21-28/ton\n+ >€28/ton\nExports at risk of\noffshoring for CO, prices\nabove €5/ton\n3. Competition is sharply increasing at the EU’s doorstep\nThis risk of carbon leakage is further heightened by recent trends observed in the EU’s neighbouring markets:\ne Installed capacity is rising at the EU’s doorstep: the build-up of 70 million tonnes of integrated new capacity is taking place between 2018 and 2025 in countries surrounding the EU, and part of that could be exported to the EU market.\nThus, for example, EU market is under increasing pressure from major cement producing countries of the Mediterranean basin and which are not subject to regulation on CO2 emissions. Turkey has doubled its cement exports from 2016 to 2019 and Algeria has increased them exponentially:\n2016\n0\n11.4\n2017\n0\n12.9\n2018\n0.5\n13.8\n2019°\n2.5\n22.1\n4 The Global Cement Report.

Investment increasing in cement plants new capacity has been developed in the last years, offering an over-capacity in all the Mediterranean area. This over-capacity represents approximately 50% of EU cement market. The gap between domestic consumption and cement capacity is shown in the following table:\nCement capacity (Mt)\nDomestic\nExport\nconsumption (Mt) capacity (Mt)\n38.4\n25.16\n13.24\n141.0\n46.93\n94.07\nThese countries do not face the same constraints on carbon emissions as European cement producers, increasing the threat to the competitiveness of the European cement industry. In combination with the aforementioned increased capacity, there is a sharp drop in cement demand in Middle-East/Northern Africa (-10% in Algeria and -5% in Libya and Egypt). This will heighten the risk of exports to the EU.\nAn example of this risk the spectacular increase imports into the EU during 2104-2018\nes\n2019\nVariation % variation\n1,074,436 1,988,669\n914,232\n85%\n17,420\n571,055\n553,635\n3,178%\n179,063\n450,409\n271,347\n152%\n20,516\n288,188\n267,671\n1,305%\n[Morocco\n23\n243,735\n243,712 1,050,481%\n95,866\n241,553\n145,687\n152%\n16,251\n155,896\n139,645\n859%\n32,040\n168,267\n136,227\n425%\n51,606\n164,638\n113,032\n219%\n1\n110,530\n110,529 11,052,890%\n125,010\n2,029 -122,981\n-98%\n270,923\n121,014 -149,909\n-55%\n\n2,470,054 5,164,405 2,694,350\n109%\nO Agrupacién de fabricantes oficemen de cemento de Espafia\nIn parallel production facilities in the EU continue to be closed.

This effort to connect with markets such as Turkey and Belarus are seen as a prelude to a phase in which China will begin acquiring assets in Europe. Last but not least, the last few months have witnessed the development of modular grinding plants in the EU, allowing clinker to be imported from outside the EU and grinding to cement taking place in the EU.\nIn conclusion, the European cement industry faces a risk of carbon leakage that is already underway, despite the partial free allocation of allowances under the ETS. In the absence of a level playing field, it is likely that the EU industry will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in increased market shares of less CO2-efficient cements and risks of factory closures, with consequent social implications, across the EU. This competitive disadvantage will further increase as the EU implements ambitious CO2 reduction policies as part of the European Green Deal, unless similarly ambitious policies are set up by third countries. It is therefore critical and urgent that a carbon border mechanism is put in place.\n4. An EU Carbon border mechanism could play a decisive role in building a level playing field on carbon emissions\nOFICEMENconsiders that an EU carbon border mechanism can play a decisive role towards both domestic and international action on climate change:\ne A well-designed mechanism would allow the creation of a level playing field between the European cement industry and third countries producers’, ensuring that they pay the same carbon price to place products on the EU market and that they compete on the same carbon price base when placing products internationally. It should thereby prevent carbon leakage, and ensure the European industry competes on an equal footing with third country producers when delivering investments to reach carbon neutrality; An EU carbon border mechanism would support the EU’s efforts to foster climate ambitions in third countries and thereby lead to deeper carbon emission reductions worldwide. Third country producers will be incentivised to reduce their carbon emissions; and third country governments will be encouraged to set up domestic carbon pricing schemes with equivalent vigour to the EU system; In designing a carbon border adjustment and reaching out to third countries to address their programs for emission reductions, appropriate attention needs to be paid to already existing agreements or arrangements with these third countries such as a customs union, a linking arrangement, a trade or association agreement. If some third countries already have certified bodies in place, recognised by the EU, that can assess the emissions levels of plants in third countries, this can be a facilitating factor in the application of the mechanism. A carbon border mechanism would also offer a long-term signal to investors across the EU, thereby supporting the upscaling of low-carbon technologies; Last but not least, revenues generated by the carbon border adjustment could also be used to foster research and deployment of low-carbon technologies in Europe.\nHowever, these expected benefits will largely depend on the design of such carbon border mechanism.\nO oficemen\nAgrupacién de fabricantes de cemento de Espafia\n5. OFICEMEN proposals for an effective and fair an effective and fair mechanism.\nA variety of models have been discussed for carbon border mechanisms. OFICEMEN considers that the objective of any mechanism is that it should result in EU producers and third country importers paying the exact same price for the carbon emissions they emit.\nOFICEMEN, in cooperation with CEMBUREAU, has developed five key design principles for such instrument, which are listed below.\nPrinciple 1: In an initial phase, an EU carbon border mechanism must be complementary to the EU ETS free allowances\nIn an initial phase corresponding to phase IV of the EU ETS (2021-2030), OFICEMEN considers that the instrument should take the form of a carbon adjustment mechanism, and be complementary to the EU ETS. An adjustment charge should be applied to third country imports to ensure that importers face the same carbon price than EU producers under the ETS. This adjustment charge should be fair and consider the free allowances received by the European industry.\nAs explained above, energy-intensive industries such as cement already face a shortfall of allowances under the ETS rules, increasing the production cost and the risk of production being offshored. In this context, the introduction of a cross border mechanism combined with an immediate loss of free allowances would create considerable uncertainty and risks.\nBesides, having a carbon border mechanism set up while maintaining free allowances for EU producers during an initial phase provides distinct advantages:\ne It would provide a stable framework for low-carbon investments to happen. The industry has taken the current EU ETS Directive (adopted in 2018) as a basis for long-term investment decisions, including for investments needed to decarbonise the sector in the coming years. This legal certainty would again be put into question by the introduction of a cross border mechanism which would, for EU producers, impact the free allowances system, before the expiry of EU ETS Phase IV; It allows the level of free allowances received by EU producers to be taken into account in the setting of the adjustment paid by importers; thereby starting with a smaller amount. This is ideal for a testing phase, given the many uncertainties surrounding the implementation of a carbon border mechanism (WTO compatibility, trade retaliations...); It minimises distortions of competition between different sectors which are covered by the EU ETS.\nFurthermore, it is important to underline that the existing system of free allowances was adopted in order to address one specific type of carbon leakage, namely the offshoring of a number of sensitive industries from the EU to countries with less stringent carbon costs. Addressing emissions in imports, which is also essential to prevent carbon leakage, is not tackled by the current ETS carbon leakage measures. This is why the two carbon leakage policies — ETS designed with free allowances on the one hand, and a carbon border adjustment to reduce third countries’ emissions on the other hand — should be viewed as separate and evolve independently of each other, as opposed to being seen as “alternatives” to each other.\n© oficemen\nAgrupacién de fabricantes de cemento de Espafia\nOFICEMEN believes it is perfectly possible to design a mechanism that takes into account the free allowances received by the European industry to determine a fair adjustment charge for importers. The adjustment paid by importers would simply be reduced to consider free allocation, including the fact that free allocation would reduce over time (e.g. through a cross-sectoral reduction factor or to meet the new 2030 target).\nPrinciple 2: A carbon border mechanism must be based on verified emissions from importers to t h e EU, not ‘average emissions’. It should include indirect emissions.\nFor any mechanism to be successful and fair, it is important that it is based on actual and verified emissions. This is particularly crucial in the case of cement, where various types of cement with different carbon intensity can be produced.\nThird country producers’ emissions could be determined in a two-step mechanism:\ne Third country producers would use an EU-accredited certification body to determine the CO2 content of their product; If a third country producer fails to produce such certified document, the CO2 content of their product would be based on a corrected average CO2 emission value for the clinker/cement produced in the exporting country, for instance taking the worst 20\" percentile. This would incentivise third country producers to be transparent on their emissions. Recognition would be made for third country CO2 emissions schemes and these would be factored in when determining the CO2 charge for imports from the third country.\nIn addition, the adjustment mechanism should also include costs associated with indirect emissions. The European cement industry is indeed exposed to significant indirect costs, which are foreseen to rise in the future (e.g. following the electrification of production processes and introduction of CCS). It is therefore fair that importers face the same costs.\nPrinciple 3: A carbon border mechanism must follow a very transparent methodolo and be fully WTO-compatible\nTo create a predictable framework for low-carbon investments (new technologies, equipment and infrastructures), it is essential to have sufficient guarantees that the mechanism would not be retracted at an unexpected moment, for instance following a WTO ruling.\nThere is abundant literature available on the issue of carbon border mechanisms, which seems to indicate that it is perfectly possible to design a WTO-compatible instrument. As explained above, it is however important to keep free allowances during an initial phase, to ensure that the industry is not left unprotected should legal (or political) disputes arise.\nIn assessing WTO compatibility, specific attention needs to be paid to respecting the non- discrimination rule which is most likely to be respected when a “mirror-image” system to the EU ETS is designed for third country producers. In such case, however, it is important to determine from which source third country importers would buy allowances, i.e. from the EU ETS allowances volume or, as suggested in the discussions with the French Government, from a virtual volume of allowances.\n© oficemen\nAgrupacién de fabricantes de cemento de Espafia\nOFICEMEN would also encourage the EU to discuss the design of a mechanism that would encourage third countries to adopt similar carbon reduction measures as to those applied to European producers.\nPri . nciple 4: An EU carbon border mechanism be licable all alike must a, to sectors\nWe understand that the cement sector is considered as a potential ‘pilot sector’ for carbon border mechanisms. We think it is however important that as many sectors as possible are included — the principle should be that the carbon border mechanism will be applicable in the widest sense and should not seek to differentiate between sectors.\nIf a mechanism is limited to only a few sectors or sub-sectors, it will inevitably create distortions of competition on the EU internal market. These market distortions would have a significant impact on downstream markets such as the construction sector. We therefore believe that a carbon border mechanism should apply to all the sectors covered by the EU ETS.\nPrinciple 5: A carbon border mechanism should provide for an CO2 charge exemption for EU exporters\nFinally, a carbon border mechanism should provide for a CO2 charge exemption for EU exporters to third countries, if the third country in question is not covered by a carbon pricing mechanism.\nAs the climate ambition of the EU increases, leading to an overall increase of CO2 costs, European cement plants will face increasing competitive disadvantage in relation to producers in third countries. This will result in lower access to export markets for the European industry, with a negative impact on global CO2 performance.\nThe carbon border mechanism should therefore include a CO2 charge exemption for exports of EU plants. This would act as a further incentive to ensure third countries set up carbon pricing schemes, with an international Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) in place. Such export rebate can be designed as compatible with WTO rules under the so-called destination principle which requires that operators exporting to a third country should be treated the same way as the domestic operators in that country.\nIn the long-term, other forms of mechanisms could be envisaged\nThe above principles focus on the creation of a carbon border adjustment mechanism running in parallel to the EU ETS in the coming years. We believe that such model would be the most practical and realistic, at least until the end of phase IV of the EU ETS in 2030.\nHowever, after this date, different forms of carbon border mechanisms could be envisaged. The mechanism could continue to run in parallel to the EU ETS, as described above. Alternatively, the creation of a CO2 consumption charge applied indistinctly to EU and non-EU products could also be envisaged. Such form of mechanism would present opportunities, but also has complex ramifications and impacts which should be analysed. OFICEMEN stands ready to support this work in due course.\n10"

It is clear that trade policy has an important role to play in this regard.\n\nProducers in the EU are faced with growing demands and requirements with regard to environmental and climate performance. While avoiding carbon leakage caused by imports of products which are more carbon intensive than their EU equivalents might be helpful in ensuring high ambitions in carbon reductions and a level playing field, efforts must be made to ensure that any action taken is fully in line with WTO rules and other agreements concluded by the EU. Regardless of the form that the carbon border adjustment mechanism would take, designing a WTO-proof instrument will be tricky because this is basically uncharted territory in international trade law. This type of measures have not to date been put in place by any country, let alone tested in the WTO system. In this context, it will be necessary to make sure that the administrative burden the scheme would create is not such that it will in practice deter imports.  \n\nIt will be equally crucial to thoroughly consult all trading partners and representatives of the affected sectors throughout the legislative process. Even a carefully designed and well intended mechanism could unintentionally become a significant barrier to trade and/or discriminate against certain operators. We seek to avoid that any new policy instrument will be interpreted as a discriminatory and protectionist measure by third country trading partners. We have seen on multiple occasions, for instance in the EU-US aircraft dispute, whereby measures deemed protectionist and trade distorting in non-agricultural sectors had a knock-on effect on agricultural goods. Retaliatory tariffs, import bans or other trade restrictive measures are the last thing the EU dairy sector, which has suffered a huge number of demand shocks lately, needs. Care needs to be taken that milk production is not shifted from Europe to other regions where it is less efficient and has a higher carbon foot print. This is exactly what will happen if European dairy exports are hit with additional barriers. Eucolait calls on the Commission to take a sensible and measured approach, which does not restrict imports or create trade tensions.\n\nMoreover, with respect to any possibility that carbon border adjustment could be extended directly to imports of agricultural products, given the very marginal imports of dairy products imported into the EU annually (and mainly from Switzerland) we feel it would be appropriate to exclude dairy from this discussion.\n\nFinally, in light of the corona pandemic which is currently raging, we feel it would be appropriate to postpone the discussion on this and other initiatives under the Green Deal and to focus all efforts on tackling the short and long term consequences caused by the virus.

        "feedback": "Iberdrola welcomes the EU initiative to assess the proposal of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBA) to enhance EU climate targets, reduce the risk of carbon leakage and avoid distortions on international trade ensuring that the price of imports reflect accurately their carbon content, preserving World Trade Organization-WTO rules and other international obligations of the EU.\nThe introduction of a CBA in the UE under the compliance of WTO rules has to deal with five practical challenges:\n•\tEnsure equal treatment for internal and external products coexistent with the ETS and the EU energy taxation. This may convey the discussion on certain critical issues such as a) the integration of importers into the ETS, b) the existence of carbon taxes for final consumers, and inevitably c) the compatibility with the free allowance to industries in risk of carbon leakage.\n•\tIntroduce climate change into international trade rules: Climate change is a global environmental risk, but climate protection or climate change mitigation are not so far explicitly quoted. The Paris Agreement subscribed by 195 countries opens the time to considerate climate issues into the international trade rules, either as the basis for a standard or technical rule or as an exception. The OMS addressed in COP24 climate change as a risk for human health.\n•\tThe imposition of a CBA based on the carbon content of an import. The current interpretation of trading rules understands that 2 products are equivalent as far as they are perfect substitutes and respond to the same consumer demand. From this perspective, a CBA based on actual carbon content would require agreement at WTO level. However, the introduction of WTO standards and/or technical rules relative to carbon content may facilitate the differentiation of the products and accordingly their treatment vis-à-vis border taxes. Standards on carbon emission best practices and climate friendly products could be explored to support CBA.\n•\tThe treatment of different countries with different commitments in climate action. The WTO rules impose equal treatment for all the countries which may be controversial when dealing with States with radical different positions relative to environmental targets and tools. Hence the elaboration of transparent and validated technical standards may provide a tool to implement CBA.\n•\tThe destination of the funds raised through the CBA. The WTO rules exclude explicitly the use of export subsidies. However, nothing excludes to allocate part/all the funds towards general budget needs and more specifically, towards decarbonistation and sustainability targets. Earmarking a relevant part of the funds to transfer to developing countries for decarbonisation purposes in the context of the Paris Agreement is not only compliant with WTO rules but would help offsetting the controversies around the CBA.\nFull internalisation of industry’s GHG emission cost is key to ensure that such cost is passed through the value chain setting up strong incentives from the producers to the consumers. Tackling the carbon leakage issue through free allocation of CO2 allowances in the most exposed industries has been effective in terms of protecting the sectors in risk of transferring emissions from unfair international competition through relocation, but ineffective in terms of preserving the incentives to decarbonise because is neither of universal application for other sectors under unfair international competition (eg electricity sector) nor avoids effectively carbon emissions. \nThe CBA represents a new approach which could either fully replace the existing carbon leakage measures or complement them while global robust CO2 mechanisms develop. Besides, indirect CO2 costs (like those internalised in electricity costs) could also be tackled through the CBA. Additionally, this approach should be framed in within an intense climate diplomacy activity – leaded by the EU – and aligned with UNFCCC climate negotiations.  ",

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nHigh EU standards can have the de facto effect of exporting those standards to companies wishing to sell into the EU market. This is most clearly seen, for example, in the health and safety of imported foods or chemicals complying with REACH. This de facto effect is not incompatible with trade law.\n4.

An ‘as such’ review examines whether the national law itself is compatible with WTO law. An ‘as applied’ review examines whether the WTO member has acted in breach of WTO law when applying the national law.\nThe shape or architecture of the EU’s carbon border measure must aim at ‘as such’ compliance.\n6. The Architecture of a border measure must address the EU’s climate objective\n[W]e consider that a measure’s purposes, objectively manifested in the design, architecture and structure of the measure, are intensely pertinent to the task of evaluating whether or not that measure is applied so as to afford protection to domestic production.\nAB Chile-Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages, December 1999\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator and the second highest indirect emissions intensity among the 8 eligible sectors.\nThe European Steel Association\n1920\nIndirect emission\nTrade\nleakage indicator\nintensity\n(GOS instead of GVA)\nintensity\n[kg CO2 / EUR GOS]\nINAcE | 203-2015 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015\n1411 |Manufacture ofleatherclothes|__—_—3,029_— | 83,00% | 3,650\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\nefined petroleum products\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nSimilarly, the section 3.1.1 on aid intensity and degressivity of the consultants’ study assesses the impact of indirect costs (with a carbon price of 25€/t) after 75% compensation taking into account the GVA. In such assessment, among the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has around the fourth indirect costs impact (after 75% compensation), which is comparable to the sectors with the lower impact (blue bars below). Yet, if labour costs are excluded from the denominator (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector have very clearly the second highest impact (orange bars below), with a large difference above the remaining sectors.\nIndirect CO2 costs after 75% compensation\n5,4%\n5,0%\n4,3%\n4,0%\n2,9%\n3,0%\n2,3%\n2,1%\n2,0%\n1,9\n1,8%\n:\n1,39\n1,3%\n1,6%\n0 99\n0,99\n0,89\n0,9\n1,0%\n0,7\n0,69\n0,0%\n&\nxe)\nny\nCo\nSS\nov\n<2\nNo\nSS\nx2\n¥\ns\nNS\nRS\n<O\nSs\n<O\ngf\n&\ney\nS\nR\nNs\nSy\nBS\nAS\nNe’\nSS\n6\nRo\ny\nRNa\n»\nwv?\n&\nae\n&\ns”?\n<8\nSs\nKO\n‘Sy\ne\nPS\nwv?\n&\n<O\noe\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GVA\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GOS\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nThe above analysis is even more relevant if one considers the profitability of the eligible sectors.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages.

Increased protectionism worldwide\nThird countries’ trade restrictions have increased since the imposition of the EU definitive safeguard measures, increasing the risk of trade diversion to the weakened European market\na Threats of the U.S. President to double again the 25% tariff on Turkish steel imports illustrates the extreme volatility in the implementation of the Section 232 policy on\nThe European Steel Association\n11\nsteel — and the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy (which is itself a source of deflection). Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

Today, the EU PA segment may cover only about 25 % of EU demand the rest being imported. \nDuring the same period of time, the EU DS aluminium segment has been growing to meet EU demand and compete on third markets. Thus, the EU DS segment is completely import dependent of unwrought PA metal which surprisingly remains subject to EU import duties varying between 3 % - 6 %. \nThis on-going EU trade policy severely increases EU market prices of unwrought PA and negatively affects competitiveness of the whole EU DS segment which today represents approximately 90 % of the turnover and jobs in the EU aluminium sector. Most EU DS producers are SMEs. \nCBAM as to the DS segment. As DS aluminium producers are paying growing ECT costs and are competing with unfairly priced imports, FACE supports the introduction of a CBAM  for all imported aluminium semis and finished products in EU. \nFACE would like to stress that the future CBAM must be WTO compliant and cover all products of all sectors with similar carbon footprint (and not only steel, cement and some other sectors as currently contemplated by the Commission), except for areas which could be excluded on the basis of objective and transparent criteria, such as lack or non-existence of EU domestic production, like in case of the PA segment. \nCBAM as to the PA segment. CBAM is not an appropriate measure for the PA segment from the point of view of the two pillars of carbon leakage. It would only increase costs of the DS segment further and lead to massive closures and/or leakage of that important sector of the EU economy abroad, and would become another EU trade policy measure, along with the current EU import tariffs on PA. \nInstead of including the PA segment into the CBAM, the Commission is invited to consider immediately a PA import tariff suspension repeatedly requested by FACE and DS SME’s. Such suspension would serve the EU Green Deal and what the EU wants to achieve with the CBAM if the EU suspended the current import tariffs on low carbon PA  faster (within the next few months) and deeper (zero tariff). Such full tariff suspension would be a perfect example of a timely measure taken in harmony with several important EU policies, such as environmental, industrial and trade. Moreover, such measure would constitute an urgently needed economic stimulus for the EU aluminium industry in the COVID-19 context.\nContact: r.bertozzi@face-aluminium.com",

The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nKey findings\nThe competitive advantage of the EU aluminium industry lies in the technological leadership of the downstream segments, 1.e. producing semi-finished products for many end-user industries. The downstream segments account for about 70% of the annual turnover of EU aluminium industry and for nearly 92% of the total industry employment. In the last twenty years, the EU aluminium industry has experienced massive structural changes with a strong decline of aluminium primary production and underinvestment being the leading trend. Rising dependency on imports of unwrought aluminium and intensifying competition from third countries are increasingly becoming key factors influencing the competitiveness of EU downstream activities. Other than unwrought aluminium, EU has constantly worsened its trade balance in all segments of semi-finished aluminium products over the period 2000-2017. EU import tariffs on unwrought aluminium have been ineffective in sustaining primary aluminium production, while they are imposing additional costs to downstream transformers and potentially repealing the effects of trade measures on semi-finished products. It can be estimated that up to 17.8 billion euros was the extra cost of the tariff for unwrought aluminium for EU downstream producers over the period 2000-2017. In the same time, import tariffs have resulted in additional revenues for EU primary and secondary (recycling) producers, as well as additional incomes for primary producers with duty-free access to EU internal market. From a policy perspective, EU trade measures should be placed in a broader industrial policy framework aimed at preserving and possibly reinforcing the competitiveness of the downstream activities and, in turn, of the EU aluminium industry as a whole. To this end, the study suggests to abolish import tariffs on unwrought aluminium, to define ad- hoc measures for primary and secondary production and to provide incentives to downstream transformers to expand their innovative and technological capabilities, to improve their sustainability in a circular economy perspective, and to enhance, including with the tools of the so-called fourth industrial revolution, the relationships with relevant end-user industries.\n2\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nExecutive summary\nContext and objectives of the study\nThe aluminium industry is an industry that is essential to the economy of modern countries as it provides a range of highly differentiated products, from those for final consumption to the intermediate inputs that are required for many high-tech industries. Aluminium is currently used as an input material in the manufacturing of investment goods (automotive, shipbuilding, aerospace, building and construction, mechanical and electrical engineering), and consumer goods (like mobile devices, computers, recreational vehicles, household appliances, etc.). Regarded as one of the most sustainable metals, aluminium is increasingly used by companies strongly committed to improving their environmental performance.\nThe global aluminium industry has undergone fundamental changes in recent years in terms of geographical relocation of production and consumption, degree of concentration and integration, development of new end-use markets, increasing financialisation, and international trade. Globally, China’s role has increased substantially in all segments of the aluminium value chain as well as in the consumption of aluminium products, to the detriment of North America and the EU.\nThe decline in the EU aluminium industry has been particularly severe in the upstream segments of the value chain, causing an increasing unwrought aluminium deficit and rising costs of raw materials. This trend has, in turn, progressively affected the competitiveness of downstream companies, which represent the bulk of the EU aluminium industry in terms of turnover, value added and employment.\nThe structural changes in the aluminium industry have sparked renewed interest in trade policies’ role in driving economic development and in influencing the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector as a whole. The aluminium industry was recently at the core of the international debate on protectionist measures mainly because of the decision taken by the US administration to impose additional import tariffs on aluminium products. In the EU, the aluminium industry is one of the sectors that has featured most prominently in the anti-dumping investigations which have taken place since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.\nAs a result, the need for a comprehensive revision of trade rules has become increasingly clear, to take into account the greater complexity of international production and to place those measures in a broader industrial policy framework.\nAgainst this background, the purpose of this study is threefold:\nto provide a comprehensive overview of the EU aluminium industry value chain; to quantitatively estimate the economic impact of the EU import tariffs on unwrought aluminium in terms of additional costs imposed on other segments further down the value chain;\n-\n3\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nto strategically assess the role of import tariffs on unwrought aluminium as an industrial policy instrument for promoting the competitiveness of downstream activities and the EU aluminium industry as a whole.\nSome policy recommendations are finally made with the aim of preserving the technological leadership, as well as possibly restoring the industrial competitiveness, of firms producing semi-finished products, while also helping the EU to achieve its sustainability and industrial renaissance targets.\nOverview of the EU aluminium industry\nThe aluminium industry includes a range of activities along the value chain. They can be divided into 3 main segments:\n1 upstream, including all the producers of the raw material from the unwrought mineral, namely the extractors (mining and quarrying) and the primary aluminium smelters; downstream, involving a broad group of producers manufacturing high differentiated outputs (so-called “wrought aluminium”, “semi-finished,” “semis,” or “mill products”) by rolling, extruding, casting and drawing unwrought aluminium into various forms; aluminium recycling and remelting, comprising producers of aluminium alloys (recyclers/remelters) from metallic waste and scrap generated either as a by-product of manufacturing or from recycled goods.\nFor the purpose of this study, recycling and remelting activities are included in the upstream segment as they both produce unwrought aluminium for the downstream transformers.\nThe EU aluminium industry encompasses more than a thousand companies, directly employs about 230.000 employees and is indirectly responsible for around 1 million jobs.\nLacking raw material (i.e. bauxite), the EU aluminium industry is actually characterised by few facilities which produce alumina (the white powder produced by the refining of bauxite) and by a limited number of companies which use alumina to produce primary aluminium in any form (commodity ingots and value-added products, such as slabs, billets, foundry alloys, and wire rods). Hundreds of small- and medium-sized vertically non-integrated firms are involved in the manufacturing of aluminium semi- finished products, such as extrusions, flat-rolled products, castings, foil, wire and slug.\nIt can be estimated that the aluminium downstream sector now accounts for about 70% of the annual turnover of the EU aluminium industry and for nearly 92% of the total employment in the industry, compared to 5% of the primary segment and 2% of the secondary segment. Secondary aluminium is produced by recycling and remelting aluminium-bearing scrap and/or aluminium-bearing materials.\nThe global positioning of primary aluminium production has dramatically changed over the last twenty years. China’s role has increased substantially to the detriment of North America and the EU.\nSince 2008, the EU’s production of primary aluminium shrank by 30%. A decreasing number of EU member states have operating aluminium smelters. Some primary aluminium producing countries, such as Italy, the UK, and the Netherlands, have significantly curtailed or definitively ceased their production in the last few years. As a result, the EU lost more than one quarter of its smelting capacity in the period from 2008 to 2017. The process of disinvestment is almost certain to continue, as Alcoa recently announced the closure of its three aluminium smelters in Spain.\n4\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSince 2004, the EU has produced more secondary (that is unwrought aluminium produced by recycling and remelting scrap and waste) than primary aluminium. As of 2017, however, secondary aluminium output has not yet matched pre-crisis levels.\nAs for semi-finished products, global manufacturing of aluminium extrusions, flat-rolled products (FRPs) and aluminium castings more than doubled over the period from 2000 to 2017. China has driven much of this expansion, now representing around 50% of global output of aluminium semis. The EU production of aluminium FRPs and aluminium castings has increased in the period from 2000 to 2017, but at a significantly slower pace than at the global level. In 2017, the EU production of aluminium extrusions was even slightly below 2000 levels, although global production has tripled in the same period. As a result, the EU’s share in global manufacturing of semi-finished aluminium products has constantly declined, from 29% in 2000 to 14% in 2017.\nGermany, Italy, and France are the largest producers of semi-finished products in the EU, representing about 62% of the EU’s total production in 2017. Germany further strengthened its leadership in the manufacturing of aluminium semis over the last few years and now constitutes about one third of the total production in the EU. France, Italy and Spain have roughly maintained their share of total EU production. Other EU member states have progressively seen their relative production shrink, cumulatively representing less than one quarter of EU total output in 2017.\nTrade flows of unwrought and wrought aluminium products\nOver the period from 2000 to 2017, the EU’s trade balance has consistently worsened in all segments of the aluminium value chain.\nEU imports of unwrought aluminium increased significantly during the period from 2000 to 2017. In particular, imports in 2017 were 69% higher than in 2000. Although EU exports of unwrought aluminium to third countries showed a significant upward trend over the last ten years, these exports only constitute a negligible quantity of EU trade flows, corresponding on average to roughly 4% of the imports. Between 2000 and 2017, the trade deficit of unwrought aluminium has thus steadily worsened.\nIn the same period, the EU trade balance in aluminium semi-finished products has also deteriorated.\nStructurally being a net exporter of FRPs, the EU has experienced an increasing trade deficit in the last four years. FRPs now account for the vast majority of the EU imports of semis (about 70%). The EU’s reliance on imported aluminium extrusions has also grown rapidly in recent years. In 2017, the EU net imports of aluminium extrusions were more than five times higher than in 2000. Finally, the EU is currently a net importer of aluminium castings, including aluminium road wheels as one of the main product categories. Much of the growth of EU imports of aluminium semis is due to the increase of Chinese imports to the EU. In 2017, the amount of aluminium extrusions imported from China was about 36 times higher than in 2000, imports of Chinese FRPs increased by 20 times, while the imports of aluminium casting from China rose 46 times.\nA notable exception to the EU trade imbalance is the trade surplus registered in the aluminium waste and scrap sector since 2002. This surplus has even increased over the last few years, notwithstanding the fact that secondary production is actually regarded as the most energy efficient method of producing aluminium—especially for countries with high energy and carbon costs and significant availability of secondary raw material. As waste and scrap are typically used as input for secondary production, the positive EU trade balance should be interpreted as an outflow of raw materials, although these are of\n>\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nlow quality and are very expensive to sort and process. Asian countries, such as China and India, are markets to which an increasing quantity of waste and scrap has been exported.\nEU trade policies on unwrought aluminium\nA complex system of import tariffs currently applies to unwrought and wrought aluminium products.\nWith regard to unwrought aluminium, after two successive autonomous temporary suspensions, adopted in 2007 and 2013, the conventional customs duty rates are respectively 3% for not alloyed aluminium, 4% for aluminium slabs and billets and 6% for foundry alloys. Unwrought aluminium can be imported into the EU duty-free from countries having signed Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with the EU and from less developed countries (SPGA) covered by the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP).\nOver the period 2000-2017, about half of the imports of unwrought, not alloyed, aluminium originated from countries with duty-free access to the EU market. The share of duty-free imports has increased in periods in which imports are sensibly lower in quantity, such as during the economic crisis. Among countries subject to the tariff, Russia accounts for slightly less than 38% of the EU’s total imports of unwrought, not alloyed, aluminium, also representing about 63% of the total imports subject to the tariff. Conversely, Mozambique (17%) and Iceland (16%) are the main exporters among duty-free countries.\nThe share of imports of aluminium alloys which were duty-free averaged 75% during the period 2000- 2017. Among countries with duty-free access to the EU internal market, Norway and Iceland are by far the leading exporters, accounting together for 57% of the EU’s imports of slabs and billets and 47% of the EU’s imports of foundry alloys. Among countries subject to duties, the UAE accounts for slightly less than 18% of total EU imports of alloyed slabs and billets in 2017 (equivalent to about 55% of the total imports subject to duties in the same year) and 16% of total EU imports of foundry alloys (about 39% of the total imports subject to duties in the same year).\nEU trade policy also offers companies the option of processing imported products without paying any duty. Companies can temporarily import raw materials or semi-manufactured goods from various countries, assemble or transform them so as to re-export the products for final consumption in third countries. In the period 2000-2017, the inward processing procedure was extensively used by EU companies both for not alloyed aluminium (averaging 43% of the total import subject to duties) and aluminium alloys (averaging 39% of the total import subject to duties).\nEstimates of the impact of import tariffs on unwrought aluminium on the aluminium industry value chain\nThe adoption of import tariffs is meant to increase prices of both imported and domestic goods. Given the regional market conditions and the structural characteristics of the EU aluminium industry, there is an incentive for domestic producers of unwrought aluminium, including those with duty-free access to the EU internal market, to align their prices with the highest possible level, namely the duty-paid price. This theoretical prediction is largely confirmed by findings of many studies focusing on the aluminium industry.\nThe price increase induced by import tariffs imposes extra costs on companies operating in segments further down the value chain, in particular on downstream transformers, while simultaneously representing a net transfer of financial resources to upstream activities.\n6\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAs such, they correspond to extra revenues for primary and secondary producers (in addition to revenue for EU customs). EU primary and secondary aluminium producers should in principle use the additional revenues to compensate for cost differences with respect to extra-EU competitors as well as to invest in improving their products and production technologies. Moreover, as a result of current PTAs, extra costs for EU downstream transformers also represent additional revenues for primary producers based in countries from which primary aluminium can be imported on a duty-free basis (mainly Norway, Iceland, and Mozambique).\nIncreasing international competition from developing countries and limited bargaining power vis-a-vis their customers have mostly prevented EU downstream transformers from further passing through the extra costs imposed by import tariffs down the value chain, thus progressively squeezing their margins and putting further pressure on their survival, in particular on SMEs. Whenever partial or full pass- through is possible, import tariffs would still result in higher prices of semi-finished products to the detriment of EU end-user industries and final consumers.\nTotal estimated cumulative extra costs sustained by EU aluminium downstream industry, net of inward processing, range from €9.7 to €17.8 billion in the period 2000-2017. Those additional expenses represent up to 75% of the turnover of the European downstream aluminium industry in 2015. This also implies yearly average extra costs ranging between €529 million and €1 billion.\nImpact on downstream transformers of the EU import tariffs on unwrought aluminium (2000-2017, € billion - real 2018\nExtra revenues\nCumulative\nDuty\nrevenues\nPrimary\nScenario\nextra-costs for\n(net of\nEU downstream\nEU primary\nproducers\nEU secondary\ntransformers\ninward\nwith\nduty\nfree\nprocessing)\nproducers\naccess to the\nproducers\nEU\nLower bound\n9,7\n2,5\n3,1\nUpper bound\n17,8\n4,6\n5,8\n* Duty net of inward processing of unwrought aluminium. revenues are Source: Authors’ own elabouration.\nThe largest share of the extra costs translated into extra revenues for remelters and refiners based in the EU producing secondary aluminium (33% of total extra costs). The price increase due to the EU import tariffs also led to extra revenues for EU smelters (28% of total extra costs) and for primary producers based in countries from which primary aluminium can be imported on a duty-free basis (26% of total extra costs).\nAssessing EU trade measures on unwrought aluminium from an industrial policy perspective\nAt the EU level, the task of supporting the aluminium industry was mainly left to trade rules, including the use of import tariffs as the main industrial policy measure. National measures were primarily aimed at sustaining existing upstream activities by lowering their energy costs, often as a part of a wider\n1,4\n2,6\n3,9\n4,8\n7\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nregulatory intervention for energy-intensive sectors. National governments were also left with the burden of dealing with the economic and social consequences of shuttered smelting facilities.\nThe import tariffs on unwrought aluminium were mainly justified by the need to prevent EU smelters from reducing their production or even shutting down their facilities, eventually moving them to countries with low energy and labour costs, as well as lax environmental regulations. In turn, this would make more difficult for EU producers of semi-finished products and end-user industries to reliably and competitively source unwrought aluminium and aluminium products.\nThe customs duty on imports of unwrought aluminium has not worked as expected in achieving the EU objectives.\nThe EU’s production of primary aluminium has decreased significantly because of the major curtailments and shutdown of numerous EU smelters. More than 11,300 jobs were lost in the upstream segment, including in the alumina and metal supply sectors, in the period 2002-2015. Consequently, the EU trade deficit regarding unwrought aluminium has considerably worsened and will be further exacerbated with the closure of additional smelters.\nIn 2017, the EU’s primary aluminium production was about 27% of the EU’s apparent consumption of primary aluminium. Furthermore, in the same year, as a consequence of several smelter closures, the total installed smelting capacity in the EU was instead equal to 30% of the EU’s apparent consumption of primary aluminium. The increasing demand for primary aluminium has been met by rising imports. Dependence on imported unwrought aluminium for the production of aluminium semi-finished and finished products has thus steadily increased.\nNo increases in production capacity or new entries in the unwrought aluminium segment are expected in the EU member states in the next few years. This will further increase the EU’s dependence on imports, as unwrought aluminium consumption is expected to grow, though at a slower pace than in the past.\nImport tariffs, having failed to sustain the EU’s primary aluminium production, have negatively affected the competitiveness of other segments of the value-added industrial chain, especially downstream users that are not able to pass through the price increase of unwrought aluminium.\nAn effective protection of segments further down the value chain would necessitate sourcing unwrought aluminium at the lowest possible costs, leaving aside any issues related to security and continuity of supply. The adoption of import tariffs works exactly in the opposite direction by potentially counteracting the effects of trade measures in downstream segments (i.e. import tariffs on semi-finished products). Not surprisingly, many countries such as China have adopted policies to make unwrought aluminium cheaper as to explicitly confer a cost advantage on domestic manufacturers of semis.\nThe overall effects are clearly visible. In 2017, EU production of aluminium extrusions was slightly below 2000 levels, although global production has tripled in the same period. The production of aluminium FRPs and castings has increased compared to 2000, but at a significantly slower pace than on the global level. In the period 2000-2017, the EU’s trade balance has constantly worsened in all sectors of aluminium semi-finished products, as consumption of semi-finished aluminium products has increased at a compound growth annual rate of 3% in the same period.\nThe impact has been different depending on the specifics of downstream producers, with specialised SMEs inevitably suffering more than vertically integrated companies. Better performing companies\n8\nThe EU aluminium industry. The impact of the EU trade measures on the competitiveness of downstream activities - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nhave generally been characterized by long-standing customer relationships—based on geographical proximity, flexibility and customization—with end-user industries.\nThe autonomous temporary suspension of customs duty, adopted in 2007 for not alloyed aluminium and in 2013 for aluminium slabs and billets, which was primarily intended to reduce input costs for downstream aluminium users while preserving the profitability of the upstream segment, has failed to reverse the described trends.\nIndustrial policy recommendations for the competiveness of the EU aluminium industry\nThe competitive advantage of the EU aluminium value chain undoubtedly lies in the technological leadership of the downstream activities. From a broader industrial policy perspective, it is thus essential to provide all the right support to maintain this leadership and possibly reinforce the economic and industrial competitiveness of firms producing semi-finished products and using aluminium products.\nOverall this report’s findings suggest the following policy recommendations:\n- Import tariffs on unwrought aluminium should be abolished. A customs duty on unwrought aluminium should not be regarded as the right policy instrument, as it artificially raises downstream costs without offering any appreciable results in supporting upstream production. The maintenance of primary aluminium production can be justified only through recognising its strategic value for the entire EU economy. Government intervention may be required to avoid being totally dependent on imports. Secondary aluminium production should be encouraged through appropriate support schemes other than customs duties (e.g. by promoting innovative sorting and separation technologies, consistent product design, etc.) and by creating incentives for the secondary raw materials produced in the EU to be increasingly recycled and reused domestically. Maintaining the technological leadership and possibly reinforcing the competitiveness of the EU’s semi-finished transformers would require policy measures other than simply reducing the costs these firms incur while procuring the inputs and intermediates. The suggested removal of import tariffs on unwrought aluminium would generate additional financial resources (estimated between 530 million and 1 billion euros per year) for EU downstream transformers’ investments. Incentives for downstream transformers should be primarily directed at expanding their innovative, research and technological capacities and at improving their sustainability, resource efficiency and environmental performances from a circular economy perspective. Finally, improving the competitiveness of the whole EU aluminium value chain requires enhancing, including with the tools of the so-called fourth industrial revolution, the collaborations and the relationships between EU semi-finished transformers and relevant end- user industries.\n9"

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

This is most clearly seen, for example, in the health and safety of imported foods or chemicals complying with REACH. This de facto effect is not incompatible with trade law.\n4. The Climate Border Measure should not be a tariff or import charge\nTo avoid a GATT Il inconsistency, the triggering of the imposition of the charge must not be importation itself but an internal factor such as consumption.\nAB in China-Auto Parts, January 2009\nGATT Article II prohibits the imposition of duties or charges of any kind in excess of the tariffs set out ina Member’s Country Schedule.\n5 ‘As Such’ and ‘As Applied’: the Architecture of the EU’s border measure\nWTO Panels and the Appellate Body judge if a measure is compatible with WTO law ‘as such’ or ‘as applied’. An ‘as such’ review examines whether the national law itself is compatible with WTO law.

The Architecture of a border measure must address the EU’s climate objective\n[W]e consider that a measure’s purposes, objectively manifested in the design, architecture and structure of the measure, are intensely pertinent to the task of evaluating whether or not that measure is applied so as to afford protection to domestic production.\nAB Chile-Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages, December 1999\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Increased protectionism worldwide\nThird countries’ trade restrictions have increased since the imposition of the EU definitive safeguard measures, increasing the risk of trade diversion to the weakened European market\na Threats of the U.S. President to double again the 25% tariff on Turkish steel imports illustrates the extreme volatility in the implementation of the Section 232 policy on\nThe European Steel Association\n11\nsteel — and the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy (which is itself a source of deflection). Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

European farmers, forest owners and their cooperatives are the first to feel the impact of climate change. Therefore, there are no climate change deniers in the European farming community. We are committed to implementing the Paris Agreement and support it as an essential part of the European and international political agenda. A global approach is needed to prevent carbon leakage and to lower emissions, while at the same time to meet rising demand for food. The agricultural and forestry sectors are indispensable partners to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nThe European agricultural and agri-food sector represents 44 million jobs, 3.5% of European GDP and almost one third of the European Union's positive trade balance, i.e. €21.5 billion. While 44 million jobs are linked to agri-food chain activities, around six million jobs are directly linked to agri-food chain exports. We estimate that 30% of the raw materials (mainly rare commodities) processed in the EU are of non-EU origin, which demonstrates the close ties between the European and the international market. This highlights the importance of including primary and processing sectors when mapping out a trade strategy for the European Union.\nCarbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)\nThe CBAM in principle could work as a measure to avoid carbon leakage in all sectors. It is of the utmost relevance in emission-intensive sectors in which the ETS system is already in place. Additional production requirements have to be corrected by a compensating adjustment mechanism.\nOur aim is to strengthen the current EU border protection for agricultural products. Any weakening of the EU’s current border protection for agricultural products could dramatically undermine efforts to reduce emissions, particularly in the livestock sector, and could well prevent a net global reduction in emissions. Due to the urgent nature of climate action, a chapter on the application of climate measures must be included in all free trade agreements.\nThe future does not lie in decreasing productivity and shifting production as well as climate impacts (carbon leakage and water scarcity) to third countries with lower standards. We have to make sure that the consumption of food and non-food products (bio-based fuels, chemicals and materials) complies with all the Sustainable Development Goals including trade policy.\nThe EU should, if necessary, suspend tariff preferences when non-compliance with the provisions of the agreement on sustainable development upsets the balance of competitive conditions for European producers.\nCopa - Cogeca | European Farmers European Agri-Cooperatives\n61, Rue de Tréves | B - 1040 Brussels | www.copa-cogeca.eu\nEU Transparency Register Number | Copa 44856881231-49 | Cogeca 09586631237-74\nCarbon pricing mechanisms in agriculture and forestry should be based on the carbon farming framework envisaged by the Commission and be compliant with the CAP. Within this scope, the carbon dioxide that farmers remove (negative emissions) would also be recognised in traded goods according to their production method.

Carbon border adjustments on agricultural goods must be based on the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles, including carbon sequestration. If agricultural and forestry products fall within the scope of the CBAM, principles should be elaborated in close cooperation with farmers and forest owners.\nAt this stage, no WTO member has established a similar mechanism, which therefore raises a number of technical, legal and political questions.\na The CBAM must be compatible with the WTO and other international trade commitments. It must minimise administrative burdens where possible (e.g. avoid double taxation or no taxation), and not have any adverse effects on the environment or climate. It is assumed that monitoring and reporting systems need to be in place. This is in order to understand whether the CBAM should be applied to a product or whether to provide a reduction or exclusion to a specific trade partner proven to have similar climate policies to the EU. In addition, the carbon pricing calculation of a specific product may evolve with technological advances. A carbon market place or crediting schemes should be part of the incentivising toolbox to deliver on climate objectives. Greater ambition with a diminished CAP budget will not produce results if the private sector is not properly involved. Farmers need stability and trust in order to make long-term investments to remain competitive and attractive. The CBAM should be thoroughly assessed and carefully thought through along the entire food chain. This is because it may also have an impact on the level playing field for EU production (e.g. imports of soya to feed EU poultry vs imports of poultrymeat from poultry fed with soya from third countries).

Such a mechanism is a fundamental tool for the implementation of an effective climate policy in a globalised economy and to ensure international competitiveness of European industries. The support of appropriate carbon pricing should send a clear message for long-term sustainable investment to back the transition to carbon neutrality by 2050 while preventing employment and market shares losses within the European Union. In this respect EPF calls on the European Commission to consider the following points when elaborating its proposals for a carbon border adjustment mechanism:\n\n•\tSince the actual calculation to decide whether an industry can be included into the carbon leakage list is based on the direct and indirect carbon costs of its products, the actual embodied carbon content of imported products should similarly be considered within the framework of the BCA mechanism;\n•\tIn order to avoid delocalisation and to promote effectiveness in carbon leakage prevention, all products’ related carbon emissions should be taken into account and specifically those related to transport. More specifically, the ‘cradle to gate’ approach for raw materials (EN 15804) within the framework of the Environmental Product Declaration fails to reflect transport carbon emissions. A common EN standard should therefore be developed to encompass transport related emissions for both EU manufactured and imported products;\n•\tMore stringent measures should be considered for imported products manufactured in non-EU countries that are not signatories of international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement;\n•\tAttention should be given to potential attempts to bypass the carbon border adjustment mechanism for imported semi-finished products. Exporters may try to bypass the mechanism by moving up or down the value chain to trade precursors or derivatives instead of the product itself.

Given the proposed increase of the EU’s climate ambition (also compared to other countries in the world) it is necessary to reflect the mitigation targets in trade policy in order to avoid carbon leakage (and as a consequence a global rise of GHG emissions). A carbon border adjustment mechanism should be practicable in daily international trade, especially with processed and „mixed“food. How to calculate it for a pizza? We need concrete concepts for this, also for imported products like nitrogen fertilizers. At least there should be a different tariff between countries who join the Paris Agreement and those who don’t.

Please release European cement industry strives for carbon neutral cement and concrete along the see press value chain by 2050.\n3\nThe European cement sector is a global leader in the use of alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels which now account for 46% of the total energy mix. The alternative fuels are drawn from a variety of non-recyclable waste streams which puts the cement industry at the heart of the circular economy and makes it a major actor in the waste management policies at EU and national level.\nThe cement industry is a key enabler to a carbon neutral society through its end-product, concrete, that is the material of choice for building the renewable energy assets (including wind turbines and hydro-electric dams), and the sustainable buildings and infrastructure of tomorrow. The cement industry is local (from raw material to end-product), present all across the EU territory, and plays an important role for both the EU social cohesion and the wider economy.\nWith 15% CO2 emission reductions achieved in cement manufacturing since 1990, the cement industry is on track to achieve its 80% emission reduction target by 2050, through the use of conventional technologies and the successful deployment of carbon capture and storage/use’. CEMBUREAU is currently in the process of re-assessing these targets with a view to setting out the cement and concrete’s industry’s pathway to achieve carbon neutrality along the value chain in Europe by 20502.\nAlready today, the European cement industry deploys a wide range of technologies and innovation projects at every step of the cement production process. These include the development of alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels in heating processes’, improved energy efficiency of kilns, low-clinker cements, innovative binders, innovative concrete solutions, up to the development of carbon capture and storage/use technologies where the industry is leading the way through several pilot programmes in Europe.\nThe cement sector’s efforts to reduce its environmental footprint and support a carbon neutral economy are further explained on our Low-carbon economy website.\n2 The international environment — cement has a high exposure to carbon leakage\nIn 2018, the cement production of the current 28 Member States of the EU was of 179.8 million tonnes, about 4.4% of the total world production (3.99 billion tonnes). There are over 200 installations in the EU, and the cement industry directly employs over 35,000 persons in the EU.\nWorld cement production 2018, by region and main countries, % Estimations\n3.99 billion tonnes\nCIS P; 2,6% CEMBUREAU\nOceania P; 0,3%\nEU-28;4,4% non EU-28; 2,0%\nAmerica (excl.

Carine India)p;\n|\nSource: CEMBUREAU\nJapan; 1,4%\nDespite partial free allocation under the EU ETS, the European cement industry faces high risks of carbon leakage, which needs to be addressed urgently\nCement is traded on European and world markets either as final product or as clinker. Clinker is the COz-intensive part of cement. It is formed through the calcination of limestone into lime, and then through a reaction with the other constituents of the raw materials at temperatures of 1450° C (including e.g. clay, shale) to form clinker.\nAlready today, the European cement industry faces a significant risk of carbon leakage, both at the EU’s land borders and ports through the low price of long-distance shipping and waterway transport, which potentially allows large imports of cement or — much more often - clinker from countries not covered by the EU ETS (or by systems with equivalent rigour). This risk of carbon leakage has been partly recognised by EU policymakers in the EU ETS scheme through the free allowances mechanism, which is designed to provide a degree of protection to the European industry.\nStudies led by market analysts and external consultants show that, despite free allocation, the European industry is at a high-risk of carbon leakage.\nThe rules for the calculation of free allocation have indeed been reviewed for the phase IV of the EU ETS (2021-2030), with a reduction of both the Historical Activity Level (HAL) and the emission factor benchmark. As a result, it is expected that, as early as 2021, free allocation will be insufficient to meet EU demand for clinker and normal export activity, resulting in a free allocation shortage. The shortage of free allowances will translate into increased production costs for clinker production. At a COz price of €28/tonne, each marginal tonne of clinker produced in the EU above the level of free allowances will increase its production cost on average by €23/tonne of clinker during the period 2021-30.\nAs a consequence of these increased production costs, clinker produced in non-ETS countries will become increasingly competitive, if these countries do not incur the same level of CO2 costs. In this context, producing locally in the EU (and paying the CO>z related cost) will be less competitive than importing from non-ETS offshore locations (with the additional cost of\ntransporting the product to the EU). The impact will be felt across Europe. It will be particularly strong in regions which are more exposed to clinker and cement trade, due to their location at the EU’s land borders, or their proximity to key sea shipping routes (please see map below).\nFor COz prices of €28/tonne, in line with Commission expectations, the expectation is that Phase IV will lead to a risk of offshoring 40 million tonnes of EU clinker production by 2030 (equivalent to >20% of EU demand). For CQz2 prices of €72/tonne, 58 million tonnes of EU clinker production will be at risk of offshoring by 2030. As a consequence of production offshoring, emissions will not decrease at a global level, but rather be displaced and increased due to the additional direct and indirect emissions, as well as increased transport emissions. Such offshoring would also have significant social and economic impacts.\nIsolines' of EU vs. non-ETS production (2030)\nCO, price\nMl <€10/ton\nMH €10-20/ton\n#4\n@ €21-28/ton\na >€28/ton\nExports at risk of\noffshoring for CO, prices\nabove €5/ton\nCompetition is sharply increasing at the EU’s doorstep\nThis risk of carbon leakage is further heightened by recent trends observed in the EU’s neighbouring markets:\ne Installed capacity is rising at the EU’s doorstep: the build-up of 70 million tonnes of integrated new capacity is taking place between 2018 and 2025 in countries surrounding the EU. Surplus capacity in those countries - which can vary significantly based on rapid changes in local demand due to political or economic turmoil — is likely to rise in the next years, which will lead to increased exports into the EU28. These countries do not face the same constraints on carbon emissions as European cement producers, increasing the threat to the competitiveness of the European cement industry. In combination with such increased capacity, there is a sharp drop in cement demand in Middle-East/Northern Africa (-10% in Algeria and -5% in Libya and Egypt). This will heighten the risk of exports to the EU. Furthermore, several land corridors with China are currently being developed through the Belt and Road initiative. One of the corridors is China-Eurasia, the goal of which is to accelerate railway trade between China and Europe via_ Brest-Litovsk (Poland/Belarus border). This effort to connect with markets such as Turkey and Belarus are seen as a prelude to a phase in which China will begin acquiring assets in Europe.\ne Last but not least, the last few months have witnessed the development of modular grinding plants in the EU, allowing clinker to be imported from outside the EU and grinding to cement taking place in the EU.\nIn conclusion, the European cement industry already faces a risk of carbon leakage, despite the partial free allocation of allowances under the ETS. In the absence of a level playing field, it is likely that the EU industry will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in increased market shares of less CO:-efficient cements and risks of factory closures, with consequent social implications, across the EU. This competitive disadvantage will further increase as the EU implements ambitious CO2 reduction policies as part of the European Green Deal, unless similarly ambitious policies are set up by third countries.\n3\nAn EU Carbon border mechanism could play a decisive role in building a level playing field on carbon emissions\nCEMBUREAU considers that an EU carbon border mechanism can play a decisive role towards both domestic and international action on climate change:\ne A well-designed mechanism would allow the creation of a level playing field between the European cement industry and third countries producers’, ensuring that they pay the same carbon price to place products on the EU market and that they compete on the same carbon price base when placing products internationally. It should thereby prevent carbon leakage, and ensure the European industry competes on an equal footing with third country producers when delivering investments to reach carbon neutrality; An EU carbon border mechanism could support the EU’s efforts to foster climate ambitions in third countries and thereby lead to deeper carbon emission reductions worldwide. Third country producers will be incentivised to reduce their carbon emissions; and third country governments will be encouraged to set up domestic carbon pricing schemes with equivalent vigour to the EU system; In designing a carbon border adjustment and reaching out to third countries to address their programs for emission reductions, appropriate attention needs to be paid to already existing agreements or arrangements with these third countries such as a customs union, a linking arrangement, a trade or association agreement. If some third countries already have certified bodies in place, recognised by the EU, that can assess the emissions levels of plants in third countries, this can be a facilitating factor in the application of the mechanism. A carbon border mechanism would also offer a long-term signal to investors across the EU, thereby supporting the upscaling of low-carbon technologies; Last but not least, revenues generated by the carbon border adjustment could also be used to foster research and deployment of low-carbon technologies in Europe.\nHowever, these expected benefits will largely depend on the design of such carbon border mechanism.\n4\nCarbon border mechanism: design principles\nCEMBUREAU understands that the cement industry is considered as potential ‘pilot’ sector for carbon border mechanisms. As outlined above, we consider that carbon border mechanisms can play a key role towards decarbonisation; however, getting their design right is paramount. With this this in mind, CEMBUREAU has developed five key design principles for such instrument.\nUltimately, CEMBUREAU considers that the objective of any mechanism is that it should result in EU producers and third country importers paying the exact same price for the carbon emissions they emit.\nPrinciple 1: In an initial phase, an EU carbon border mechanism must be complementary to the EU ETS free allowances\nIn an initial phase corresponding to phase IV of the EU ETS (2021-2030), CEMBUREAU considers that the instrument should take the form of a carbon adjustment mechanism, and be complementary to the EU ETS. An adjustment charge should be applied to third country imports to ensure that importers face the same carbon price than EU producers under the ETS. This adjustment charge should be fair and take into account the free allowances received by the European industry.\nAs explained above, energy-intensive industries such as cement already face a shortfall of allowances under the ETS rules, increasing the production cost and the risk of production being offshored. In this context, the introduction of a cross border mechanism combined with an immediate loss of free allowances would create considerable uncertainty and risks.\nBesides, having a carbon border mechanism set up while maintaining free allowances for EU producers during an initial phase provides distinct advantages:\ne It would provide a stable framework for low-carbon investments to happen. The industry has taken the current EU ETS Directive (adopted in 2018) as a basis for long-term investment decisions, including for investments needed to decarbonise the sector in the coming years. This legal certainty would again be put into question by the introduction of a cross border mechanism which would, for EU producers, impact the free allowances system, before the expiry of EU ETS Phase IV; It allows the level of free allowances received by EU producers to be taken into account in the setting of the adjustment paid by importers; thereby starting with a smaller amount. This is ideal for a testing phase, given the many uncertainties surrounding the implementation of a carbon border mechanism (WTO compatibility, trade retaliations...); It minimises distortions of competition between different sectors which are covered by the EU ETS.\nFurthermore, it is important to underline that the existing system of free allowances was adopted in order to address one specific type of carbon leakage, namely the offshoring of a number of sensitive industries from the EU to countries with less stringent carbon costs. Addressing emissions in imports, which is also essential to prevent carbon leakage, is not tackled by the current ETS carbon leakage measures. This is why the two carbon leakage\npolicies — ETS designed with free allowances on the one hand, and a carbon border adjustment to reduce third countries’ emissions on the other hand — should be viewed as separate and evolve independently of each other, as opposed to being seen as “alternatives” to each other.\nCEMBUREAU believes it is perfectly possible to design a mechanism that takes into account the free allowances received by the European industry to determine a fair adjustment charge for importers. The adjustment paid by importers would simply be reduced to take into account free allocation, including the fact that free allocation would reduce over time (e.g. through a cross-sectoral reduction factor or to meet the new 2030 target).\nPrinciple 2: A carbon border mechanism must be based on verified emissions from importers to the EU, not ‘average emissions’. It should include indirect emissions.\nFor any mechanism to be successful and fair, it is important that it is based on actual and verified emissions. This is particularly crucial in the case of cement, where various types of cement with different carbon intensity can be produced.\nThird country producers’ emissions could be determined in a two-step mechanism:\ne Third country producers would use an EU-accredited certification body to determine the CO. content of their product; If a third country producer fails to produce such certified document, the COz content of their product would be based on a corrected average CO2 emission value for the clinker/cement produced in the exporting country, for instance taking the worst 20\" percentile. This would incentivise third country producers to be transparent on their emissions. Recognition would be made for third country CO2 emissions schemes and these would be factored in when determining the CO2 charge for imports from the third country.\nIn addition, the adjustment mechanism should also include costs associated with indirect emissions. The European cement industry is indeed exposed to significant indirect costs, which are foreseen to rise in the future (e.g. following the electrification of production processes and introduction of CCS). It is therefore fair that importers face the same costs.\nPrinciple 3: A carbon border mechanism must follow a very transparent methodology and be fully WTO-compatible\nTo create a predictable framework for low-carbon investments (new technologies, equipment and infrastructures), it is essential to have sufficient guarantees that the mechanism would not be retracted at an unexpected moment, for instance following a WTO ruling.\nThere is abundant literature available on the issue of carbon border mechanisms, which seems to indicate that it is perfectly possible to design a WTO-compatible instrument. As explained above, it is however important to keep free allowances during an initial phase, to ensure that the industry is not left unprotected should legal (or political) disputes arise.\nIn assessing WTO compatibility, specific attention needs to be paid to respecting the non- discrimination rule which is most likely to be respected when a “mirror-image” system to the EU ETS is designed for third country producers. In such case, however, it is important to determine from which source third country importers would buy allowances, i.e. from the EU ETS allowances volume or, as suggested in the discussions with the French Government, from a virtual volume of allowances.\nCEMBUREAU would also encourage the EU to discuss the design of a mechanism that would encourage third countries to adopt similar carbon reduction measures as to those applied to European producers. For such an approach, a recourse to the environment exception provided for under Article XX GATT may be required.\nPrinciple 4: An EU carbon border mechanism must be applicable to all sectors alike\nWe understand that the cement sector is considered as a potential ‘pilot sector’ for carbon border mechanisms. We think it is however important that as many sectors as possible are included — the principle should be that the carbon border mechanism will be applicable in the widest sense and should not seek to differentiate between sectors.\nIf amechanism is limited to only a few sectors or sub-sectors, it will inevitably create distortions of competition on the EU internal market. These market distortions would have a significant impact on downstream markets such as the construction sector. We therefore believe that a carbon border mechanism should apply to all the sectors covered by the EU ETS.\nPrinciple 5: A carbon border mechanism should provide for an CO2 charge exemption for EU exporters\nFinally, a carbon border mechanism should provide for a COz charge exemption for EU exporters to third countries, if the third country in question is not covered by a carbon pricing mechanism.\nAs the climate ambition of the EU increases, leading to an overall increase of COz2 costs, European cement plants will face increasing competitive disadvantage in relation to producers in third countries. This will result in lower access to export markets for the European industry, with a negative impact on global COz performance.\nThe carbon border mechanism should therefore include a COz charge exemption for exports of EU plants. This would act as a further incentive to ensure third countries set up carbon pricing schemes, with an international Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) in place. Such export rebate can be designed as compatible with WTO rules under the so-called destination principle which requires that operators exporting to a third country should be treated the same way as the domestic operators in that country.\nIn the long-term, other forms of mechanisms could be envisaged\nThe above principles focus on the creation of a carbon border adjustment mechanism running in parallel to the EU ETS in the coming years. We believe that such model would be the most practical and realistic, at least until the end of phase IV of the EU ETS in 2030.\nHowever, after this date, different forms of carbon border mechanisms could be envisaged. The mechanism could continue to run in parallel to the EU ETS, as described above. Alternatively, the creation of a COz2 consumption charge applied indistinctly to EU and non-EU products could also be envisaged. Such form of mechanism would present opportunities, but also has complex ramifications and impacts which should be analysed. CEMBUREAU stands ready to support this work in due course.\nPeer e ere eee rr rrerrrrrerrerrererrerrerrr rrr rerrr rr errr rrr rr rrr rr err errr rrr rrr rerrr rr errr rrr reer errr rrr rr rrr rrr rrr rr rrr rrr rr errr rt rrr errr rr rrr rrr rr rrr rrr rrr rr)\nThe European Cement Association based in Brussels is the representative organisation of the cement industry in Europe.

Given the expected potential higher climate ambition for 2030, we recognize that additional and improved carbon leakage provisions may be needed. However, we believe that alternative measures to the proposed CBAM-options in the IIA may have to be investigated and considered by the Commission in its upcoming impact assessment. We give our own list of required features of the possible CBAM.\nEU’s long-term objective is to reach climate neutrality by 2050. European Commission in its Green Deal states “should differences in level of ambition worldwide persist, as the EU increases its Climate ambition, the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors to reduce the risk of carbon leakage”. The Paris Agreement on climate includes a mechanism, where countries can increase their nationally determined contributions of reducing their GHG emissions. The next stock-taking meeting takes place in 2023.\nTechnology Industries of Finland considers that it is crucially important that EU climate policy has a long term view with clear targets so that the European industries will be able to plan and execute their respective investments across years 2020-2050. The right moment for setting the intermediate targets, such as 2040 target, would be the COP stock-taking meeting on 2023, not at the COP23 in Glasgow. At the same time the EU could consider, if it is necessary to adopt any new measures against carbon leakage, like carbon border adjustment mechanisms, to reinforce the already existing carbon leakage measures (e.g. ETS free allowances and compensation for indirect emissions trading costs).\nIf, however, adopting carbon border adjustment mechanism, or alike, were deemed necessary, they must be in line with the rules of international trade and the rules of World Trade Organisation.\nThe sectors that would be covered by the border adjustment mechanism should be limited to those that are currently regulated under the ETS as they are deemed to be exposed to the risk of carbon leakage e.g. steel and other energy intensive products.\nThe adjustment must be designed so that it only sets the carbon price for imported products at the same level as the corresponding products have in the EU, because of the ETS. Imported products shall not be discriminated and no protectionism shall occur.\nImporters of the relevant products shall be obliged to certify the carbon emissions or product environmental footprint of the product, taking into account both the direct and indirect GHG- emissions of the production. This certification must be verified by an independent third party, e.g. accredited inspection company.\nThe adjustment mechanism shall create a level playing field inside EU-market, but not outside. This is why it is necessary to maintain the existing rules for carbon leakage, free allowances and compensation of indirect costs, for European export companies. These measures must continue until up to 2030.\nTechnology Industries of Finland\nEtelaranta 10, P.O.Box 10, FI-00131 Helsinki\nTelephone +358 9 192 31\nwww.techind. fi\nBusiness ID: 0215289-2\n2 (3)\nIndirect costs are not compensated in all Member States. Furthermore, the level of compensation varies from country to country. This creates distortions in the EU single market that cannot be tolerated. In the connection of carbon border adjustment mechanism there should be a separate fund that collects the adjustment fees. This fund should be used to pay the compensation to products exported out from the EU-countries. The compensation should be the same for exports from all Member States and be based on the average EU wholesale electricity market marginal generation i.e. coal condensing power, carbon price pass through. The fund would establish a harmonised mechanism for the EU and shall rectify the distortions caused by different compensations of indirect costs in different Member States. Furthermore, there would be no need to use taxpayers’ money to pay the compensation.\nConclusions and recommendation:\nAs a conclusion the Technology Industries of Finland wants to emphasize that all of the proposed options by the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism have some advantages, but also some significant disadvantages. As our contribution to the development of the potential CBAM, the Finnish Technology Industries would like to offer its view on the basic mandatory principles to be incorporated to the possible system:\nIt is necessary that the system provides strong international incentives to decarbonise manufacturing conditions also in third countries, but in the first place the EU CBA should provide a level playing field with third country producers which are not subject to the same environmental constraints.\n1)\n2)\nAny CBA regime must be based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products. In other words, a product with a high carbon footprint must be taxed higher than a similar product with a lower carbon footprint.\n3)\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism must not replace any existing EU policy measures until the CBA is fully tested and developed:\ne An effective EU trade policy, including existing ordinary import duties and trade defense measures (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguards); Existing EU carbon leakage measures, i.e. ETS free allowances, until a CBA mechanism is fully in place and seen to be effective; Currently applied EU indirect cost compensation, to the extent the CBA mechanism does not effectively cover the entire supply chain, including energy inputs; EU regulatory relief foreseen in the State Aid Guidelines on Energy and Environment (EEAG).\n4)\nWhile the avoidance of additional administrative burdens is important, an effective CBA mechanism requires a legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products. The effectiveness of the mechanism will depend on the details of its design and its ability to adapt in the face of absorption and source shifting.\n5)\nThroughout the process of putting in place a comprehensive CBA mechanism, transparency and close dialogue with trading partners will be important.\n3 (3)\n5)\nHelena Soimakallio - Executive Director, Sustainable Development Technology Industries of Finland EU Transparency Register number: 39705603497-38\nTo be coherent with the objective of the CBA, and the EU climate policy objectives in general, funds raised from the CBA should be used primarily to encourage investments in carbon-reducing technologies using e.g. the Innovation Funds."

This will make it possible to:\n• To establish a level playing field and reduce carbon leakage\n• Valuing the ability of the industry to produce the green solutions of tomorrow in Europe\n• To increase the efficiency of the European emission allowance market by encouraging countries exporting to the European market to develop climate policies. \n\nThe following legal, economic and technical conditions must be taken into account:\n• To comply with WTO rules, with the single objective of ensuring the same level of environmental and climate requirements for all products consumed on the European market without a protectionist aim; \nMaintain key coherence with existing support mechanisms (maintenance of free ETS allowances and the indirect cost compensation scheme) as long as the effectiveness of the scheme is not proven. \n• Take into account the complexity of value chains (imports, exports, compensations for the importing sectors: Cement, steel, chemistry,...) and downstream exporters (aeronautics, chemicals, automobiles, etc.) and to ensure the competitiveness of exports to countries where the carbon constraint is less ambitious than in Europe, and to combat victimisation and circumvention;\n• Assigned revenue to finance the transition for exposed economic actors (businesses and households), compensation for additional costs and innovation;\n• Ensure a robust and auditable system of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), taking into account the carbon content of energy consumed and imports.\n\nThe MEDEF wishes to:\n— Contributing to experimentation, measuring its effectiveness in terms of reducing the carbon footprint and global emissions, assessing its impact on exports to third countries, and defining the accompanying measures and the conditions for its extension; \n— Contribute to its extension to other sectors and including final products. \n\nThe MEDEF considers that such a mechanism, which is necessary to restore the competitiveness of European technology leaders, must be accompanied by additional measures essential to achieving carbon neutrality: Maintain reliable and competitive access to energy and organise the financing of the investments that will be massive.\n\nFinally, the MEDEF recommends further climate approaches: \n• Search for convergence of climate policies through carbon prices, analyse the impact of these prices on trade,\n• Promoting climate standards in trade agreements\n• Establishing carbon clubs applying trade sanctions to third countries not respecting the Paris Agreement\n• Harmonise European tax systems (energy, VAT) on the basis of carbon content.  \n• Elargier the approach to all products consumed by working on the display of the carbon content of products.",

        "feedback": "APPLiA Bulgaria’s Views on the Carbon Border Adjustment Tax\n\nIn the frame of the EU climate strategy, the European Union will have the challenge of designing policy that will reduce CO2 emissions and encourage greener industry in Europe, while avoiding making European industry less competitive both in the internal market and on the world market. In avoiding carbon leakage, the EU must also avoid the “leakage” of the strength of European industry. It’s already a fact for some industries in Bulgaria who export their production facilities to third countries.\n \nA proposal has been made to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax for materials and/or products imported to the EU. The European Commission has suggested that applying a charge on imported goods based on the embedded carbon emitted (during production) would be a good way to avoid carbon leakage and to keep European companies competitive. However, it must be stressed that such a measure would have the exact opposite effect on the EU industry of finished goods, if a carbon tax were introduced only on raw materials such as steel, aluminum and plastics. If a carbon tax were only applied to imported raw materials, it would affect finished goods produced within the EU, but not outside it. This would make finished goods produced in Europe more expensive, and therefore less favourable for European consumers.\n \nThus, if a carbon adjustment import tax is introduced for raw materials, it must also be introduced for finished goods.\n\nImposing a tax on imported raw materials without extending it to finished goods would create a clear incentive for businesses to move their manufacturing plants outside the EU, both taking jobs and ultimately leading to an increase in carbon emissions (the very leakage that the border tax was designed to fight against). Furthermore, this tax would simply shift the problem of carbon leakage from the raw materials industry to the industry of finished goods without tackling the problem, while simultaneously damaging the European economy and leading to cases of cascading protectionism as seen since the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs in 2018.\n \nIn conclusion, the European Commission should be commended for its intentions in developing a greener economy that remains based in a system of free trade. However, the European Green Deal, by its nature, remains a continental response to a global problem. Imposing regulation that has an impact on European manufacturers must be considered in the context of the global economy for all industry sectors and not only for the industry of raw materials.\n\nAPPLiA Bulgaria represents the home appliance industry in Bulgaria. APPLiA Bulgaria supports global decarbonization efforts and thinks European industry is well-positioned to be a global leader in green technology. The needs and the resources of each Member State should be taken into a serious consideration.\n\n",

Large discrepancies between prices, introduced by strong gradients between local climate policies, ought to be put under control, quickly and effectively. The CBAM looks like the best way to achieve this. \nNow the CBAM should be implemented, eventually, to cover the full material flow, for example of steel. \nIndeed, steel, as a commodity material ,accounts for less than 60% of international trade, the rest being embedded in final consumption goods, like automobiles, mechanical equipment, etc. There are simple methods, based on simplified LCA, which can measure the carbon content of steel in an automotive or whatever else. \nIt should not be assumed that all foreign producers are doing worse than the European in terms of GHG emissions related to, say, steel. China in particular, has been improving its act very quickly and convincingly. \nAnyway, the major point of CBAM should be to make Climate mitigation practices more universal across the world: when this happens, the CBAM will end up not yielding much  money, which is its intended outcome. \nThis point is essential, as the CBAM could be seen, from outside the EU, as another example of \"Fortress Europe\" protecting its internal market, which it definitely is not or ought not to be!

        "feedback": "1.\tAims\nThe BA aims at making the EU ETS more effective for climate protection and avoiding or reducing existing and potential competitive disadvantages and carbon leakage. \n\n2.\tCoverage\nThe BA should apply to imports, not to exports. It imposes a charge equivalent to the EU ETS to imported products or services. \n\n3.\tSectors\nThe BA should first only cover one climate-intensive sector. If effective, it could be extended to further climate-intensive sectors. Aluminium, cement, or steel might be included first. Final products could also be considered as these are traded more. Of services, aviation might be included. \n\n4.\tCalculation \nThe BA on products could be calculated on the basis of the lowest product price imposed by the EU ETS. The price the most efficient EU installation paid for EU ETS certificates needs to be divided by its production volume of the same period to calculate the price per product. This price could be the benchmark for the BA for this type of product for the following commitment period. As climate-intensive goods, even if produced in the most climate-efficient way, have a certain minimum emission intensity, a price-based BA would be more effective than the EU ETS is today without the BA. Such BA would also not discriminate against imported products. Manipulation of data would be difficult. Data from abroad would be unnecessary. \n\nThe carbon footprint (CF) is not recommended as it is too discretionary. It is not clear which greenhouse gases it includes, whether it includes only the production process or the whole life cycle of a product. Emissions are not objectively verifiable in traded products. The measurement of the CF would be bureaucratic and costly. Furthermore, measuring the CF would require data from abroad which are not (always) available and doubted to be reliable. The CF is not free from the suspicion of discrimination.\n\n5.\tWTO rules\nTo avoid WTO disputes and trade conflicts, the strictest interpretation of WTO rules should be applied. The price-based approach suggested under (4.) is non-discriminatory according to the strict interpretation of non-discrimination rules of the WTO. To avoid discrimination, the BA should enter into force not before the EU ETS applies full auctioning.\n\n6.\tParis Agreement\nCooperative approaches under Article 6 Paris Agreement should be negotiated with all its Parties before establishing the BA and be regularly re-negotiated. Double-counting must be avoided (Article 6(2) Paris Agreement). If imported products or services have been charged by a carbon price in another country, the BA might be lowered for trading partners of this state if the foreign instrument is, at least, equivalent to the EU ETS. The EU can establish an exchange rate that partly lowers the BA if equivalence is only partly provided. \n\n7.\tAviation\nThe BA may extend to the aviation sector but only for the distance flown in EU airspace (avoiding violations of the Chicago Convention that all EU States are bound to) and only to the extent the emissions were not covered by Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). \n\n8.\tExemptions \nThe BA can include exemptions for traders from low emitting states and least developing countries but without making the BA ineffective. Re-routing of traded products and services must be avoided. If exemptions are made, they should depend on quantifiable parameters, preferably the human development index (HDI) and the emissions per capita.\n\n9.\tSanctions \nPenalty rates may not be higher than the costs for sanctions for like products or services falling under the EU ETS.\n\n10.\tRevenue \n100 per cent of the revenue from the BA should be used for the Green Climate Fund or another international climate fund under the Paris Agreement or the UNFCCC. \n\nUlrike Will, \"Climate Border Adjustments and WTO Law: Extending the EU Emissions Trading System to Imported Goods and Services\", Brill | Nijhoff, Leiden/Boston 2019, https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004391055 \n",

The introduction of a BCA would allow the EU to phase out current carbon leakage provisions of the ETS and to auction off all emission allowances, thus rendering the ETS a more effective unilateral tool to price and reduce carbon emissions. In theory a BCA would be a perfect instrument to ensure a level playing field for domestic and foreign producers, thus avoiding potential carbon leakage. Until now, however, the legal and administrative issues of implementation have been deemed too huge to overcome. We derive a WTO-compatible (full) border tax adjustment (BTA) design that could be implemented in the near future, and we estimate potential EU BCA and BTA revenues using a dynamic new Keynesian (DYNK) model. The BTA design of our choice would generate substantial and stable revenues that could be used as innovative sustainability-oriented own resource to finance the EU budget. We find that estimated revenues would suffice to finance between 5% and 7% of the EU’s expenditure in the coming Multiannual Financial Framework period 2021-2027 and up to 16% in the year 2050. This new revenue source would allow Member States to reduce their current contributions to the EU budget accordingly and would thus create space to cut other more distortionary taxes at the national level, enabling an EU-wide supranational sustainability- enhancing tax shift. Thus, a BTA could contribute to tackle both environmental and fiscal challenges currently facing the EU.\nKeywords: EU budget, sustainability-oriented taxation, border carbon adjustment, border tax adjustment, EU revenue system, EU own resources, emission trading system, carbon pricing\nJEL classification code: F02, F36, F47, F53, H23, H87\nWIFO\n1. Introduction!\nThe European Green Deal presented by the new President of the European Commission Ursula\nvon der Leyen in November 2019 (European Commission 2019) and agreed upon by almost\nall Member States in January 2020 has revitalised the debate about the usefulness of a border\ncarbon adjustment mechanism (BCA) for the EU: the Green Deal mentions both a reform that\nshould increase the effectiveness of the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) and the\nintroduction of a BCA mechanism as important measures to be further explored. Indeed, an in-\ndepth discussion of the implementation of a BCA for the EU ETS is promising because it may\noffer solutions to a variety of problems.\nIn a recent contribution, Jean Pisani-Ferry (2019) addresses the fundamental problem of bringing in line the EU’s free trade agenda, one of the very few exclusive competences of the EU, and the EU’s ambition to lead the way in the field of climate protection. Effective unilateral climate action is already challenging under the current EU 2030/2050 goals, but the new push to pursue even more ambitious goals by the new von der Leyen Commission within the proposed European Green Deal needs to solve the issue of carbon leakage first.\nCarbon leakage occurs when carbon emissions in third countries increase as a consequence of\nemission-reducing policies in a country or group of countries (Barker et al. 2007). Mehling et\nal. (2019) distinguish three channels of carbon leakage. First, the substitution of domestic\nproducts by goods produced in locations with no or lower carbon prices (strong carbon\nleakage”). Second, the relocation of investment to countries with no or lower carbon prices as\na consequence of reduced domestic rates of return due to carbon pricing (weak carbon leakage).\nAnd third, the increase of demand for fossil fuel in low or no carbon pricing countries caused\nby the reduction of domestic demand and the ensuing reduction of global fossil fuel prices. In\nthe current debate about the introduction of a BCA for the EU ETS, the first two channels,\nwhich can be characterised as a shift of (new) production to countries/regions with lower\nenvironmental standards, are more relevant because our proposed BCA design only concerns\nETS sectors, thus not affecting EU demand for fossil fuels for the transport and heating sector.\n1 We are indebted to Andrea Sutrich for careful research assistance, and to Angela Kopp! and Mathias Kirchner for valuable suggestions and comments on an earlier version of the paper. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 2014-2020, grant agreement No. FairTax 649439. ?\nFor the differentiation between strong and weak carbon leakage see also Davis and Caldeira (2010).\nWIFO\nThe existence of carbon leakage in all its forms, especially the effect carbon pricing may have on the rerouting of new investment, is a contentious issue in the literature because it is hard to determine empirically. For this reason, the question whether the EU’s carbon pricing mechanism, the EU ETS, was and is responsible for carbon leakage still remains to be answered. There is a body of literature demonstrating, based on model simulations, that unilateral carbon pricing leads to international carbon leakage (see, e.g., Bohringer et al. 2012; Fowlie, Reguant, and Ryan 2016; Fischer and Fox (20127). This expectation is corroborated by various recent econometric analyses. Aichele and Felbermayr (2015) conclude that the Kyoto Protocol was indeed responsible for carbon leakage. For the US, Casey et al. (2020) show that state-level carbon pricing reduces employment, output and profits in the regulated state and increases them in nearby states. Naegele and Zaklan (2017), on the other hand, do not find evidence for carbon leakage in European manufacturing induced by the EU ETS, thus corroborating the results of several earlier empirical ex post analyses*. However, this finding may be explained by the low or zero emission costs the EU ETS imposed on firms during the first decade of its operation. As Lowe (2019) points out, more stringent emission-reducing policies in the EU, as planned within the European Green Deal, may well lead to carbon leakage in the future.\nThe problem of the EU is that the more ambitious carbon reduction targets are the quicker will\nthe current ETS carbon leakage provisions run their course because the amount of ‘free’\nEuropean Emission Allowances (EUA) is reduced by the same annual reduction factor (at the\nmoment 2.2% for the 4\" trading period 2021-2030) as is the overall amount of EUA.\nGraph | depicts the EU’s (and the UK’s) overall emission reduction path till 2030. The 43%\nreduction in the ETS sectors and the 30% reduction in the non-ETS sectors are relative to the\n2005 emissions, so that combined the reduction will amount to 40% compared to the base year\n1990 (Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC, Regulation 2018/842 and Directive 2003/87EC).\nCurrently, the price for one allowance, 1.e. the right to emit one ton of carbon, amounts to about\n25 €. Because of the Market Stability Reserve> (MSR) that finally deals with the oversupply of\n3 See also the brief review of model-based simulations in Condon and Ignaciuk (2013) and Naegele and ex ante Zaklas (2017) and the references cited therein.\n4 See Naegele and Zaklan (2017) for brief review of these earlier studies. a\n5 The MSR is mechanism that a certain level of liquidity in the EUA market. This that the a ensures means current oversupply of allowances will be put into the MSR and will not be available for auctioning.

More ambitious 2030/2050 reduction\ntargets would imply an even larger annual reduction factor and thus even higher EUA prices\nFigure 1: Current EU carbon reduction path for the 4th trading period (2021-2030)\nSony 80,\nClon\nClo\n&\nNational ESD targets 2030\nNS.

Combined with the fact that the\nUnited States formally notified the United Nations that they will withdraw from the Paris\nclimate accord and that the same administration is continuously cutting back on\nenvironmental/emission standards, and considering that other big emitters of carbon are\nallowed to increase their carbon emissions until 2030, protecting European industry against\ncarbon leakage should be at the top of the Commission’s agenda.\nIn addition to the protection against carbon leakage, an EU BCA could also serve as an ideal\ngreen instrument to fund the EU budget. Brexit and the current efforts to initiate fundamental\nreforms within the EU (European Commission 2017a and 2017b) could have considerable\nimplications on how the post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period\nWIFO\n2021-2027 is funded. The new dynamics in the debate about future EU funding fuelled by the final report of the High Level Group on Own Resources (HLGOR 2016) as well as the European Commission’s reform proposals from May 2018 for the EU System of Own Resources (European Commission 2018a), both suggesting innovative ‘genuine’ own resources for the EU substituting a part of national contributions by Member States, should be used to also address some long-standing criticisms of EU finances such as the net position thinking embodied in every MFF. Schratzenstaller et al. (2017) introduce an innovative sustainability-oriented perspective for EU revenue reform, capturing the social, economic, environmental and cultural/institutional dimensions of sustainability. Hereby the basic idea is to increase sustainability within public finances at Member State and EU level by introducing such revenue sources, in particular taxes, at the EU level which cannot be implemented effectively at the national level (Hudetz et al. 2017). These revenue sources typically are either green taxes/levies or taxes on wealth, corporate profits, and financial transactions (Schratzenstaller and Krenek 2019). The revenues from these taxes or levies should be used to finance the EU budget, which would allow for reducing current Member States’ contributions to the EU budget, creating space for national governments to reduce other, less sustainability- oriented taxes such as high taxes on labour. EU funds resulting from such a supranational tax shift across Member State and EU level are more adequate to finance European public goods with a true (sustainability-oriented) European added value (Schratzenstaller 2017). The case for a BCA as an instrument to finance the EU budget is made in chapter 2.\nThe concept of BCA is not new; however, no country or region has yet introduced a BCA (Lowe, 2019). These tariff-like levies would be imposed on EU imports based on the carbon emissions associated with the respective products, thus levelling the playing field for goods produced within the EU under a rigorous ETS. The complexity of this instrument, however, and the fear of potential WTO disputes have so far discouraged European policy makers to pursue this avenue, although the tentative legal framework in the form of the preamble in the revised EU ETS directive (2009/29/EC) is already in place. Given the political reality and existing international trade law, designing a BCA ina way that the actual amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the production of imported goods can be priced adequately is a huge political and legal challenge. That is why in chapter 3 we discuss the relevant articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) one by one in order to eventually derive one of the very few options available to legally implement in the foreseeable future an EU BCA by\nWIFO\nsecuring its WTO compatibility. The aim here is not to outline an optimal BCA design but a\ndesign that actually can be implemented unilaterally within the existing framework of\ninternational trade law. Chapter 4 models this specific BCA design with a dynamic new\nKeynesian (DYNK) model in order to estimate potential revenues. Chapter 5 concludes.\nWIFO\n2. BCA as an element for a sustainability-oriented reform of the EU system of own resources\n2.1\nStrengths and weaknesses of the current EU system of own resource\nCurrently the EU system of own resources primarily rests on contributions from EU Member\nStates’ national budgets (see for a detailed description Schratzenstaller et al. 2016), with the\nbulk of revenues stemming from GNI- and VAT-based own resources representing, in\nprinciple, national contributions instead of ‘true’ own resources. As pointed out, for example,\nby Nufiez Ferrer (2008), Begg (2011), or the HLGOR (2016), this revenue system certainly has\nits advantages (Hudetz et al. 2017). It guarantees steady, predictable and reliable revenues and\na balanced budget. Ex ante at least, i.e. before the application of the various correction\nmechanisms, it provides for a ‘fair’ distribution of the financial burden across Member States.\nMoreover, national contributions respect the subsidiarity principle by leaving the decision on\nthe distribution of the financial burden among individual taxpayers to Member States (Lipatov\nand Weichenrieder 2016).\nHowever, various criticisms of the EU’s revenue system have been brought forward during the\nlast decades (Schratzenstaller et al. 2017). The EU system of own resources is being criticised\nfor its opaqueness and in-transparency, rendering it impossible for EU citizens to assess their\nindividual and their respective countries’ contributions to the EU budget as well as the\nconnection between EU revenues and expenditures (Schratzenstaller 2013; Fuest, Heinemann\nand Ungerer 2015). Other critics address the increasing dominance of direct contributions out\nof Member States’ national budgets within the EU’s overall revenues, which is continuously\ncurtailing the EU’s financial autonomy (European Commission 2011; Iozzo et al. 2008).\nMoreover, the application of various correction mechanisms impairs the fairness of the\ndistribution of the financial burden across Member States. Finally, the EU revenue system does\nnot contribute to core EU policies (Schratzenstaller 2013; European Commission 2011;\nHLGOR 2016; Schratzenstaller et al. 2017), such as sustainable growth and development as\nanchored in the Europe 2020 strategy, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015\nParis Climate Agreement, and the European Green Deal.\nThis lack of support of EU policies, which has been repeatedly stated also by the European\nCommission (e.g. European Commission 2011) and the European Parliament (e.g. European\nParliament 2017) as well as by the HLGOR (2016), is not only caused by the concrete design\nof the individual own resources as such. It also results from the perception of the VAT-based\nown resource (making up for 11.1 percent of EU revenues in 2018) and the GNI-based own\nWIFO\nresource (66.7 percent of EU revenues in 2018) as pure national contributions. Such a perception induces Member States to measure the benefits derived from the EU budget in terms of net financial contributions, i.e. as the balance of national contributions and transfers received from the EU budget, and to demand the maximisation of net benefits or at least the minimisation of net contributions from their respective country’s position instead of the maximisation of an added value from an overall EU perspective (Iozzo et al. 2008). The dispute between ‘net contributors’ and ‘net beneficiaries’ also goes along with increasing tensions between Member States regarding the size and structure of the EU budget (HLGOR 2016) and exerts downward pressure on its overall volume (Haug et al. 2011). This is reflected in the most recent two MFF for the periods 2007-2013 and 2014-2020, each one lower in volume than the preceding one, as well as in the current negotiations on the MFF 2021-2027. Thus, the current structure of the EU system of own resources can be seen as an obstacle to further European integration as well as to policies supporting a sustainable economy and generating EU added value (European Commission 2011). These shortcomings in the structure of EU revenues and expenditures form the general\nbackground against which innovative (tax-based) own resources — to replace current own\nresources within a fiscally neutral approach — have been discussed by some time now. The\nEuropean Commission as well as the European Parliament have been in favour of substituting\npart of current own resources with tax-based own resources; a position supported by the results\nof the High Level Group on Own Resources (2016). Also, the proposal issued by the European\nCommission for reforms of the EU system of own resources in May 2018 (European\nCommission 2018b) suggests the introduction of various innovative own resources.\n2.2 Sustainability-oriented tax-based own resources: a building block for financing European public goods and a supranational European tax shift\nIn the expanding field of ‘international/global public finance’®, the debate about innovative\nfinancing schemes and options for the provision of global/international public goods has been\nled for some time now. Somewhat surprisingly, the insights gained in this strand of the\nliterature are only slowly feeding into the debate about the future financing of the EU. This\nmay be explained by two specifics of EU finances in particular. First, national sovereignty in\ntax issues is fiercely defended by EU Member States, leaving only little space for EU\ncompetences in tax matters in the first place, which accordingly are defined rather narrowly in\n® See, for instance, the contributions in Atkinson (ed.) (2005) Kaul and Conceicao (eds.) (2006). or\n7\nWIFO\nthe EU treaties and require unanimous decisions of Member States to become effective at all.\nSecond, a large share of EU expenditures is not perceived as creating EU added value, but to\nserve national interests.\nIf — as following from the subsidiarity principle — EU revenues in the future should be used to\nprimarily finance true European public goods’, establishing a financing scheme at the EU level\nwhich is strongly resting on true own resources instead of pure national contributions appears\nto be a necessary precondition. Sustainability-oriented tax-based own resources could be\nestablished within the existing political, legal and institutional framework at EU level as the\nbasis for such an EU financing scheme (Schratzenstaller and Krenek 2019). These tax-based\nown resources could substitute for national contributions, providing Member States with fiscal\nspace to cut more harmful taxes at the national level, particularly the high taxes on labour. This\nwould allow a fiscally neutral tax shift enhancing sustainability-orientation of the EU’s as well\nas Member States’ revenues systems, thus yielding a double dividend for Member States.®\nObvious candidates for sustainability-oriented tax-based own resources as a core element of a\ntrue EU revenue system are taxes or tax-like levies which cannot be enforced effectively at the\nnational level mainly for two reasons.’ First, because tax bases and/or tax subjects are mobile\nso that in an un-coordinated setting tax rates are reduced step by step (‘race to the bottom’), or\ncertain taxes are not introduced in the first place (‘stuck to the bottom’; Weibust 2009). Second,\nbecause of transnational externalities, in which case national taxation would imply inefficiently\nlow tax rates (Jones, Keen and Strand 2012). Moreover, unilateral taxation may reduce the\npressure on other countries to tax the respective externalities themselves, as they can free ride\non the reduction of the taxed externality and at the same time enjoy a tax advantage increasing\ntheir competitiveness (Auerswald, Konrad and Thum 2011). The fact that revenues from taxes\nor levies on cross-border externalities are not clearly attributable to individual nation states\nsuggests assigning them to a supra-national budget (Keen, Parry and Strand 2012).\nClimate levies aiming at slowing down global warming are a prime example for such\ninnovative (tax-based) own resources. Options for ‘green’ own resources in the context of EU\nfinances, which are also addressed in the final report of the HLGOR (2016), are EU-wide\naviation taxes (Krenek and Schratzenstaller 2017), a carbon tax (Luptacik and Lupta¢ik 2017),\nor revenues connected to the EU ETS. In light of this reasoning, the proposal by the European\n7 See for elaboration of European public goods Fuest and Pisani-Ferry (2019). an\n8 See for this double dividend\nargument\nin the\ncontext\nof the implementation of\nenvironmental taxation Sandmo (2005).\n°\na system\nof global\nSee for this argumentation Boadway (2005) in the context of financing global public goods by global taxation.\n8\nWIFO\nCommission (2018b) to use a share of auctioning emission certificates as own resource for the\nEU budget may be justified for two reasons: First, these revenues stem from an EU-wide carbon\npricing system implemented at the EU level. Second, the base of these revenues are carbon\nemissions which are associated with considerable cross-border externalities. In the same vein,\nthe potential revenues from a BCA for the EU ETS should be assigned to the EU to finance its\nbudget.\nImplemented as own resource for the EU budget, a BCA for an EU ETS would yield a European\ntriple dividend. The first dividend consists of a contribution to European/global climate goals.\nAs a second dividend, Member States’ tax systems would be improved in terms of growth- and\nemployment-friendliness. Using the revenues of green own resources to provide European\npublic goods with a (sustainability-oriented) European added value would create a third\ndividend. Finally, dedicating a substantial share of EU expenditures to programmes that would\ncontribute to a European decarbonisation strategy as envisaged by the European Green Deal\nwould establish a visible connection between EU-wide green own resources and their use and\nwould thus strengthen their political acceptability (Grubb 2011).\nWIFO\n3. Deriving a WTO-compatible BCA design for the ETS\nWhen approaching the challenge to design a WTO-compatible BCA, it is useful to distinguish between the general rules that allow WTO member states and signatories of the GATT to introduce trade restricting measures on the one hand and exceptions to these rules on the other hand. The relevant general rules for the introduction of a BCA can be found in article I., IL., Ill., XI. and XVI. of the GATT. The article that might allow a member state to deviate from these general rules in the case of implementing a BCA is Article XX!°.\n3.1. Most favoured nation principle\nArticle I. of the GATT represents one of the two best known principles of the GATT, namely the ‘most favoured nation principle’ (MFN principle). It states that a country is not allowed to discriminate between imported products from different countries and/or producers if the products in question are considered as ‘like’ products, i.e. similar products. The debate of what constitutes the concept of ‘likeness’ ultimately produced 4 guiding principles: i.) characteristics of the product, ii.) end use of the product, 111.) how the respective product is qualified in the schedule of concessions of member states, and iv.) consumers’ tastes and habits, i.e. whether a product is attracting the ‘same’ consumers. Thus, ‘production method’ is not an established criterion to determine whether or not two products are ‘like’ products. If, for example, two cars at the border of the EU are ‘like products’ according to the four criteria mentioned above but differ in their carbon footprints as a result of different production methods, the EU is not allowed to discriminate between the two cars. Although there is important case law, e.g. US — Import Prohibition of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products (WT/DS58) that deals with requiring a specific production method for environmental reasons, its applicability for carbon footprints would not be easy even in the case of perfect information, i.e. knowing the exact carbon footprint of every product. It should be emphasised that a BCA design based on individual carbon footprints is not only doomed because of its impracticability. It would establish the ‘production method’ as the main criterion to discriminate between products in order to allow for different tax rates at the EU\nborder for products identical in terms of characteristics, but produced, e.g., with a different\ncarbon footprint. Such a radical approach of changing the MFN principle is not likely to\nsucceed.\n'0 See also Monjon and Quirion (2010, 2011).\nWIFO\n10\n3.2. Pacta sunt servanda\nEven if there is a theoretical BCA design that would somehow be admissible under article I.\nand even if there was a universally accepted method to calculate the carbon footprint of\nimported products, article II. would quickly put an end to any attempts that propose an EU\nBCA design that tries to levy higher tariffs on relative ‘dirty’ products, i.e. ‘like’ products\naccording to the four criteria mentioned above but with a bigger carbon footprint.\nArticle II(1) simply states the principle of pacta sunt servanda, i.e. existing laws that include\nthe national tariff schedules are to be respected. For most of the traded goods (classes of goods)\nthere are already agreements regarding tariff rates. It would be possible to lower tariff rates\nunilaterally, implying that these reduced rates have to be granted to all WTO member states\ndue to the MFN principle. Increasing tariff rates, however, is subject to negotiation and\nagreement between WTO members. Details on how the schedules can be changed can be found\nin article XXVIII. of the GATT.\n3.3. The way forward\nArticle II(2), however, is one of the few pathways that would allow to introduce a specific\nWTO-compatible BCA design. “Nothing in this Article shall prevent any contracting party\nfrom imposing at any time on the importation of any product a charge equivalent to an internal\ntax imposed consistently with the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article III. in respect of the like\ndomestic product or in respect of an article from which the imported product has been\nmanufactured or produced in whole or in part; [...]”\nThis angle of levying a tax or a tariff equivalent to the burden imposed on domestic producers,\nirrespective of the carbon content of the imported product, appears as the only viable pathway\nto introduce a WTO-compatible BCA.'! This approach has two prerequisites, namely a\ntransparent calculation of the tax base and a transparent tax rate. Both is not a trivial\nundertaking but most feasible when compared to other approaches. For the tax base the existing\ncarbon leakage benchmarks within the ETS would be the basis to establish a so-called EU best-\ntechnology standard. These benchmarks are in most cases already product-based. Undoubtedly\nthe calculation of these standards would have to undergo renewed scrutiny before becoming\nthe basis of a BCA, but this can be achieved in the very short term.\n'! See https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp _e/trade_climate_change_e.pdf, and Trachtman (2016), Mehling et al. (2019) and Bueb et al. (2017).\n11\nWIFO\nThe identification of an acceptable tax rate is definitely the most difficult part of the reform.\nMost recently Kemfert et al. (2019), with regard to the current carbon pricing debate in\nGermany, emphasise the importance of a stable, predictable CO2 path (mainly) within the ETS.\nFirms have to know beforehand what additional costs they will face in the future in order to\nplan and make the necessary (technological) adjustments and investments. A strongly volatile\nEUA price will have a negative impact on the technological transition of EU industries to less\ncarbon-intensive methods of production.\nThus, we suggest the introduction of a very narrow price corridor within the ETS of which at\nleast the lower bound can be used as a tax rate for imports. The already existing MSR makes\nthis additional reform step significantly easier to implement.\n3.4. National treatment principle\nThe second well-known principle is the ‘national treatment’ principle, i.e. article III. of the GATT. This article is also based on the concept of ‘likeness’. GATT parties have agreed to not discriminate between imported products and domestically produced ‘like’ products. This refers to domestic taxes and levies, but also regulations and implies that member states not only are not allowed to discriminate between two ‘like’ imported products but they are also not allowed to discriminate between one imported product once it has entered the country and a ‘like’ domestically produced product. Solving the problem through national tax schemes is therefore not an option if the regulator tries to tax the imported product differently than the domestic product by assuming a different carbon footprint. It would, however, be feasible to tax two ‘like’ products, one produced in the EU and one outside the EU, with the same tax rate, 1.e. irrespective of their carbon content. In this regard the Value Added Tax (VAT) is a good example how a future border tax adjustment could be put into practice. With reference to the Working Party Report on Border Tax Adjustments’? of 1970 the Interpretative Note of Article III? states that our proposed border tax design is admissible under the condition that it is product-based. Thus, the usage of the product-based benchmarks of the ETS is crucial.\n3.5. Unlikely success of integrating foreign producers into the ETS\nArticle XI. is relevant because it emphasises that among trade restrictions quantitative restrictions are to be avoided above all else. This means that every tariff is to be preferred over\n2 https://www.wto.org/gatt_docs/English/SULPDF/90840088.pdf.\n3 https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/gatt_ai_e/art3_e.pdf, pp.137-138.\nWIFO\n12\na quota. This is important because forcing foreign producers to participate in the EU ETS can be interpreted as a quantitative restriction and is therefore very unlikely to be WTO compatible. In 2009 due to political pressure the attempt to include foreign air travel providers into the ETS failed.'4 If this inclusion of foreign producers/providers would have been subject to the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO it is very likely that a panel would have deemed it not compatible with WTO rules, especially Article XI. of the GATT.\n3.6. Full carbon border adjustment\nArticle XVI. is relevant for the implementation of a full border carbon adjustment. In such a full border carbon adjustment, for every (ton of) product that is exported to countries outside the EU the respective producers would get their costs for buying allowances refunded or would not have to buy allowances in the first place. This process has to be as transparent as possible in order to not be classified as an export subsidy. It should be noted, however, that the wording of article XVI. is less strict than in other, more important articles, thus making it very likely that a full border carbon adjustment based on article II(2) is WTO compatible.\n3.7. Deviation from the general rules of the GATT\nFinally, under article XX. of the GATT there is the possibility to argue in front of a WTO panel that a specific BCA design is necessary, even though it violates the MFN, national treatment and/or pacta sunt servanda principle, in order to protect human and animal health and life or for the preservation of exhaustible natural resources. Proving this necessity might be possible and it should be mentioned that a WTO panel in US — Gasoline (WT/DS2) ruled that trade restricting policies that protect the natural and exhaustible resource, namely clean, air is permitted under XX(g). However, fulfilling all the requirements of article XX. is not as easy as it might seem because a two-tier analysis is necessary. Once the necessity of a measure (e.g. to protect human life) is established it has to be demonstrated that this measure is not applied in a manner which would constitute ‘a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail’ and is not ‘a disguised restriction on international trade 215 . Regarding this second tier, every BCA design that is not based on article II(2) would face the same difficulties as in complying with article I. and II. of the GATT. In the case that our proposed BCA design based on article II(2) is found to be not compatible with\n'4 See also Fouré (2016).\n'S See also https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp _e/trade_climate_change_e.pdf, p.100.\n13\nWIFO\nthe relevant general rules of the GATT (articles I., II., III., XI. and XVI.) it would still have the best chances to pass the two-tier test of Article XX.\n3.8. Border tax adjustment instead of border carbon adjustment\nUltimately, we do not propose a border carbon adjustment (BCA), but rather transforming the ETS into a quasi-carbon tax that would allow for the introduction of a simple EU border tax adjustment (BTA).\nThe tax base for the BTA has to be calculated based on the benchmarks already available in the EU ETS!®. These benchmarks might need new scrutiny, but they are already product-based and thus applicable for calculating a border tax adjustment. The second requirement is the introduction of a narrow EUA price corridor in order to use the lower bound of this corridor as a non-volatile tax rate. This has the additional advantage of ensuring predictability of the future price path for firms allowing them to prepare long-term plans and to make the necessary (technological) adjustments and investments, thus avoiding lock-in effects.\nIt is fully acknowledged that the approach put forward in this paper would abandon one of the key features of a BCA mechanism economists cherish the most, namely the incentives for foreign firms/countries to change their production methods. However, every attempt to implement a true BCA that discriminates either between importing countries or an importing country and the EU is doomed to fail. The proposed BTA design, in contrast, is likely to be considered compatible with the relevant general rules of the GATT (articles I, II., III., XI. and XVI.) and has in addition the best chances to pass the two tier test of Article XX., which would allow the EU to introduce it irrespective of the BTA’s compatibility with the general rules.\nFinally, if a BTA is the measure the EU decides upon to prevent carbon leakage it should aim\nfor a full border tax adjustment, i.e. exempting EU exports from any form of carbon pricing.\n'6 This is equivalent BCA that that the carbon intensity of foreign production is identical that of to a assumes to the most efficient production inside the EU.\nWIFO\n14\n4. Estimated revenues\n4.1. The model\nIn order to estimate potential revenues of the proposed BTA we employ a slightly modified\nversion of a specific DYNK (DYnamic New Keynesian) model which was developed and\ndescribed by Kratena and Sommer (2014). Their approach is a hybrid between an econometric\ninput-output (IO) and a CGE model and is characterised by the integration of rigidities and\ninstitutional frictions. In the long-run the model has similarities to a CGE model and explicitly\ndescribes an adjustment path towards a long-run equilibrium on the labour market. The term\n‘New Keynesian’ refers to the existence of a long-run full employment equilibrium, which will\nnot be reached in the short run due to institutional rigidities. These rigidities include liquidity\nconstraints for consumers (deviation from the permanent income hypothesis) and wage\nbargaining (deviation from the competitive labour market). The model describes the inter-\nlinkages between 59 industries (NACE rev. 1.1) as well as the consumption of 5 household\nincome groups by 47 consumption categories (COICOP) and covers the EU 27 (as one\neconomy). The model of household demand comprises three nests, where in the first nest the\ndemand for durable commodities (own houses, vehicles) and total nondurable commodities is\nderived from a buffer-stock model of consumption. The second nest links energy demand (in\nmonetary and physical units) to the durable stock (houses, vehicles, appliances), taking into\naccount the energy efficiencies of embodied carbon in the stocks. Direct CO2 emissions of\nhouseholds are derived from these energy flows. The third nest comprises non-energy and\nnon-durable commodities and is simulated by implementing an almost ideal demand system\n(AIDS) model with 8 commodity categories. The model of production links the input-output\nstructures (Leontief technologies) of 59 intermediary inputs to a production function with a\nTRANSLOG specification that has 5 factors (capital, labour, energy, domestic materials and\nimported materials) as inputs. This specification allows simulating endogenous shares of\nfactors in the production of each sector depending on relative prices and technological trends.\nThe factor energy is further split up into 26 types of energy, from which CO2 emissions of\nproduction are derived, a part of which constitutes the domestic indirect CO2 emissions due to\nhousehold consumption. The indirect CO2 emissions of imports are based on calculations of\nArto et al. (2014) using the world input output database (WIOD, Version 2013. The labour\nmarket is depicted via wage curves, where wage increases by industry depend on productivity,\nthe consumer price and the distance to full employment. The model is closed by endogenising\n15\nWIFO\nparts of public expenditure in order to meet the mid-term stability program for public finances in the EU27!’.\n4.2. Tax scenarios\nThe original version of our model was used by Kratena and Sommer (2014) to analyse the effects of two different EU27 carbon tax scenarios. One of these tax scenarios was a ‘classical’\ngreen tax reform, which taxes production-based GHG emissions on an increasing scale and\nuses revenues to reduce social security contributions, thus representing a revenue neutral tax\nshift. This scenario is now modified to also include the taxation of carbon embodied in imports.\nWe model both a classical BCA and our proposed BTA scenario as a tax on EU imports\ncombined with a classical carbon tax for all domestic sectors!®. The main difference between\nthe BCA and BTA scenario is the assumed carbon content of imported products. As we propose\nreforming the ETS into a quasi-carbon tax, which is then complemented by the introduction of\na BTA, this model is well suited for our purposes estimating potential BTA revenues and the\neffect a BTA has on economic growth and employment. The recycling of revenues to reduce\nsocial security contributions can be seen as national governments using the combined ETS and\nBTA revenues!’ to reduce domestic taxes on labour. The price path for all scenarios starts at €\n36 per tonne carbon emissions in 2018, increasing steadily to € 250° in 2050.\nIn contrast to our simple two country model, where one country represents the EU27 economy\nand the other one ‘the rest of the world’, a more elaborate global G-Cubed model was used by\nMcKibbin et al. (2017) to analyse the effects of a ‘carbon tax — BCA combination’ for the\nUnited States. The study offers several important findings. The most important insight in our\ncontext is that overall welfare losses expressed in GDP growth deviating from a baseline\nscenario are small in general, and even smaller if a carbon tax is combined with a BCA and\nrevenues are used to reduce other distortionary taxes. Using the revenues to reduce other\ndistortionary taxes is especially important with regard to employment. From a fiscal\nperspective the most important result is that revenues from a carbon tax-BCA combination are\nincreasing over time.”!\n'7 Croatia, which joined the EU July 1, 2013, is included. on not\n'8 The carbon for all domestic be interpreted national introducing carbon tax sectors can as governments a tax for the non-ETS sectors at the national level based on the same price path as in the ETS.\n'S Of for the simulation results it is irrelevant whether BTA directly recycled used course, revenues are or to finance the EU in a first step, reducing by the same amount member states GNI contributions and allowing them to reduce the taxes on labour/social security contributions in a second step.\n20 Real value; the price path is determined in line with the EU roadmap for low-carbon a economy. 71 See also Yuan al. 2017 for the long-term stability of carbon in general. et tax revenues\n16\nWIFO\nAs in McKibbin et al. (2017), and only for the sake of simplicity, our model does not consider\nexport rebates, i.e. exemptions from carbon taxation, for EU exports. Our prime focus lies on\nestimating potential revenues for the EU budget in the long run stemming from a WTO-\ncompatible BTA specification in order to demonstrate that a considerable share of the annual\nEU budget of about € 180 billion’” could be financed. A full BTA would of course lead to a\nsubstantial reduction of regular ETS revenues.\nWe simulate three scenarios: a BCA scenario and two BTA scenarios.\nScenario 1 (BCA) accounts for all direct and indirect carbon emissions embodied in EU\nimports. Tariffs are levied on EU imports and are determined based on the average sectoral\ncarbon content of non-EU countries. Although it is the most efficient BCA design, its\nimplementation as argued in chapter 3 is considered unlikely and is presented here only as a\nreference point for the WTO-compatible BTA scenario.\nScenario 2 (BTA) taxes only those imported products/inputs that are produced in sectors\nequivalent to ETS sectors, but this scenario assumes the same carbon intensity of production\nfor imported products as is prevalent in the EU. In line with Art II(2) of the GATT it taxes also\nthe relevant products if they are used as inputs for other products ,i.e. steel is also taxed if it is\nimported in form of a car. It should be noted, however, that EU energy producers are subject\nto the ETS and that EU manufacturers in many cases have their energy prices cut by the\ngovernment in order to protect competitiveness. France for example uses about 60% of ETS\nrevenues for indirect carbon cost compensation (European Commission 2018b). This scenario\nalso taxes indirect, energy-related carbon emissions (assuming the same carbon intensity as in\nthe EU). It would thus allow for a discontinuation of Member States’ rebates on electricity for\ntheir industries.\nScenario 3 (BTA realistic) is identical to Scenario 2 but excludes the taxation of electricity inputs of imported products. Thus, all imported products equivalent to those produced within the ETS, except electricity, are taxed directly and indirectly, assuming the same carbon intensity as within the EU. The intuition behind this scenario is straightforward. Even under the assumption of identical carbon intensity of production, the administration of taxing electricity inputs in every product seems unrealistic. Fortunately, electricity is almost exclusively imported indirectly via products, i.e. there is no direct competition between domestically produced electricity and electricity produced in third countries. If EU Member\n2 According the proposal forward by the European Commission in May 2018. to put\n17\nWIFO\nStates continue with carbon cost compensation, i.e. reducing the increasing cost of electricity\nfor their industries, excluding electricity inputs from a BTA would not harm competitiveness.\nThis is the BTA scenario with the best chances of implementation.\n4.3. Simulation results\nOur primary focus is to estimate potential long-term revenues of an EU BTA. Welfare effects\nof green tax shifts are in general ambiguous and certainly depend on the usage of revenues. If\nother harmful taxes are cut, as in some scenarios in McKibbin et al. (2017) and all three\nscenarios in our own model, almost no effect on GDP growth and even positive effects on the\nlabour market can be expected.\nBoth the results derived for the US by McKibbin et al. (2017) and our own results for the EU\nsuggest that revenues from BTA are not only substantial but increasing over time. BTAs ought\nto be introduced first and foremost to make domestic effective carbon pricing possible, which\nshould actually lead to a declining tax base. Why would revenues from a BTA still increase\nover time? Demand for imports is decreasing as prices are raised by our BCA and BTA\nscenario. This effect, however, only dampens the overall increasing trend of the share of\nimports in EU GDP. Accordingly, a BTA would only dampen the rate of imported emission\ngrowth. The major uncertainty with regard to revenues for a classic BCA is the future carbon\nintensity of foreign production. The overall trend of carbon intensity in production in non-EU\ncountries is decreasing and that this trend continues in the long 23 we assume run.\nIn all three scenarios potential revenues are substantial. Implementing a classical and most\nefficient BCA specification would generate enough revenues by 2027 to finance the current\nEU budget completely.”4 As mentioned above, however, this scenario should only be regarded\nas a reference scenario as its implementation is very unlikely. The share of the EU budget that\nour BTA (realistic) design would be able to finance starts with 5% in 2021 and increases to\n16% in 2050. This increase, as mentioned above, is caused by an overall increasing trend of\nthe share of imports in EU GDP but also an increasing carbon price path”».\n3 Examples like China, which after three of decline of carbon intensity of production, increased its years burning of coal since 2017again should emphasise that such an assumption can turn out to be wrong already in the short term.\n>4 For the sake of comparability, that the volume of the EU budget proposed by the European we assume Commission for the years 2021-2027 is increased annually from 2027 on by an inflation factor of 1.5%. 5 In 2050 the nominal price of carbon would be € 400, the real carbon price would be € 250.\nWIFO\n18\nFigure 2: Revenue potential of a border carbon adjustment\nBTA\nnominal\nBCA\nBTA\n(realistic)\ncarbon price\nrevenues*\nrevenues\nrevenues\npath**\n2015\n27\n8\n4\n22\n2016\n33\n9\n4\n26\n2017\n38\n11\n5\n31\n2018\n44\n13\n6\n36\n2019\n50\n15\n7\n41\n2020\n56\n16\n7\n46\n2021\n65\n19\n9\n54\n2022\n74\n22\n10\n61\n2023\n83\n25\n11\n69\n2024\n93\n27\n12\n77\n2025\n102\n30\n13\n86\n2026\n112\n33\n14\n94\n2027\n122\n36\n15\n103\n2028\n132\n39\n17\n112\n2029\n143\n43\n18\n121\n2030\n154\n46\n19\n130\n2031\n166\n50\n20\n141\n2032\n179\n53\n22\n152\n2033\n192\n57\n23\n163\n2034\n206\n61\n24\n174\n2035\n220\n65\n26\n186\n2036\n234\n70\n27\n197\n2037\n248\n209\nEU\nbudget***\n163\n155\n156\n160\n164\n169\n167\n177\n184\n191\n198\n209\n214\n217\n220\n224\n227\n231\n234\n238\n241\n245\n248\nBTA revenues BTA (realistic)\nin of EU revenues in %\n%\nbudget\nof EU budget\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n9\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n22\n23\n25\n10\n26\n10\n27\n11\n28\n11\n—_\n2041\n312\n261\n264\n2042\n330\n97\n36\n275\n268\n36\n13\n2043\n348\n103\n37\n290\n272\n38\n14\n2044\n367\n108\n39\n305\n276\n39\n14\n2045\n386\n113\n40\n320\n280\n40\n14\n2046\n405\n119\n42\n336\n284\n42\n15\n2047\n425\n124\n43\n351\n288\n43\n15\n2048\n446\n130\n45\n367\n293\n44\n15\n2049\n466\n135\n46\n384\n297\n46\n16\n2050\n487\n141\n48\n400\n301\n47\n16\nSource: own calculations. *bn €, **nominal values, *** 2028 to 2050: budget of 2027 according to the proposal by the European Commission from May 2018 kept constant, assuming a standard inflation rate of 1.5% annually\nIn addition to projected revenues shown in figure 3, figure 4 shows the effect of the BCA and\nBTA scenarios have on total EU employment.

Conclusions\nBy addressing both the issues of necessary reform of EU funding and the need for effective\nunilateral carbon pricing with the proposal to introduce a Border Tax Adjustment (BTA) for\nthe EU ETS we aim at contributing to the current discussion about the European Commission’s\nEuropean Green Deal. Compared to a classic BCA, our proposal of a BTA has the advantage\nof being WTO compatible and rather easily implementable in the near future. The main\ndifference between the two instruments is that a BCA tries to account for as much carbon of\nimported products as possible whereas a BTA only tries to levy exactly the same financial\nburden on foreign producers as on domestic ones subject to the EU ETS. In order for a BTA to\nbe successful the ETS would have to be transformed into a product-based quasi-carbon tax.\nThe already existing ETS benchmarks currently used for the distribution of free allowances\ncould serve for determining the BTA tax base as well as the amount of allowances a domestic\nproducer has to buy inside the ETS. As non-volatile tax rate we propose the introduction of a\nvery narrow price corridor within the ETS. The already existing market stability reserve (MSR)\nwill make the introduction of such a price corridor easier if the EU should pursue such a reform.\nSuch a price corridor has the additional advantage of ensuring predictability of the future price\npath for firms, allowing them to prepare long-term plans and to make the necessary\n(technological) adjustments and investments, thus avoiding lock-in effects. Finally, we come\nto the conclusion that a BTA would be a perfect instrument to fund the EU budget. It could not\nbe implemented by individual Member States. Its tariff-like characteristics makes it clearly a\ncandidate for a new sustainability-oriented own resource. Its base are carbon emissions, i.e. the\ntextbook example of a cross border externality, and its revenues are difficult to attribute to\nindividual Member States.\nBy employing a DYNK (DYnamic New Keynesian) model, which is a hybrid between an\neconometric input-output (IO) and a CGE model, we are able to simulate our proposed BTA\ndesign and estimate its long run potential revenues and its effect on economic growth and\nemployment. The model is recycling the revenues from the ETS as well as the BTA to lower\nsocial security contributions. This is of course equivalent to a scenario in which a BTA would\nfund parts of the EU budget, allowing Member States to lower their national contributions\naccordingly and to use their freed-up contributions to reduce more harmful taxes on labour in\nthe form of social security contributions. Our model predicts that there would be de facto no\neffects on economic growth and an even slightly positive effect on EU employment. A\nrealistically designed BTA could finance up to 7% of the 2021-2027 MFF proposed by the\n21\nWIFO\nEuropean Commission. If the budget of the year 2027 were to stay constant in real terms till\nthe year 2050 the proposed BTA design would be able to finance it up to 16%.\nReferences\nAichele, Rahel and Felbermayr, Gabriel. 2015.

        "pdf_text": "MYTILINEOS\nTo:\nEuropean Commission,\n1049 Bruxelles/Brussel\nBELGIQUE/BELGIE\nMarousi, April 1t, 2020\nMytilineos is one of the largest industrial companies in Greece, with activities in numerous sectors (including Metallurgy, Electricity generation and supply, Gas trading, and EPC works). One of our key lines of business concerns the operation of the largest vertically integrated alumina/aluminium production facility in Europe, where roughly 185,000 tonnes of primary aluminium are produced annually. The company is also making significant strides in the field of aluminium recycling, having recently completed the takeover of ‘EPALME’, the largest independent producer of secondary (recycled) aluminium in Greece. This enables Mytilineos to produce another 11,000 tonnes of recycled aluminium each year, with plans to further scale up the production capacity so as to reach 50,000 tonnes by the year 2022.\nAs acknowledged in the consultant’s report that accompanied the Commission’s recent proposal for the update of the EU ETS State Aid Guidelines, aluminium is one of the sectors (if not the sector) with the highest exposure to the risk of carbon leakage. The primary aluminium production process is fully electrified, and electricity costs tend to account for over 40% of total production costs. Therefore, primary aluminium producers are particularly exposed to indirect EU ETS costs (i.e. carbon costs passed on to consumers through electricity prices). This reality is compounded by the fact that aluminium prices are set in global markets (most notably the London Metal Exchange), meaning that cost increases cannot be passed on to consumers without losing significant market share to producers outside Europe, who do not face the same costs.\nAs a result, carbon leakage in the aluminium sector is already happening. Europe’s aluminium industry is committed to decarbonisation (the carbon intensity of primary aluminium\nT https: ec.europa.eu/competition/consultations/2020 ets stateaid uidelines/index_en.html\n?

The carbon footprint of producing primary aluminium in China is, on average, three times higher than the equivalent footprint of producing the same metal in Europe?. While the EU has lost 36% of its primary smelting capacity since 2008 (due to plant closures and curtailments), China’s share of the global market has risen rapidly, from just over 10% in 2000 to almost 60% today*. Although global demand for aluminium is increasing, investment in new capacity aimed at covering this new demand is happening in other parts of the world instead of the EU (investment leakage). As correctly noted by the Commission in the Inception Impact Assessment for the CBAM, as long as this situation persists, “there will be no reduction in global emissions, and this will frustrate the efforts of the EU and its industries to meet the global climate objectives of the Paris Agreement”. Of course, if the EU ends up further increasing its 2030 GHG reduction target to 50-55%, then the reality of carbon leakage will be exacerbated, and it will be even more important for the EU to enhance its carbon leakage measures.\nIn light of the above, we are pleased that both the Green Deal Communication and the Inception Impact Assessment for the CBAM acknowledge the problem of carbon leakage, and that the Commission is proposing a new measure aimed at tackling it (i.e. the CBAM). However, we have serious reservations about whether a CBAM is the most suitable measure for addressing carbon leakage, especially if it is considered an “alternative” to the existing measures. Although the current carbon leakage measures (and especially indirect cost compensation) are still in need of improvement, they offered a crucial minimum level of protection over the course of Phase III of the EU ETS, and therefore replacing them could lead to absolutely catastrophic consequences for Europe’s energy-intensive industry.\nThe main problem relates to if and how a CBAM could be applied to sectors characterised by a high level of electrification (e.g. aluminium). This is likely to become a problem for more and more sectors in the future, given that the Commission’s 2050 Long-Term Strategy stresses the importance of electrifying as many industrial processes as possible if we are to have any chance of reaching climate neutrality. While it may be possible to estimate the Scope 1 emissions that are directly attributable to an imported product with a reasonable degree of accuracy (e.g. by using benchmarks, though this might also pose challenges and risks of circumvention), it is unclear how the indirect footprint (i.e. the carbon content of the consumed electricity) could be estimated. Furthermore, in order to effectively guard against the threat of carbon leakage, indirect carbon costs are actually far more important than the indirect carbon emissions attributable to the imported product. This is because indirect costs and indirect emissions are not directly correlated, due to marginal pricing in European power markets. Electricity prices are set by a marginal unit, which tends to be a thermal power plant that faces significant carbon costs. Therefore, all electricity prices in Europe contain an implicit carbon cost (as set by the marginal unit), regardless of the actual carbon footprint of the consumed electricity. As a result, even zero-carbon electricity contains an implicit carbon cost, and this fact was recognised by the Commission in its recent proposal for the update of the EU ETS State Aid Guidelines. Thus, a CBAM based on the indirect emissions attributable to an imported product would not be capable of effectively guarding against\n3 European Aluminium, 2019. Vision 2050; European Aluminium’s Contribution to the EU’s Mid-Century Low-Carbon Roadmap.\n4 World Aluminium, 2020. Primary Aluminium Production.\ncarbon leakage, which is the result of indirect costs rather than indirect emissions. If a CBAM is not capable of creating a level playing field with regard to indirect costs (which is highly doubtful, given the massive difference in the design and functioning of power markets in third countries), then it cannot guard against the risk of carbon leakage, and therefore the current system of indirect cost compensation would simply have to be maintained.\nFurthermore, in order to avoid the creation of serious distortions along the aluminium value chain (including incentives to move primary production outside Europe), a CBAM would necessarily have to cover every product, from primary aluminium right down to final products that contain aluminium. This would be a logistical nightmare, particularly implementing robust rules that are capable of safeguarding against any possible circumvention of the CBAM.\nIn relation to the above point, any CBAM would necessarily have to be accompanied by a rigid system for calculating the carbon content of imported products, in order to prevent third- country exporters from ‘carbon re-branding’ (thereby essentially bypassing the CBAM and completely undermining its effectiveness). For example, 90% of Chinese primary aluminium production is based on coal-fired electricity generation, whereas the remaining 10% is based on hydropower. Therefore, without a robust disclosure system, a Chinese exporter could simply declare that its aluminium was produced using hydropower (even if this isn’t true), in order to bypass the CBAM. Third countries would be incentivized to re-route all their ‘cleaner’ production to Europe (displacing European production), while continuing to cover demand across the rest of the world using carbon-intensive production. This would actually lead to an increase in global emissions, i.e. carbon leakage (the very issue that the CBAM is meant to address!).\nThird, while a CBAM could potentially be a useful tool for creating a level playing field within Europe, it is questioned how the measure could ensure the competitiveness of European exports®. The EU-28 exported €1.96 trillion worth of goods in 20187. Although not all of these exports relate to ETS sectors, it is clear that jeopardising the competitiveness of European exports would bring about untold economic harm for both European businesses and Europe as a whole. One way to solve this problem would be to offer some form of rebate to European exporters; however, it is unclear whether such a solution would be compatible with WTO rules (and especially Art. 20 GATT). WTO-compliance must be ensured at any cost, due to the disastrous consequences that a successful third-country WTO appeal would have for the European economy and -more generally- for investor certainty in Europe. Of course, even if the CBAM is fully WTO compliant, other major economies may still decide to implement retaliatory measures against European exports, and this threat should be fully assessed before implementing a CBAM. Trade wars rarely result in a winner on either side, whereas protectionist measures usually have a negative effect on the market implementing them®.\nTherefore, before implementing any CBAM, it is absolutely crucial to ensure that all of the above issues have been resolved, and that the CBAM has been proven to work at least as well (if not better) than the current carbon leakage measures. Introducing a new “system”, replacing\n5 http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminium-smelting-power-consumption/ 5 explicitly mentioned in the inception impact “A carbon border adjustment would apply imports into As assessment, measure to the EU”.\n7 Eurostat, 2020.

Moreover, it should ensure smooth implementation within the EU but also member-states, taking into consideration that existing carbon leakage measures have matured over-time and -though not perfect- significant improvements have been achieved, boosting the efficiency of the ETS system as the flagship tool of the EU in its climate efforts. This may require some form of overlap period (where both the CBAM and the current measures are applied), in order to ensure that the CBAM ‘matures’ and is actually capable of working as intended.

Otherwise, the EU’s “importance” in determining global climate policies will be compromised, a fact which will have dramatic adverse effects on global emission reduction.\nYours sincerely,\nFor MYTILINEOS S.A.\nNick Keramidas\nEU & Regulatory Affairs Director"

It will also leverage the decarbonisation potential of Europe’s existing energy infrastructure, and in doing so, minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers, meeting ‘Just Transition’ objectives.\n\nHaving reviewed the Roadmap, GNI makes the following observations: \n\n1.\t‘Growth strategy impacts on innovation and research – opportunity for growth of green technologies\nGNI fully supports the ambition of the European Green Deal to “transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society…with a competitive economy”, an economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and not threatened by carbon leakage.  GNI acknowledges this growth strategy and notes that green technologies proven to contribute to decarbonisation goals also represent positive opportunities:\n\n•\tRenewable biomethane, which is net zero carbon and fully compatible with the existing gas networks, represents the least cost and least disruptive way to decarbonise home heating. \n•\tFor the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a necessity.  CCS with Bioenergy has the potential to deliver negative emissions.\n•\tIn the longer term, hydrogen will play a major role in the EU’s energy mix. Renewable hydrogen can be produced using Power to Gas technology that utilises excess renewable electricity. Hydrogen can also be produced from Natural Gas, and when combined with CCS technology decarbonised hydrogen can be produced. \n\n2.\tPrioritising a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy\nDelivering a carbon adjustment will make it more expensive to import carbon-intensive products and thereby potentially impact on a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy. With the Green Deal emphasising the need for a just and socially balanced transition, GNI supports the view that:\n\n•\tGases such as natural gas, biomethane and hydrogen should remain part of the energy mix and will help protect downstream jobs in energy-intensive industries. \n•\tLeast cost and least disruptive technologies are deployed, with electrification, natural gas with CCS, renewable gases and renewable electricity all set to play significant roles in the 2050 energy system. \n•\tSeveral studies have shown that renewable and decarbonised gas provide the least disruptive way of decarbonising heating across the EU.  \n•\tLeveraging the decarbonisation potential within Europe’s existing energy infrastructure will also minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers.  \n\n3.\tWorking in Partnership - Incentivising trade partners towards climate ambition\nThe EU Green Deal identifies the importance of “partnerships with industry and Member States” and the European Commission proposes to work strategically with sector partners to raise global ambition in respect of climate. Incentivising trade partners to decarbonise through the border adjustment will have an impact on global CO2 emissions. It may also provide the platform for the EU to become a leader in key technologies which enable the development of hydrogen, including the electrolysers needed to produce Green Hydrogen.\nEurope is home to energy intensive industries, including the chemical and steel sectors, which have intensive energy and heat requirements in their production processes.  GNI proposes that revenues recouped as a result of the carbon border re-adjustment are ring-fenced and reinvested in technologies, such as CCS and hydrogen, which will help decarbonise these industries. Policy and fiscal support for sectors already on a positive 2050 trajectory is also valid and will assist in the development and commercialisation of new energy technologies, ensuring their competiveness. \n",

While the main political driver is to design and implement a wide range of new legislative proposals to make Europe the first carbon neutral economy in 2050, the interplay of the existing legislation and the ambitious pace required to decarbonise will have a tremendous impact on all the economic actors of the Union. Should the agreement of the European Council to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% in 2030 be confirmed by the Climate Law to be unveiled by the European Commission, the EU as a bloc will have to make the most dramatic and fastest GHG emissions reduction by any major economy ever.\nIn other words, this new regulatory era will need to define clear policy pathways for industry to cope with the already ambitious Clean Energy Package and the ETS Phase IV reform (2021-2030) adopted in the previous term. Currently, these regulatory frameworks are already shaping the evolution of carbon markets, the future penetration of renewables, the functioning of the electricity and gas markets, the EU energy governance and, ultimately, the potential of electrification in decarbonising the economy.\nEUROALLIAGES is also aware of the potential transformation that the ETS system may undergo in the long run (post-2030) and the challenges that an evolving system with decreasing free allowances may pose to effectively protect electro-intensive industries from carbon leakage.\nWe therefore believe that the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) should be assessed within this particular regulatory context and tested in some sectors before a EU-wide implementation is considered. Any new mechanism with the complexity of the CBAM, will inherently influence the behaviours of the economic actors operating in the integrated value chains of our economy.\nThis is the reason why EUROALLIAGES calls for a serious multi-dimensional assessment that includes not only energy and climate angles but also fundamental aspects of EU’s trade and single market instruments and goals.\n2. Our major concerns\nThe implications of any type of CBAM design are multiple and somewhat difficult to predict with accuracy. However, there is a number of expected challenges related to energy, trade and single market policy areas that require further European Commission’s efforts in conducting a robust ex-ante impact assessment together with a debate with stakeholders.\nAmong the main challenges identified by our industry, we would like to stress the following concerns:\na) Any CBAM should not be designed to replace the current ETS carbon leakage architecture and regime at least before 2030\nWe believe that the carbon leakage regime featured by the current ETS Directive (Phase 4) should remain the central mechanism to regulate this particular challenge and provide the most effective carbon\nFuro\nIN LLIAGES\nComite DE LIAISON DES INDUSTRIES DE FERRO-ALLIAGES\nleakage protection for electro-intensive industries like ours until 2030. The introduction of a CBAM should not interfere or phase out the existing carbon leakage measures, as wrongly recommended by the EU Green Deal Communication published in December 20191, most notably; the allocation of free allowances for direct costs and the regulatory options provided in the State Aid rules for ETS indirect carbon compensation. These well-established mechanisms, effectively designed to provide very accurate and targeted carbon leakage mitigation over the last trading periods, should remain the backbone to enhance a better level playing field vis-a-vis third countries without cap-and-trade systems and, ultimately, prevent further carbon leakage of the EU’s most exposed strategic industries.\nb) Understanding the impacts in our sector’s value chain is critical\nEUROALLIAGES calls for a detailed assessment of the specificities of our sector's value chain. More specifically, this refers to upstream and downstream segments of the value chain, i.e. from the primary product down to the final product in the value chain. Inadequate schemes’ designs or inappropriate impact assessments can lead to potential negative impacts on the competitiveness of our industry. More specifically, we note with concern a very likely risk which would be the disruption of our value chain as an inadequate implementation of a carbon tax may artificially encourage imports of secondary products of integrated value chains in Europe that may end up by penalising other vital parts of the chain (i.e. upstream) . The assessment of any CBAM should always consider the global (and not fragmented) dynamics of strategic value chains.\nc) CBAM may have unintended effects on EU’s trade defence instruments\nEUROALLIAGES notes with concerns the potential unintended impacts (or regulatory loopholes) that a CBAM may have on the effectiveness of EU trade defence measures. For instance, the very recent introduction of environmental costs in some of the calculations in anti-dumping cases may collide or overlap with the imposition of a carbon adjustment against producers in third countries. This may lead to a potential “double-taxation” regime that may not only be challenged by third countries but also undermine the current system. We therefore call the European Commission to further explore and, if possible, clarify both the interaction and complex interlink between different types of CBAM designs/scenarios and the adequate implementation of the different EU trade defence instruments.\nd) CBAM should be compliant with the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) rules\nWe recommend any CBAM to be WTO compliant. The introduction of a CBAM without a clear green light from the WTO would most probably trigger a wave of WTO complaints against the EU by third countries. If the EU were to lose such disputes, what would follow would either be the EU amending its CBAM or WTO authorising retaliation against the EU. Those scenarios should be taken into account in\n' We firmly to the EU’s Green Deal Communication paragraph in 5 which states what follows “Should oppose page : differences in levels of ambition worldwide persist, as the EU increases its climate ambition, the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism, for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage [...] It would be an alternative to the measures that address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU’s Emissions Trading System”. The footnote number 10 in the same page defines “measures” as free allocation of emission allowances or compensation for the increase in electricity costs.\nure\nNX LLIAGES\nComite DE LIAISON DES INDUSTRIES DE FERRO-ALLIAGES\nthe Commission’s upcoming impact assessment work, which should include a sensitivity analysis of COQ2 prices based on the impact of a CBAM and the evolution of the carbon price.\ne) Testing a CBAM for some selected sectors should be temporary\nThe introduction of any potential CBAM for few sectors — as it seems to be intended - could probably be the most pragmatic policy option to test the system and, ideally, optimise its design. EJUROALLIAGES believes that any theoretically well-functioning CBAM for few sectors may level the playing field with third countries but, at the same time, may also create unfair market conditions for sectors that will not benefit from the scheme in the EU single market. It is necessary therefore to investigate in depth the impact on the few “trial” sectors, how rapidly can be expanded CBAM to other sectors with their respective specificities and consider compensation mechanisms for sectors that will lack ETS and CBAM protection together.\nf) Defining a workable and accepted carbon content methodology for products\nOne of the most serious challenges that any CBAM will face is to define the carbon content from third countries’ products imported into the EU? including both direct and indirect emissions. As one of the most electro-intensive industries, EUROALLIAGES stresses with concern that any system assessing the real carbon content of imported products may create certification/regulatory loopholes where fake green products are imported without a carbon adjustment and out-compete the EU domestic production. Moreover, there is no global system today for assessing the carbon content of imported products and the discussion in the EU to define carbon footprint based on life cycle analysis is far from over.\nIn addition to this, we believe that the European Commission should seriously consider a “reverse CBAM’” for products — manufactured in a responsible way — and exported outside the EU. Such support should also be assessed against the WTO legal framework before it is launched by the EU.\nThis relatively technical discussion can quickly become a political issue between the EU and its trading partners. EJROALLIAGES therefore recalls that only a simple, transparent, fair and workable approach to calculate direct and indirect CO2 content for products may provide a sound basis to launch a CBAM system but this approach should first be fully tested and endorsed in the EU before it applies to third countries.\n3.

        "feedback": "In rolling out the EU climate strategy, the European Union will have the challenge of designing policy that will reduce CO2 emissions and encourage greener industry in Europe,while avoiding making European industry less competitive both in the internal market and on the world market. In avoiding carbon leakage, the EU must also avoid the “leakage” of the strength of European industry.\n \nA  proposal has been made to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax for materials and/or products imported to the EU. The European Commission has suggested that applying a charge on imported goods based on the embedded carbon emitted (during production) would be a good way to avoid carbon leakage and to keep European companies competitive. However, it must be stressed that such a measure would have the exact opposite effect on the EU industry of finished goods, if a carbon tax were introduced only on raw materials such as steel, aluminum and plastics. If a carbon tax were only applied to imported raw materials, it would affect finished goods produced within the EU, but not outside it. This would make finished goods produced in Europe more expensive, and therefore less favourable for European consumers.\n \nThus, if a carbon adjustment import tax is introduced for raw materials, it must also be introduced for finished goods.\n\nImposing a tax on imported raw materials without extending it to finished goods would create a clear incentive for businesses to move their manufacturing plants outside the EU, both taking jobs and ultimately leading to an increase in carbon emissions (the very leakage that the border tax was designed to fight against). Furthermore, this tax would simply shift the problem of carbon leakage from the raw materials industry to the industry of finished goods without tackling the problem, while simultaneously damaging the European economy and leading to cases of cascading protectionism as seen since the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs in 2018.\n \nIn conclusion, the European Commission should be commended for its intentions in developing a greener economy that remains based in a system of free trade. However, the European Green Deal, by its nature, remains a continental response to a global problem. Imposing regulation that has an impact on European manufacturers must be considered in the context of the global economy for all industry sectors and not only for the industry of raw materials.\n\nThe home appliance industry in Europe alone employs over 920,000 direct and indirect workers and includes over 3,000 enterprises.

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Increased protectionism worldwide\nThird countries’ trade restrictions have increased since the imposition of the EU definitive safeguard measures, increasing the risk of trade diversion to the weakened European market\na Threats of the U.S. President to double again the 25% tariff on Turkish steel imports illustrates the extreme volatility in the implementation of the Section 232 policy on\nThe European Steel Association\n11\nsteel — and the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy (which is itself a source of deflection). Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

        "pdf_text": "Lorganisation mondiale des entreprises\nMarch 30th, 2020\nConsultation on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\nAnswer to the public consultation\nICC France is one of the 90 National Committees belonging to the International Chamber of Commerce\nICC France is one of the oldest and most active ICC NCs thanks to the commitment, experience and expertise of its 150 members (large companies, banks, law firms and trade associations).\nAligning trade and climate policy is one of our core objectives so as to combat the climate crisis and to reinvigorate the multilateral trading system which is currently weakened.\nIn 2019, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) organised in New-York, Paris and Madrid a series of consultations bringing together high-level business leaders, policy-makers, scholars and economists on 4 different potential alignment tools:\nClimate waiver, Carbon clubs, Carbon Border Adjustment measures, Carbon pricing.\nThe consultation on Carbon Border Adjustment Measures took place in Paris in November 2019 and was moderated by Mr Rodolfo Lacy, Director of the Environment Directorate for OECD.\nWe would like to share the lessons that can be learned as part of this consultation.\n1/ Advantages of a CBA\nSuch a mechanism which could take several shapes: taxes, mirror-ETS, standards, will shield EU energy-intensives companies (steel, cement for example) from cheaper imports coming from third countries with none or with weaker climate policy (no carbon market, no carbon pricing). This adjustment will re-establish a “level playing field” between EU companies and third country companies that could, for instance, take the form of a levy on imported goods, based on average prices in the EU’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Such mechanisms will stop carbon leakages and avoid the race to the bottom for energy-intensive industries while protecting the competitiveness of EU industries and reducing the competitiveness of cheap carbon-intensive imports. Because the EU represents 10% of global GHGs, such a mechanism could also send a positive signal to like-minded countries trading with the EU (Canada, UK, Switzerland) that will benefit from a kind of mutual recognition of their own ETS and exonerate their domestic companies to pay any levy on their exports to the EU27. In doing so, the EU will ensure coherence between its internal and external commitments and improve its climate policy with the revision of the Energy directive in order to meet the challenges to reduce GHGs by 50-55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.\nLorganisation mondiale des entreprises\n2/ Disadvantages of CBA\nThe use of carbon border measures could invite retaliation from other countries like China or the USA. In WTO, during the process of assessment of the EU Trade Policy, some US officials already showed their concern about any EU carbon border measures. This threat must be taken seriously in a context of global economic downturn linked to the Covid 19 crisis. The cost of some imported raw material from third countries having a poor climate policy will be more expensive for their EU buyers. That means that the price competitiveness of some EU large manufacturing industries that process these raw materials could be less (automotive industry, construction industry). That means also that the EU exports of these industrial goods may be affected. We understand that these potential carbon border measures would be an alternative to the current measures that address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU’s Emission Trading System (free allowance of CO2 quotas granted after an in-depth analysis of the emission profile, best available technologies and so on). But the sectoral coverage is not the same: the possible coverage of carbon border measures will be limited to sectors like cement and steel where the risk of carbon leakage is the highest while the sectoral coverage of the carbon leakage measures has a wider scope (chemicals, textile fibres, textile dyeing and finishing activities for instance). That means that there is a risk of creating losing sectors that will lose their free allowance of CO2 and will not benefit from any carbon shield at the border.\n3/ Technical, legal and economic uncertainties\nAccording to the European Commission, the future carbon border measures will be commensurate with the internal EU carbon price. What if due to the partial collapse of industrial production in the EU as a consequence of drastic containment measures, there is a carbon price collapse (3-5 € per ton)? That will mean that the “level playing field” effect will be diminished by as much. According to the European Commission, the methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing will be based on the EU-wide benchmarks developed for industrial processes. Are they available for all sectors? Are they internationally recognised? Do they reflect the best available technologies in the potentially targeted third countries? What happens if a third country believes it is above the European benchmark? The future carbon measures should be compliant with WTO rules and other international obligations of the EU. This essentially means that they must be non—discriminatory and proportionate according to the case-law.\n4/ Comparison with other tools pursuing the same goals\nIn the series of consultation conducted in 2019, the ICC explored 3 other trade-related tools conducive to achieving ambitious climate goals:\na/ Carbon Clubs\nThis term embraces a group of nations that decide to coordinate their climate policies and share exclusive membership perks like the EU ETS. Like-minded countries could create smarter trade rules between themselves than in bigger negotiating blocks. They could drive deeper and faster mitigation action by linking members’ emission trading schemes (like EU and Switzerland), reducing the risk of carbon leakage, and scaling-up climate ambition. The more powerful and the more numerous carbon\n2\nLorganisation mondiale des entreprises\nclubs they are, the more we are moving the world towards a harmonised global carbon price. This tool, based on the goodwill of the parties, is less coercive and litigious than others but does not offer a quick solution to cases of environmental dumping.\nb/ Carbon pricing\nCarbon pricing is the key instrument to push companies to reduce their emissions and to stimulate long run investments to foster the ecological transition. Currently 57 national governments in the world (Europe, Argentina, South Africa, China, ten US states and so on) have put a price on carbon through emissions trading systems (from very high levels like in Sweden to low ones like in Latin America). Business and financial institutions are starting, regardless of the existence of a national carbon pricing scheme, to introduce the same carbon standards wherever they operate.\nA carbon price corrects market distortions, drives industrial modernization, and helps ensure competitiveness. According to the IMF, the average global price for carbon is USD2 per tonne while an average of USD 75 per tonne will be necessary to reach the Paris Agreement goal. This tool is a global game changer to fight climate change but the system is fragmented without sufficient cooperation between regional and local carbon markets. That’s the reason why Carbon clubs could help in the transition period before a global price for carbon is reached.\nc/ WTO waiver\nA WTO climate waiver would enable WTO members to take climate measures internally and externally (at the borders) that will take the form of carbon markets, carbon clubs, or Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms. This waiver based for instance on the article XX of GATT should define what a climate response measure is as defined by the UNFCCC, and avoid being discriminatory or a disguised trade restriction. Such a multilateral mechanism will produce structural and global effects of a large magnitude but, given the WTO current decision-making process based on the consensus, one can’t expect a quick and swift adoption.\nIn conclusion, ICC France would like to insist on the necessity to combine the various available tools in order to combat the climate crisis and to modernise and reform the multilateral trading system according the following steps:\n1. As relevant international organisations and business consider that the carbon pricing signal is key to obtaining effective progress in combating climate change and in creating an attractive environment for investments in the long-run in order to accelerate ecological transition for public and private actors (industry, transports, housing, agriculture and so on), ICC France pleads in favour of the adoption of an international carbon price that should be acceptable for all (like 2 USD per ton), with an upward trajectory.\n2. In the transition period before the adoption of global carbon pricing, as well as a common agreed methodology to measure carbon footprints, regional carbon pricing between like-minded countries (EU- 27/UK/Switzerland, Latin America, Middle-West and so on, South East-Asia and so on) should be gradually harmonised. The creation of such regional carbon markets will imply common carbon market infrastructures (a kind of Carbon Single Market) while some carbon specific mechanisms could be put in place vis-a-vis third countries (a kind of carbon TARIC — integrated carbon tariff).\n3. In order to avoid the emergence of a carbon trade war between countries and regional customs unions, a WTO waiver that will establish the rules according to which these carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (carbon tax, ETS-mirror, standards) must be set up and function in compliance with 2 WTO key principles: proportionality and non-discrimination.\n* KK"

It should be noted that the risk of carbon leakage is not limited to the threat of relocation of activities but also impinge on daily operations and profitability and most importantly, future investments. \nIt is difficult to assess whether CBAM will be a measure that can effectively create a level playing field vis-à-vis 3rd countries with no GHG obligations. We are in great doubt about this. If such a scheme is to be introduced, it is paramount that it cannot be questioned within the confines of the WTO rules. \nThe EU ETS has embedded carbon leakage measures with free allowances and the possibility for MS to grant compensation for indirect costs in the electricity price. Indications that these measures could be substituted by CBAM give rise to deep concern among Norwegian undertakings. Stability of framework conditions is of key importance, not the least with regard to investments and industry need predictability.\n\nThrough the EEA-agreement, Norway is fully integrated in the internal market and have been part of the EU ETS since 2008.\nIt is not possible to give an adequate assessment of the legal basis without knowing the design of the measure. Should Art. 192 TFEU become the basis, one could envisage that Norway would be obliged to follow suit, given that this article is reflected inn EEA, Annex XX. Norway, neither through the EEA or otherwise, is not bound by Art. 207 and if this article forms the basis for CBAM other solutions has in case to be found regarding the EEA/EFTA countries. These undecided points give further ground for concern. Norwegian industry cannot live with such legal uncertainty.\n\nLikely impacts are hard to determine, nevertheless we give the following remarks and questions:  \n-The yet undesigned CBAM, including operational instruments (e.g. taxes, tariffs, regulations, allowances etc.) increases uncertainty for industry,\n-An initial trial period encompassing steel and cement, could in principle be followed by other energy intensive sectors. Without consultations, this cannot be accepted, \n-How will CBAM cater for European export and import of intermediaries likely to go into products bound for re-export?\n-The administrative burden for companies is expected to rise,\n-How is the concept of \"carbon footprint\" to be defined; how to deal with complex products and advanced transnational value chains?\n-WTO; 'like product', Most favoured Nation principle, Art.XX (b)?\n-Possible trade restricting retaliations from key trading partners cannot be excluded,\n-CBAM measures might potentially be side-lined by 3rd countries by only directing their \"green\" products to Europe, whereas carbon intensive products are directed to other markets thus having no effect on global mitigating efforts,\n-Eliminating ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation in favour of CBAM must be regarded as potentially counterproductive, both with regard to European industrial competitiveness, carbon leakage and mitigation of the global climate challenge. \nWhichever form, EU CBAM seem presently to deliver more problems than solutions for the Norwegian process industry. \n\nEuropean energy intensive industry cannot be included in a CBAM system without thorough and necessary consultations. Ideas proffered so far does not cater for companies trading globally, there is no legal certainty, revenues from a potential CBAM could end up anywhere and there is no proof that any such a system would benefit the climate challenge, hinder carbon- and investment leakage, nor contribute to an international level playing field.\nThe Federation of Norwegian Industries fully support the New Green Deal. Based on close to 100% fossil free energy and in the technological forefront, we presented our vison for a carbon free industry by 2047 as early as 2016.\nBefore launching a CBAM proposal the Commission should explore other instruments.",

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

National measures to address climate change which have an impact on trade can be compatible with WTO law.\nWTO law must be interpreted ‘in the light of contemporary concerns of the community of nations about the protection and conservation of the environment’.\nWTO Appellate Body (AB) in US-Shrimp, October 1998\n‘the results obtained from certain actions, for instance, measures adopted in order to attenuate global warming and climate change eeeee can only be evaluated with the benefit of time’.\nAB in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres, December 2007\n2. These national measures can include border measures.\nA border measure does not have to be identical to the domestic measure.\nThere is a requirement of even-handedness but without the requirement of identical treatment of domestic and imported goods.\nAB in US-Gasoline, May 1996\nIf there is ‘a genuine relationship of ends and means’ and the border measure makes a ‘material contribution’ to the achievement of the environmental objective then a border measure can be considered ‘necessary’.\nAB in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres\nWTO law recognises the EU’s sovereign right to set as high a level of protection of the environment as it determines to be appropriate. This right is not unfettered. If the high ambition includes a border measure then it must not be a disguised restriction on international trade or discriminate between countries where the same conditions prevail or discriminate between imported and domestic goods.\nGATT Articles Ill and XX\nGATT Article XX\n3. The EU can legitimately have higher climate ambitions than other countries.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nHigh EU standards can have the de facto effect of exporting those standards to companies wishing to sell into the EU market. This is most clearly seen, for example, in the health and safety of imported foods or chemicals complying with REACH. This de facto effect is not incompatible with trade law.\n4. The Climate Border Measure should not be a tariff or import charge\nTo avoid a GATT Il inconsistency, the triggering of the imposition of the charge must not be importation itself but an internal factor such as consumption.\nAB in China-Auto Parts, January 2009\nGATT Article II prohibits the imposition of duties or charges of any kind in excess of the tariffs set out ina Member’s Country Schedule.\n5 ‘As Such’ and ‘As Applied’: the Architecture of the EU’s border measure\nWTO Panels and the Appellate Body judge if a measure is compatible with WTO law ‘as such’ or ‘as applied’. An ‘as such’ review examines whether the national law itself is compatible with WTO law. An ‘as applied’ review examines whether the WTO member has acted in breach of WTO law when applying the national law.\nThe shape or architecture of the EU’s carbon border measure must aim at ‘as such’ compliance.\n6. The Architecture of a border measure must address the EU’s climate objective\n[W]e consider that a measure’s purposes, objectively manifested in the design, architecture and structure of the measure, are intensely pertinent to the task of evaluating whether or not that measure is applied so as to afford protection to domestic production.\nAB Chile-Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages, December 1999\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator and the second highest indirect emissions intensity among the 8 eligible sectors.\nThe European Steel Association\n1920\nIndirect emission\nTrade\nleakage indicator\nintensity\n(GOS instead of GVA)\nintensity\n[kg CO2 / EUR GOS]\nINAcE | 203-2015 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015\n1411 |Manufacture ofleatherclothes|__—_—3,029_— | 83,00% | 3,650\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\nefined petroleum products\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nSimilarly, the section 3.1.1 on aid intensity and degressivity of the consultants’ study assesses the impact of indirect costs (with a carbon price of 25€/t) after 75% compensation taking into account the GVA. In such assessment, among the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has around the fourth indirect costs impact (after 75% compensation), which is comparable to the sectors with the lower impact (blue bars below). Yet, if labour costs are excluded from the denominator (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector have very clearly the second highest impact (orange bars below), with a large difference above the remaining sectors.\nIndirect CO2 costs after 75% compensation\n5,4%\n5,0%\n4,3%\n4,0%\n2,9%\n3,0%\n2,3%\n2,1%\n2,0%\n1,9\n1,8%\n:\n1,39\n1,3%\n1,6%\n0 99\n0,99\n0,89\n0,9\n1,0%\n0,7\n0,69\n0,0%\n&\nxe)\nny\nCo\nSS\nov\n<2\nNo\nSS\nx2\n¥\ns\nNS\nRS\n<O\nSs\n<O\ngf\n&\ney\nS\nR\nNs\nSy\nBS\nAS\nNe’\nSS\n6\nRo\ny\nRNa\n»\nwv?\n&\nae\n&\ns”?\n<8\nSs\nKO\n‘Sy\ne\nPS\nwv?\n&\n<O\noe\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GVA\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GOS\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nThe above analysis is even more relevant if one considers the profitability of the eligible sectors.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

The Green Deal mentions the need to reduce the risk of carbon leakage should differences in the level of ambition of various regions of the World persist. \n\nEIGA fully supports the general idea of protecting EU industry from external imports not subjected to the same environmental standards. However, when implementing such a CBAM any action should be avoided that creates an uneven playing field in the industrial value chain. This applies in particular to market distortions by which insourced production of industrial gases by EIGA’s customer becomes more financially attractive than outsourced production by EIGA’s members which has been proven to be more energy and environmentally efficient. \n\nIndustrial gases - predominantly air gases (such as oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) and hydrogen - play an essential role in energy-intensive industries such as metals, refineries and chemicals. In developed markets, insourced and outsourced production of these gases compete strongly with each other but – with investments aimed at achieving the highest levels of safety, industrial efficiency, environmental care and at providing low-carbon solutions – industrial gases companies have for many years demonstrated their competitiveness with their customers’ insourced production option.  It has been industrial gases companies that have been a driving force in the development of new and environmentally beneficial applications of their products.\n\nThe lack of a level playing field between outsourced and insourced production of these gases would cancel all the benefits of the outsourcing model and introduce an unacceptable market distortion, to the detriment of companies and industrial value chains that have outsourced their industrial gases requirements as well as to the environmental and energy efficiency objectives of the EU.\n",

It is also a central measure of the new European Green Deal strategy.\nCurrently, the cost of CO2 emissions for producers in the EU is regulated by the Emissions Trading System. However, this system does not apply to non-EU producers, who often do not have the same emission reduction constraints and do not bear the same costs as European producers.\nEuropean steel companies are developing different innovative technologies to reduce their emissions in line with EU targets to ensure the transition to a cleaner economy. But to implement this change, there is a need for an appropriate regulatory framework both at European and global level. In the absence of a common global framework, an adjustment at the frontier of the cost of carbon can be an appropriate way of sharing the burden fairly and encouraging everyone to engage in the fight against climate change. \nFor proposals and comments from the European steel industry (Eurofer), see the attached document (in English), which we hope to be taken into account by the Commission, in view of the forthcoming decisions and legislative proposals.",

        "feedback": "Amici della Terra Onlus believe that the best way to introduce a non-discriminatory Carbon Tax in the EU would be the proposal developed by Prof. Gerbeti, called \"Tax on Added Emissions (ImEA)”. This would not be punitive for European industry and, conversely, it would enhances its characteristics of sustainability. The proposal to introduce ImEA has already been subject of a resolution adopted by Environment and Industry Commissions of the Italian Senate.\nThe basic concept is to introduce a tax on the product's carbon intensity that acts as an environmental taxation lever through the modulation of VAT rates: a relief for less emissive products (mostly European) and a consequent increase for more pollutant ones. This environmental taxation instrument doesn't have the aim of increasing tax revenues, but aims to encourage cleaner productions and to discourage less clean ones, regardless of where the goods are produced.\n\nThe proposed new VAT regime would be applied both to EU-made products and imported ones and would therefore be non-discriminatory and compatible with WTO rules.\nFor products made in European plants subjected to the ETS system, the carbon intensity per product unit could be attested by the already available administrative and control tools.\nFor products made in European plants not subjected to the ETS, or for imported products from non-EU countries, the carbon intensity per product unit with respect to the reference benchmarks could be attested by certifications issued on the basis of international standards of technical norms such as ISO 14064 and with traceability procedures such as those offered by the blockchain procedure application.\n\nThe ImEA proposal has already been presented to the European Parliament; it is considered in a positive way by ENEA, FLAEI (the main trade union for electrical workers), and by notable industrial associations.\n\nImEA has also been indicated by the European Economic and Social Committee among the hypotheses that the Commission is required to investigate, as well as the reform of the ETS, the carbon adjustment on the borders and, precisely, following the presentation that Prof. Gerbeti herself made at EESC, a VAT rate adjusted to the intensity of the carbon produced.\n\nFinally, a proposal for a ImEA-similar measure was presented last May by the Spanish government to the outgoing commissioners for Climate and Energy, Miguel Arias Canete and for Economic Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, following the initiative of the Spanish minister of Energy Teresa Ribera and Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero.\n\nThe ImEA is not a duty but a new path that the EU can open to transform sustainability into one of the parameters of global competition. Indeed, the ETS Directive itself provides that measures can be introduced to support sectors exposed to carbon leakage, basing on the carbon intensity parameters adopted as benchmarks by the EU.\n\nWe hope that there will be the opportunity for a discussion on this issue that can involve all of the stakeholders interested in the ImEA proposal, and that this will be an opportunity for a true confrontation in the interest of Europe.",

Né appare credibile che i caschi blu, in nome dell’UNFCCC, entrino armi in pugno nei confini nazionali, cinesi o indiani o altro, per imporre il rispetto degli impegni sulle emissioni: “Mani in alto!

Un buon punto di partenza è la consapevolezza manifestata di recente dal Governo italiano circa l’effettiva posizione dell’Italia in questo percorso. L’ISPRA ha certificato il raggiungimento nel 2014 per l’Italia dell'obiettivo UE 2020 di riduzione dei gas serra (-20% rispetto al 1990) consentendo di superare l'atteggiamento che ha sempre rappresentato l’Italia come l’ultima della classe senza comprendere le eccellenze del Paese in questo ambito e il loro potenziale per lo sviluppo di politiche ambientali avanzate.\nUn altro punto buon punto di partenza è la nuova impostazione delle politiche UE per gli obiettivi 2030 che ha rimosso gli obiettivi vincolanti a livello nazionale per le rinnovabili e previsto, invece, un processo di verifica e cooperazione più stretta nella definizione dei nuovi piani nazionali 2030 per l'energia e il clima.\nIn base a questi indirizzi, l’Italia può ora ridefinire il ruolo dell’efficienza energetica e delle fonti rinnovabili nelle proprie politiche energetico ambientali, ridefinendo l’allocazione di risorse in passato attribuite solo in favore delle rinnovabili elettriche che pesa circa 13 miliardi all'anno sulle bollette degli italiani e penalizza la competitività degli usi efficienti del vettore elettrico. L’eccesso di risorse impegnate dal nostro Paese (e da altri paesi europei) sullo strumento meno efficiente per la riduzione dei gas serra risulta evidente se si pensa che a Parigi è rimasto irrisolto anche il problema dei 100 miliardi di dollari all'anno che complessivamente i paesi ricchi del globo dovrebbero mettere a disposizione di quelli poveri per sostenere in modo equo il loro sforzo per la riduzione dei gas serra senza essere penalizzati nel loro percorso di sviluppo.\nLa strategia energetico ambientale italiana al 2030 potrà e dovrà essere basata prioritariamente sulla promozione dell'efficienza energetica in chiave di aumento della competitività del sistema paese, sulla diffusione delle rinnovabili termiche e sulla penetrazione degli usi efficienti del vettore elettrico. Si tratta innanzitutto di disegnare una strategia di politica industriale ed economica mirata a superare virtuosamente la crisi economica che ancora pesa sulle prospettive del Paese e di generare un ciclo economico positivo che possa alimentare la stagione di investimenti, da parte di imprese e famiglie, necessari per conseguire gli obiettivi 2030 di politica energetica e ambientale. In questa chiave, è necessaria una valutazione dei limiti e delle contraddizioni del meccanismo ETS e la ricerca di strategie e strumenti di intervento più avanzati per le politiche di decarbonizzazione.\nEU-ETS\nL'Europa ha recepito gli obiettivi del Protocollo di Kyoto e si appresta a dare seguito agli impegni di Parigi principalmente con il meccanismo dell’EU-ETS: un sistema Cap &Trade, che fissa un tetto massimo delle emissioni, a livello di impianti produttivi localizzati nel territorio europeo, e consente ai partecipanti di acquistare e vendere quote di emissione secondo le loro necessità all’interno di tale limite.\nAmici della Terra, 21 novembre 2016\nImposta sulle Emissioni Aggiunte, IMEA\nOgni anno le imprese devono migliorare del 1.74% la propria efficienza ambientale nella produzione di beni. L'applicazione di questo fattore conduce ad una riduzione complessiva delle emissioni del 21% entro il 2020 rispetto al livello del 2005. Con la Dir. 2009/29/CE s’introduce il principio generale di assegnazione onerosa, tramite aste, delle quote di emissione (art.10). In realtà l'allocazione a titolo gratuito rimane per un numero molto grande di impianti e settori e risponde alla logica di “mantenere la competitività internazionale, perché gli impianti più efficienti in questi settori (ETS) non dovrebbero sostenere costi del carbonio indebiti che porterebbero alla rilocalizzazione delle emissioni di CO,?”.\nIn pratica le istituzioni europee affermano che se questi settori dovessero pagare i costi per la decarbonizzazione, per minori emissioni, perderebbero competitività nel mercato europeo e internazionale. Quindi, per evitare il rischio che le imprese falliscano o che vadano a produrre fuori dal territorio europeo, il cosiddetto carbon leakage, si offre la possibilità di emettere gratuitamente.\nL’ETS si basa sull'idea che a un determinato livello di prezzo delle quote di emissione, individuato in ca. € 30/tonCO,, le imprese ritengano più conveniente emettere di meno efficientandosi da un punto di vista energetico e approvvigionarsi di fonti rinnovabili.\nIn realtà, nonostante le modifiche normative e il progressivo innalzamento degli standard emissivi, il mercato delle quote di CO, è entrato in crisi per l'eccesso di offerta legato alla riduzione della produzione industriale europea. Il surplus di quote all’inizio del 2013 era di 2,1 Mld di quote. La Commissione Europea prevedeva che, in assenza di un intervento, l'eccedenza di 2 Mld sarebbe rimasta costante al 2020. A gennaio 2015, la Commissione europea? ha adottato la misura di back loading (accantonamento di quote), togliendo dal mercato un significativo numero di quote (400 Min nel 2014, 300 MIn nel 2015 e 200 MIn nel 2016) eppure il prezzo non è risalito e a settembre 2016 segnava uno sconsolante €4,17/tonCO,, peraltro in inesorabile discesa per tutto il 2016.

L’ETS funzionerebbe solo se il mondo finisse alle colonne d'Ercole e se l'Europa fosse un'entità economica isolata.\nOccorre aggiungere un’ultima considerazione: il sistema ETS prevede che ci sia un’autorità centrale nazionale che contabilizza le emissioni; dunque, anche se tutto il mondo adottasse lo schema di riferimento europeo dovremmo accettare che siano autorità di paesi extra-UE con bassi standard di trasparenza a informarci sui reali livelli di emissioni delle industrie locali.\nE la fiducia non è aiutata dal precedente nel quale il governo di Pechino ammette di aver sottostimato del 17% le emissioni di CO;. Un valore incrementale che, da solo, pesa quanto il totale delle emissioni della Germania”.\nENERGIA ED ECONOMIA\nIl costo energetico di produzione è decisivo per analizzare l'impatto che ha sulla competitività manifatturiera industriale, ed è determinato da due fattori:\n. aumenta con l'incremento del prezzo dell’energia, e si attenua con gli interventi di efficienza energetica.\nA livello europeo molti studi che analizzano le ambiziose politiche europee sul clima e l’ambiente, evidenziano la perdita di competitività e la pressione subita all'economia europea da parte delle altre economie cosiddette emergenti.\n°Il Consiglio ha adottato la decisione sulla creazione di una riserva stabilizzatrice del mercato relativa al sistema per lo scambio di quote di emissione dei gas a effetto serra dell'UE (EU ETS) che mira a correggere gli squilibri strutturali tra domanda e offerta nell'EU ETS.\n* International New York Times del 3 novembre 2015\nAmici della Terra, 21 novembre 2016\nImposta sulle Emissioni Aggiunte, IMEA\nLa manifattura industriale, specialmente quella energivora, soffre maggiormente il costo dell'energia e alcune imprese, con l'aumento di questo valore e in un contesto di economia globalizzata, rischiano di uscire dal mercato.\nPer i settori energivori, i benefici dell’efficienza non sono ancora sufficienti a compensare l'aumento dei prezzi dell'energia. A livello europeo l'aumento dell’1% della parte costi dell'elettricità comporta la riduzione del 1,6% dell’export?.\nIl rapporto tra i prezzi del gas naturale, assumendo come unità il costo in USA, vede l'Europa pagare 3,2 volte e la Cina 4,3 a parità di valore energetico®, ed è questo un dato da non sottovalutare in considerazione del fatto che l’industria italiana, ad esempio, produce per il 33% a gas. Il costo dell’elettricità, stante sempre 1 per gli USA, è pari a 1,7 per la Cina e addirittura 2,2 per l'Europa”.\nTra i paesi europei e quelli OCSE, l’Italia è il fanalino di coda per i costi di approvvigionamento e tassazione.\nL'Europa è l’area più costosa del mondo da un punto di vista energetico e questo conduce a un disequilibrio dei costi di produzione industriale nelle 3 macro regioni. Ad esempio, la crescita del PIL statunitense rispetto all’Area Euro, è straordinaria. L'Europa ha perso dal 2009 al 2015 ben 11,5 punti percentuali. Nello stesso periodo gli Stati Uniti sono cresciuti del 24,5%.

Finora, l'Europa ha impostato — su temi assoluti e condivisibili come la protezione dell'ambiente e il non depauperamento delle risorse del pianeta — una politica energetica e ambientale in base al pregiudizio non dichiarato che l’industria sia necessariamente contraria all'ambiente.\nIn questo periodo di grande sforzo ambientale sono emersi due dati nuovi:\n1) l'industria per prima ha compreso una via sostenibile di produzione. Di più: l’industria lavora, in molti casi, per e non contro lo sviluppo sostenibile; 2) non può esserci sviluppo se questo è gravato da imposizioni ineliminabili sul costo energetico che pesa sull'industria europea e sulla sua competitività sul mercato internazionale.\nO si abbassa il costo energetico o lo si riequilibra con i competitor internazionali.\nPer ciò che riguarda l’Italia, l'indice della produzione dell'industria manifatturiera, che misura la variazione nel tempo del volume fisico della produzione, indica un andamento drammatico per il nostro tessuto produttivo.

World Energy Outlook “Energy and Climate Change\"\nAmici della Terra, 21 novembre 2016\n394,9\n’\nImposta sulle Emissioni Aggiunte, IMEA\nLa realtà economica sembra suggerire che, di fatto, l’EU ha delocalizzato anche le emissioni di CO; evidenziando una bilancia commerciale fortemente in negativo con paesi terzi, come la Cina.\nOggi, quasi tutti difendono l’ETS considerandolo il male minore. Infatti la Commissione europea sembra rassicurare le industrie continentali con le residuali sacche di salvaguardia in termini di permessi gratuiti per i settori a rischio carbon leakage. Ma questo, più che una salvaguardia della competitività europea sembra essere una tutela dello stesso ETS.\nMa se davvero la Commissione dovesse riuscire a far funzionare il meccanismo e ad alzare il prezzo delle quote di CO, al prezzo “utile” di 30€/ton, e se progressivamente erodesse le percentuali di quote gratuite ai settori carbon leakage, quali impatti devastanti avrebbe sull’industria e sull'occupazione europea?\nIMEA - L'IMPOSTA SULLE EMISSIONI AGGIUNTE\nII punto è trovare una via economicamente sostenibile per abbassare realmente le emissioni globali, non limitarsi a delocalizzarle, come se la CO; si fermasse alla frontiera del paese produttore/emettitore.\nIn attesa di futuribili svolte tecnologiche come quella della fusione fredda o di qualunque altra produzione energetica non emissiva e a basso costo, dobbiamo confrontarci con il contesto economico e tecnologico attuale.\nL'Europa ha fatto grandi sforzi non solo con l’ETS ma anche con un impegno straordinario sulle fonti rinnovabili, che sono vanificati, industrialmente e ambientalmente, da maggiori importazioni dai “paradisi emissivi”, quei paesi produttori che stanno competendo e vincendo con la nostra industria.\nI consumatori europei, soprattutto in questa lunga fase recessiva, si trovano a dover scegliere sul medesimo mercato continentale tra prodotti con caratteristiche simili ma con prezzi finali diversi, derivanti dal diverso costo di approvvigionamento dell’energia e dall’adempimento di altri vincoli ambientali vigenti e più stringenti in Europa. È inevitabile che il consumatore europeo scelga il prodotto meno costoso.\nIn questo modo sono poste le basi per una serie di conseguenze economiche e ambientali:\na) una perdita di competitività dei prodotti locali europei a basso contenuto di CO; nel mercato interno a favore dei beni “dopati” dall’utilizzo di vettori energetici inquinanti ed economici; b) per massimizzare il profitto ci sarà un sempre maggiore approvvigionamento energetico ad alta intensità emissiva, perché meno costoso, da parte delle industrie dei paesi senza vincoli ambientali.\nAmici della Terra, 21 novembre 2016\nImposta sulle Emissioni Aggiunte, IMEA\nc) il consumatore europeo indurrà in tentazione il proprietario della fabbrica europea a spostare la propria produzione nei “paradisi emissivi”, dove potrà godere di manodopera ed energia a bassi costi; d) questo creerà un aumento delle emissioni medie mondiali per unità di prodotto derivante dall’utilizzo di un mix energetico meno pulito di quello europeo, ma i costi legati all’adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici ricadranno invece sull’intera economia mondiale.\nSe l'inquinamento è globale e non territoriale, la sua circolazione non sarà impedita dall'adozione di regole nazionali. Allora occorre far emergere questa esternalità sui beni prodotti tramite uno strumento di fiscalità ambientale sul contenuto di CO; dei prodotti.\nL'unica strada per non svilire ulteriormente l'industria continentale, anzi per farle recuperare competitività sul versante dei costi energetici, è quella di imporre un prezzo amministrato alla CO, “contenuta” nei beni, sia che questi vengano prodotti localmente, sia che vengano importati da territori extra EU.\nLo strumento che viene proposto è quello di perequare questo costo tramite una modulazione mirata delle aliquote dell'IVA applicata: una Imposta sulle Emissioni Aggiunte.\nData la migliore efficienza dell'industria europea, temprata da oltre un decennio di politiche ambientali, l'IVA sui prodotti europei sarebbe generalmente più bassa dell’attuale imposizione. A questo farebbe da contraltare una imposizione superiore per i beni fabbricati con bassi standard ambientali e alte emissioni. Quindi, con un impatto tendenzialmente neutro sul gettito fiscale.\nUn costo amministrato non risentirebbe delle fluttuazioni del mercato del carbonio e le imprese potrebbero fare piani industriali sull’efficientamento sicure di un orizzonte di costi stabile nel tempo.\n— —_ © n —@ mm\n—_—» IVA 31%\ns0 E — E — A — E — I E I N I E I E\n=_= IVA 21%\nsa\nBenchmark\nIVA 11%\nso\nCosì, con una riduzione delle\naliquote dell'IVA dei prodotti\ncon minore contenuto di CO),\nsi incentiverebbero sia il\nProdotto Efficiente\nProdotto Emissivo\nmiglioramento dell’efficienza\nFigura 7 - Schema dell'imposizione.

II, comma 2 del GATTI).\nPerché l'equivalenza di condizioni di accesso ai mercati sia attualizzata occorre che le imprese di paesi terzi possano, su base volontaria, dimostrare che i loro processi produttivi sono compliance con i parametri europei.\nCiò è necessario perché, presumere che il singolo produttore, ad esempio, coreano emetta in base al mix energetico della Corea è voler presumere troppo, perché questo produttore potrebbe scegliere di approvvigionarsi di energia a bassa intensità emissiva o, semplicemente, perché i suoi impianti potrebbero essere più efficienti della media degli impianti coreani. Quindi impugnerebbe certamente, e con successo, un eventuale provvedimento che lo vedesse equiparato alle emissioni medie del suo paese.\nInoltre, questa presunzione comporta che se si attribuisce alla determinata e specifica industria coreana un mix energetico pari alle emissioni medie nazionali, il produttore coreano potrebbe approvvigionarsi di energia a più basso costo e, dunque, più emissiva per lucrare sul differenziale di carbonio con il mix energetico del proprio paese.\nInvece offrendo la possibilità al produttore extraeuropeo di dimostrare le proprie emissioni per avere uno sconto d’IVA sul mercato europeo, il rapporto intercorrerebbe con le singole industrie e non con gli Stati esteri e, oltre\nYyw\nogni ragionevole contestazione, la quantità\nZi EZ3 Za all LS\nRÒ_T —%\n»-\nVa\ndi emissioni per prodotto e la sua\ngent --\nvalorizzazione diverrebbe uno dei parametri Ù] la di © BI della competizione internazionale. \\ = Si di implementare un in WM “n, propone processo base al quale un Ente Accreditatore Europeo riconosca società di diritto privato per le e verifiche e le certificazioni di tutti i soggetti \\_ industriali che, su base volontaria, richiedano questa certificazione.

Perché sarebbero i soggetti privati industriali a pagare all'ente verificatore i costi di verifica e lo farebbero sulla base del vantaggio che deriverebbe dal non incorrere nell’aggravio dell’IVA sui prodotti loro venduti sul mercato europeo.\n11\nAmici della Terra, 21 novembre 2016\nImposta sulle Emissioni Aggiunte, IMEA\nCon la IMEA il rischio di truffe sarebbe estremamente basso perché il controllo sarebbe lineare, ossia, a prescindere da dove sia fabbricata una scarpa, per produrla non bisogna emettere più di una certa quantità di CO;. Un controllo di tipo aritmetico e non algebrico, con scarse incognite e pochissime variabili.\nIn secondo luogo bisogna considerare che l'accreditamento presso l’ente europeo avrebbe per le società private di verifica un significativo valore economico perché, come detto, le richieste di verifica e certificazioni potrebbero essere virtualmente infinite; dunque, l'emissione di certificazioni inesatte o inappropriate con il rischio di perdere, a fronte di un controllo, l'accreditamento europeo sarebbe un danno gravissimo, sicuramente superiore agli introiti derivanti da pratiche di verifica fraudolente.\nLa truffa, in ultima analisi, non sarebbe mai realmente vantaggiosa.\nLa profilazione dei target emissivi sui beni dovrebbe avvenire in maniera graduale e, per un periodo di tempo, residuale rispetto alle categorie produttive già soggette a ETS, espandersi e aggiornarsi nel tempo e, sul medio periodo, sostituire lo stesso ETS.\nCONCLUSIONI\nSe l'Europa decide di stabilire livelli di efficienza adeguati per la produzione, ad esempio, di una pentola, deve essere possibile imputare livelli reali di emissioni, maggiori o minori, sia che questa venga fabbricata in Europa sia che venga fabbricata in Cina. Bisogna permettere al produttore, quindi, di non subire un’ingiustizia, di non essere soggetto di un pregiudizio. Bisogna, in altri termini, consentirgli di dimostrare che la sua produzione avviene mantenendo livelli di emissioni efficienti e, quindi, che il contenuto di CO; per unità di prodotto è in linea, (o) inferiore, a quanto stabilito dall’EU per non incorrere nell’inasprimento dell'IVA sul bene. Occorre lasciare che sia competitivo sul mercato sulla base dei propri limiti o delle proprie virtù, senza pregiudizi di provenienza.\nPer questo occorre utilizzare uno strumento che agisca anche sul mercato d’importazione per stabilire standard ambientali anche per le produzioni extra-europee e restituire nel frattempo competitività all'industria europea.\nAprirci quindi alla possibilità di una competizione di mercato non solo sulla qualità dei prodotti e il prezzo di acquisto, ma anche sull'efficienza emissiva nella produzione.\nLa CO; come nuovo parametro produttivo, competitivo mondiale. E l'Europa partirebbe avvantaggiata.\n12\nAmici della Terra, 21 novembre 2016"

Our assessment is that the change should not disadvantage the strength of European industry, as it simply means that we move the CO2 emissions problem to other parts of the world.\n\nA proposal has been made to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax for materials and/or products imported into the EU. The European Commission has proposed that a levy on imported goods based on the carbon emitted (during production) would be a good way of avoiding carbon leakage and keeping European businesses competitive. However, it must be stressed that such a measure would have the exact opposite effect on the EU: If a carbon tax was only imposed on raw materials such as steel, aluminium and plastics, if a carbon tax was imposed only on raw materials such as steel, aluminium and plastic; If a carbon tax was applied only to imported raw materials, it would affect finished goods produced in the EU but not outside it. This would make finished goods produced in Europe more expensive and therefore less favourable for European consumers.\n\nIf a levy on the production of raw materials is introduced for raw materials, it must also be introduced for finished goods.\n\nIntroducing a tax on imported raw materials without extending it to finished goods would create a clear incentive for companies to relocate their production facilities outside the EU. Moreover, this tax would simply shift the carbon leakage problem from the raw materials industry to the finished goods industry without addressing the problem, while harming the European economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the European Commission should be commended for its intentions to develop a greener economy, which is still based in a free trade system. However, the European Green affair is, by its nature, a continuous response to a global problem. The introduction of rules that affect European manufacturers must be taken into account in the context of the global economy for all industrial sectors and not just for the raw materials industry.\n\nAPPLiA — Home Appliances Sweden supports global action in the field of the environment and considers that European industry is well positioned to be a global leader in green technologies.

Together, we represent 27.4m customers in Europe.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the “EU Green Deal – Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.” GD4S acknowledges that this mechanism will move towards protecting the competitiveness of the European economy.  It will also leverage the decarbonisation potential of Europe’s existing energy infrastructure, and in doing so, minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers, meeting ‘Just Transition’ objectives.\n\nHaving reviewed the Roadmap, we make the following observations: \n\n1.\tGrowth strategy impacts on innovation and research \nGD4S fully supports the ambition of the European Green Deal to “transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society…with a competitive economy”, an economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and not threatened by carbon leakage.  We acknowledge this growth strategy and note that green technologies proven to contribute to decarbonisation goals also represent positive opportunities:\n•\tRenewable biomethane, which is net zero carbon and fully compatible with the existing gas networks, represents the least cost and least disruptive way to decarbonise home heating. \n•\tFor the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) is a necessity. CCS with Bioenergy has the potential to deliver negative emissions.\n•\tIn the longer term, hydrogen will play a major role in the EU’s energy mix. Renewable hydrogen can be produced using Power to Gas technology using excess renewable electricity. Hydrogen can also be produced from Natural Gas, and when combined with CCS technology decarbonised hydrogen can be produced. \n\n2.\tPrioritising a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy\nDelivering a carbon adjustment will make it more expensive to import carbon-intensive products and thereby potentially impact on a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy. With the Green Deal emphasising the need for a just and socially balanced transition, GD4S supports the view that:\n•\tRenewable gases (natural gas, biomethane or hydrogen) should remain part of the energy mix and will help protect downstream jobs in energy-intensive industries. \n•\tLeast cost and least disruptive technologies are deployed, with electrification, natural gas with CCS, renewable gases and renewable electricity all set to play significant roles in the 2050 energy system. \n•\tSeveral studies have shown that renewable & decarbonised gas provide the least disruptive way of decarbonising heating across the EU.  \n•\tLeveraging the decarbonisation potential within Europe’s existing energy infrastructure will also minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers.  \n\n3.\tWorking in Partnership\nThe EU Green Deal identifies the importance of “partnerships with industry and Member States”. Incentivising trade partners to decarbonise through the border adjustment will have an impact on global CO2 emissions. It may also enable the EU to become a leader in key technologies which unlock the development of hydrogen, including the electrolysers needed to produce Green Hydrogen.\nEurope is home to energy intensive industries, including the chemical and steel sectors, which have intensive energy and heat needs in their production processes.  We propose that revenues recouped as the result of the carbon border re-adjustment are ring-fenced and reinvested in technologies, such as CCS and hydrogen, which will help decarbonise these industries. Policy and fiscal support for sectors already on a positive 2050 trajectory is also valid and will assist in the development and commercialisation of new energy technologies, ensuring their competiveness. \n",

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator and the second highest indirect emissions intensity among the 8 eligible sectors.\nThe European Steel Association\n1920\nIndirect emission\nTrade\nleakage indicator\nintensity\n(GOS instead of GVA)\nintensity\n[kg CO2 / EUR GOS]\nINAcE | 203-2015 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015\n1411 |Manufacture ofleatherclothes|__—_—3,029_— | 83,00% | 3,650\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\nefined petroleum products\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nSimilarly, the section 3.1.1 on aid intensity and degressivity of the consultants’ study assesses the impact of indirect costs (with a carbon price of 25€/t) after 75% compensation taking into account the GVA. In such assessment, among the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has around the fourth indirect costs impact (after 75% compensation), which is comparable to the sectors with the lower impact (blue bars below). Yet, if labour costs are excluded from the denominator (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector have very clearly the second highest impact (orange bars below), with a large difference above the remaining sectors.\nIndirect CO2 costs after 75% compensation\n5,4%\n5,0%\n4,3%\n4,0%\n2,9%\n3,0%\n2,3%\n2,1%\n2,0%\n1,9\n1,8%\n:\n1,39\n1,3%\n1,6%\n0 99\n0,99\n0,89\n0,9\n1,0%\n0,7\n0,69\n0,0%\n&\nxe)\nny\nCo\nSS\nov\n<2\nNo\nSS\nx2\n¥\ns\nNS\nRS\n<O\nSs\n<O\ngf\n&\ney\nS\nR\nNs\nSy\nBS\nAS\nNe’\nSS\n6\nRo\ny\nRNa\n»\nwv?\n&\nae\n&\ns”?\n<8\nSs\nKO\n‘Sy\ne\nPS\nwv?\n&\n<O\noe\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GVA\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GOS\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nThe above analysis is even more relevant if one considers the profitability of the eligible sectors.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Increased protectionism worldwide\nThird countries’ trade restrictions have increased since the imposition of the EU definitive safeguard measures, increasing the risk of trade diversion to the weakened European market\na Threats of the U.S. President to double again the 25% tariff on Turkish steel imports illustrates the extreme volatility in the implementation of the Section 232 policy on\nThe European Steel Association\n11\nsteel — and the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy (which is itself a source of deflection). Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely. This is a worsening of the situation since the period considered in the First Review.\nThe European Steel Association\n12\nUS imports evolution - product scope: 26 Safeguard categories (in Ktonnes )\nr\n0\n10\n0\n4,0\n0\n3.0\nMi,\n6,000\nOn,\nNes\n/\n8\n9,000\n%\n%\n%\n10,000\n=@ Cumulated monthly variation vs pre-imposition $232 measures\n%».\n)\n&\n= Cumulated monthly variation y-o-y\n)\nSource: US International Trade Commission\n6. Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

        "feedback": "Charge on Added Emissions*\nThe green new deal and Climate law of President Von Der Leyen is an opportunity to correct some critical distortions for Italian and European industries including European emissions policy.\nThe European Commission has reached the awareness that the EUETS cannot close the gap of the competitive asymmetry between European companies and those located in territories, such as India and China or the USA, which have different energy costs and are not subject to environmental obligations; but the solution proposed at the moment, the carbon border tax, will not be able to protect our economy from “high emissive” global competition and prevent the delocalization of industries outside the EU.\nThe carbon tax is a classic duty, which can temporarily protect European industries only within the EU territory: any industry that exports outside the EU will “carry” the price of CO2 (which is paid on production side) on the final cost of goods, losing in competitiveness. Thus, for example, steel, ceramic or paper industry that exports to Turkey will compete in there with Indian competitors who without environmental obligations will be able to offer similar goods at lower costs. Companies that produce raw materials, such as steel, will have to deal with prices of these materials that are formed internationally without additional costs of European sustainability.\nFurthermore, the illusion of having structured an effective shield could induce the EU Commission to convey an even higher price of CO2 and remove free allowances from the carbon leakage sectors: a very serious risk for the manufacture industries and for their workers.\nThe Charge on Added Emissions  proposal provides an economically enhancement of actual CO2 emissions occurred during the manufacture of goods within the VAT, regardless of where the goods were produced. In this way, sustainability would be added to price and quality as a parameter of market competition, guaranteeing an industrial advantage for sustainable industries: a lower VAT for industries that emit within sustainable parameters (typically the vast majority of European ones) and a burden for highly emissive ones.\nThe traceability of “emissive transactions” could be solved through the blockchain tool. The Charge on Added Emissions represents a mechanism for equalizing environmental costs on products placed on the European market. At the same time, it creates a standard and a stimulus to reduce emissions because it does not target States which, as seen in various COP on climate change, are reluctant to adopt rules on emission reduction, but it speaks directly to industries. It proposes a parameter of international industrial competition for environmental protection.\nThe Charge on Added Emissions could represent a credible Italian and European proposal to fight climate change. It would benefit both the environment and industries.\n*A.

But in a context where they are:\njust to pay CO2 (as their free allowances are exhausted), Europe’s energy-intensive industries see their competitors enjoy a comparative advantage, which can be described as unfair.\nEven if not a panacea, putting this mechanism in place would be in the end a first step towards a competitive equity measure in line with WTO directives, building on existing legal tools, existing organisations and data already available under the CO2 trading system. I would point out that Jacques Delors, in order to set up a social Europe, had relied on this principle of equality in competition, so as to be able to move towards harmonisation towards the top of European countries on the internal market. Why not use the same principle towards non-EU competitors with social and ecological dumping from Europe.

For more details see: https://ember-climate.org/project/interconnectors-and-coal/ More interconnectors are in the pipeline, which could further increase this trend in the future.\n\nThe Western Balkans and Ukraine are part of the Energy Community Treaty and are obliged to comply with the EU’s now superseded Large Combustion Plants Directive. However their power stations are far from compliant with this legislation, adding to the appalling air pollution problems in the countries, which also impact the EU. \n\nSerbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina even plan to build more new coal power plants, built by Chinese companies, financed by Chinese banks and not compliant with EU industrial emissions legislation or State aid rules, under the assumption that they can avoid paying carbon costs until they join the EU. (See https://bankwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/China-Balkans-briefing_Dec-2019.pdf for details)\n\nGiven that EU accession is not expected within the next few years at least, this is too long to wait. Action has to be taken now. The Energy Community Treaty Contracting Parties need to introduce a carbon price. Montenegro and Ukraine have already made some first steps, but there is little incentive for others to follow their steps, or for these countries to ensure that carbon prices are high enough to be a real deterrent, if they are also allowed to keep selling their electricity to the EU under the same conditions as now. \n\nIn the electricity sector, a carbon border tax would encourage ETS countries to continue their phase-out of coal-based electricity. In non-ETS countries, if set at a level high enough to be a deterrent, a tax would help ensure that the life of power plants countries is not artificially prolonged and that new ones are clearly seen to be uneconomic. This way, it would implicitly address not only carbon emissions but also air pollution and other violations.\n\nThe tax must also apply to Energy Community countries if they do not start to apply CO2 emissions pricing on their own at a level which serves as a real incentive to decarbonise. As these countries have access to the EU energy market, they need to comply with the same environmental standards, state aid rules, and carbon pricing in the energy sector. Failure to do so will distort the market, disadvantaging electricity generators in countries at the edge of the EU who have to face cheaper competition from more polluting plants.\n\nIn addition, due to the EU’s increased efforts on climate, for countries planning to join the EU, it would be even harder to align with EU legislation in the future if work is not started on this now.\n\nBankwatch supports the introduction of a carbon border tax in the electricity sector because it:\n- Encourages more countries to take ambitious climate measures\n- Can solve the problem of carbon leakage in the electricity sector\n- Removes unfair competition from non-compliant and highly polluting plants in countries neighbouring the EU\n- Can help to protect local economies by supporting electricity generators adhering to EU rules.\n- Fills in the gaps that the EU-ETS cannot fill, regarding trading with non-EU countries\n- Circumvents the EU’s failure so far to close legal loopholes in Energy Community countries that encourage new coal mines and power plants.\n\nThe proceeds of any such tax must be used for a just and sustainable energy transition, and the tax must also mean an end to free ETS allowances for all sectors.\n",

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association\nSI\nNctm\nLuther.

GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nThe EU has chosen to achieve carbon neutrality by restricting the right to emit carbon. This policy addresses the carbon footprint of goods manufactured in the EU. This is a market-based approach (as opposed to a tax or standards approach).\nAs the EU has an internal a market-based mechanism imposing a market-based mechanism at the border is not likely to be considered WTO incompatible ‘as such’. A tax based approach at the border might be.\n7. Carbon leakage\nRecital 24 of Directive 2009/29 addresses two types of carbon leakage: emissions imbedded in imported goods, and emissions from industries that could leave the EU. The substantive provisions of the Directive only address carbon leakage from moving manufacturing abroad. Rules in relation to the carbon footprint of imported goods have not been elaborated.\nWTO law does not require that the means to avoid carbon leakage in imports are identical or even exactly mirror the avoidance of carbon leakage through moving manufacturing abroad. If they are considered different aspects of carbon leakage they can be addressed differently.\n8. Technical or Product Standards\nWTO members retain the sovereign right to set whatever standard they consider appropriate to achieve a legitimate public policy objective. The EU defends this right even to the point of setting standards for hormones in beef or on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which some consider are in breach of WTO law.\nThe standard would apply equally to domestic and imported goods. Products not meeting EU standards cannot be present in the European Union (whether produced domestically or abroad). These standards could be tightened over time.\n9. Conclusion\nIf EU policy is that all goods consumed in the EU must comply with the EU’s carbon emissions reduction policy then a properly constructed border measure can comply with WTO law.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nSPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF A CLIMATE BORDER MEASURE\nAny cost to be imposed on imports to be consumed in the EU should be at a level appropriate to the high level of the EU’s climate objective.\nThe EU’s policy of limiting and reducing emissions over time must also be applied to goods imported for consumption in the Union.\nThe EU’s climate objective cannot be achieved if production is shifted to countries with less ambitious objectives and thus less production cost. Therefore, the risk of carbon leakage can be addressed by a Climate Border Measure. Carbon leakage will not be prevented if the overall burden on imports is less than the overall burden on EU manufacturing. This in turn requires measures to prevent the absorption of any costs by exporting producers or the sending of low carbon footprint goods to the EU and diverting high carbon footprint goods to markets with standards lower than the EU.\nGATT Article III\nIn relation to the cost burden, GATT Article III provides that there should be no discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. In other words, the carbon cost burden on imported goods should not be in excess of the carbon cost burden on like or substitutable/competitive EU products.\nThe exact carbon cost burden on an EU manufacturer for a particular good at any one time will always be a matter of fact. This implies that some sort of mechanism will be required to set the exact cost burden on the imported good. The import cost burden mechanism cannot operate so as to allow carbon leakage and therefore must also address the wider carbon reduction objectives.\nGATT Article XX\nIf a border measure which reflects a high level of climate ambition is in breach of GATT Article Ill, recourse to the exceptions in GATT Article XX will be required.\nThe key to a successful recourse to GATT Article XX is that any discrimination or trade restriction is done for authentic environment/health related considerations.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nTo come within GATT XX, the border measure must be shown:\ne to be necessary to protect human, animal, plant health (GATT XX(b)) e to relate to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT XX(g))\nAnd, if it passes either one of these first two tests, the chapeau of GATT XX provides:\ne It must not be a disguised restriction on international trade, or e Constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail.\nAn import cost burden mechanism is in line with the general legal requirement (reflected in the EU Outokumpu Oy case from April 1998 — Case C-213/96) that there must always be a mechanism that allows importers to show the actual conditions of the imported good.\nA mechanism of this nature would have to allow, for example, adjustments for countries participating in the EU’s ETS or its equivalent or for products that have already incurred specific costs.\nBurden of Proof\nIt need not be problematic from a WTO law perspective if the burden of proof both in relation to actual emissions and actual costs already incurred is on the importer.\nFlexibility for EU importers at company and/or country level\nGATT Article | prohibits discrimination between imports based on origin. Thus exempting, per se, imports from certain origins on the basis of carbon policies could breach this provision. However, Canada-Autos (February 2000) indicates that origin neutral measures which evaluate production processes in particular countries could be WTO compatible. This reasoning might well apply to a country that participated in the EU’s ETS or had an equivalent ETS system in place.\nEU policy seeks to reduce emissions by placing limitations and costs on emissions. This results in a cost burden per tonne of steel. The border measure must materially\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\ncontribute to this objective of limiting and costing emissions while seeking, as far as possible, not discriminating between imported and domestically produced goods.\nIf, in the production of the imported good, emission limitations or costs have already been incurred, whether those limitations or costs are due to third country public policy or individual company policy, then those limitations and costs must be taken into consideration in ensuring no discrimination on the goods themselves within GATT Article II] and on the origin within GATT Article |, so long as to do so would not undermine the EU’s overall climate policy.\nIt is reasonable to think of border cost burden mechanism that, when evaluating the emissions of a particular good, would provide that if the good came from a particular origin (whether country or company) a pre-evaluated amount of emissions (or cost) might be provisionally recognised (so as to facilitate trade and ease of border evaluation). This evaluation would have to be based on verified evidence rather than political assumptions and a mechanism to contest the provisional evaluation should be available to importers.\nRisk of Absorption and Source Shifting\nA third country producer could export its low carbon footprint steel to the EU and sell its high carbon footprint steel on the domestic market or in markets with lower climate ambitions than the EU (source shifting).\nOr a third country producer could absorb the EU carbon costs imposed at the border if the percentage of exports to the EU as against its total sales was low and there were no carbon emission costs on the other volumes not exported to the EU (absorption).\nA border measure that addresses absorption and source shifting need not, per se, be incompatible with WTO rules. At the same time, it can be complex. GATT Article III applies to the good traded rather than total production of all the goods from the country of origin or the manufacturer. This indicates that a provision in the border measure addressing total company or country emissions so as to avoid source shifting and absorption would have to be designed to come within GATT XX.\nIt can be expected that addressing absorption and source shifting will require the development of a sophisticated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. These types of mechanisms are common in trade and can be seen in trade defence instruments or in ensuring the health and safety of foods and agricultural products.\nSI\nNctm\nLuther. GIDE\nGIDE LOYRETTE NOUVEL\nAbatement costs\nAbatement investment costs are incurred today with the object of a future benefit. Given the view of the WTO Appellate Body in Brazil-Retreaded Tyres (cited above) the legality of one part of a border measure addressing the issue of abatement and which made a material contribution to the EU’s carbon reduction policy does not appear to be per se incompatible with WTO law. Compatibility will depend on the issues of material contribution and necessity.\nTo the extent that EU law requires abatement or sets specific carbon reduction targets for specific products these policies could be reflected in the border measure.\nTransition and complexity\nThere is nothing inherently incompatible with WTO law if the EU’s carbon border measure is phased-in over time and is made up of a variety of elements.\nThe transition to carbon neutrality can also be complex and the fact of complexity does not make it WTO incompatible. This could see the possibility of evolution of the two types of carbon leakage policies (addressing emissions in imports and avoiding the flight of manufacturing) independently of each other if there is an environmental justification for such difference within the EU’s high level of ambition.\nHVUROFER\nThe European Steel Association\nANNEX TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT EU ETS STATE AID GUIDELINES\nTHE EU STEEL INDUSTRY IS AT HIGH RISK OF CARBON LEAKAGE\nEven though the steel sector (NACE 2410) is included in Annex | of the draft Guidelines as eligible for compensation, the study by ADE and Compass Lexecon (consultants’ study) at page 33 classifies the sector only at medium risk. As we do not have access to the underlying data of this classification, we would like to make the following remarks, which indicate that also the steel sector should be considered at high risk:\nThe indirect emission intensity (indirect emissions/Gross Value Added) of the steel sector (which in the consultants’ study is defined as more relevant than trade intensity) is higher than three out of four sectors defined at medium-high risk (leather clothes, inorganic chemicals and pulp).\ne\nSince the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is highly affected by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator among the 8 eligible sectors.\nAmong the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has the second lowest profitability indicator Gross\nOperating Surplus on Turnover) according to Eurostat.\nSteel is one of the most traded goods worldwide and, at the same time, the one where the large majority of anti-dumping investigations have been initiated by G20 countries’. This is a clear sign of the fact that the sector is suffering from trade distortions at global level.\nAs aresult of the combined effect of increasing imports and decreasing exports, the EU became net importer in terms of quantities in 2013 and in terms of value in 2015. In 2014, the EU imported 26,3 million tonnes of steel while, in 2019 the imports were 34,7 million tonnes.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports even if there is no significant trading in official international exchanges.\nThe anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are punctual measures limited to one product at the time and per country. They address unfair trade practices and aim only at re-establishing a level playing field but do not prevent those countries from exporting large quantities to the EU.\nGiven the massive global overcapacities in the steel sector, once the injurious imports from a country are limited thanks to the anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures, other countries can easily replace them (as widely occurred recently).\nIn adopting ex officio the EU steel safeguard measures in reaction to the US 232 tariffs, the EU has recognised that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not enough to tackle the massive trade diversion deriving from US tariffs.\nHowever, the EU steel safeguard are exceptional, temporary measures to expire on 1 July 2021 (hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment). They aim at mitigating the risk that trade flows are diverted from the US to the EU.\nUnfortunately, due to the design of the mechanism (i.e. reference volume of imports, liberalisation, carry over, etc.), in 2019 the EU steel safeguard measures have not prevented multiple, severe, market disruptions in the EU. Weak steel demand, increased protectionism worldwide (leading to trade diversion) and worsening overcapacities caused more than 15,000 jobs redundancies in 2019.\nThe steel industry is highly affected the fuel-electricity exchangeability which causes the risk of increasing direct emissions (both within the EU and internationally) if indirect costs compensation is not effective.\nA study by NERA Consulting commissioned by EUROFER has clearly concluded that due to the market characteristics, the steel sector cannot pass through unilateral carbon costs without loss of market shares.\n1\nReport on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019\nhttp://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 * B-1000 Brussels * Belgium 5 5\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\n1. Introduction\nThe EU ETS Guidelines are an essential element of the legal framework that aims at preventing the risk of carbon leakage. In previous publications of the European Commission (e.g. 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the post 2020 EU ETS Directive proposal, and 2018 Impact assessment accompanying the Communication “A Clean Planet for All’’), the steel sector had been identified at highest risk of carbon leakage.\nFinancial compensation of indirect costs is essential for both the electric arc furnace (EAF), which has very high electro-intensity because it uses large amount of electricity to melt and recycle scrap, and the integrated route, which consumes electricity produced from the combustion of recovered waste gases generated unavoidably by the steel making process. Financial compensation for this case is explicitly mentioned in recital 13 of the post 2020 EU ETS Directive in order to preserve the incentive to recover waste gases, since free allocation is granted only partially for waste gases’ emissions.\n2. Indirect carbon leakage indicator and indirect costs’ impact without labour costs\nFor consistency with the free allocation rules and the ETS Directive, the indirect carbon leakage assessment indicator (ICLI) is based on the multiplication between trade intensity and indirect emissions intensity (kg CO2 indirect emissions/ € GVA). In this assessment, the steel sector (NACE 2410) has the second last value, which is then reflected also in the red-amber-green (RAG) assessment in the consultants’ study.\n|\n=\nIndirect emission\nIndirect carbon\nTrade\nleakage indicator intensity\nintensity\nRAG rating\n[kg CO2 / EUR GVA]\nINace |\nCCST 203-2025 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015 |\n[2442 [Aluminium production | _—|_—_—'1,060_|_—35,20% 3,011] Medium-high _|\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\n0,522\n48, 10%\n1,085\nMedium\nSource: consultants’ study\nThis assessment is highly influenced by the use of the GVA in the denominator of the indirect emission intensity. Since the steel industry is very labour intensive, the GVA is affected significantly by the labour costs. If labour costs are excluded from the calculation (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector has the third highest indirect carbon leakage indicator and the second highest indirect emissions intensity among the 8 eligible sectors.\nThe European Steel Association\n1920\nIndirect emission\nTrade\nleakage indicator\nintensity\n(GOS instead of GVA)\nintensity\n[kg CO2 / EUR GOS]\nINAcE | 203-2015 | 2013-2015 | 2013-2015\n1411 |Manufacture ofleatherclothes|__—_—3,029_— | 83,00% | 3,650\n2443\n1711 Manufacture of pulp\nefined petroleum products\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nSimilarly, the section 3.1.1 on aid intensity and degressivity of the consultants’ study assesses the impact of indirect costs (with a carbon price of 25€/t) after 75% compensation taking into account the GVA. In such assessment, among the 8 eligible sectors, the steel industry has around the fourth indirect costs impact (after 75% compensation), which is comparable to the sectors with the lower impact (blue bars below). Yet, if labour costs are excluded from the denominator (i.e. the GVA is replaced by GOS), the steel sector have very clearly the second highest impact (orange bars below), with a large difference above the remaining sectors.\nIndirect CO2 costs after 75% compensation\n5,4%\n5,0%\n4,3%\n4,0%\n2,9%\n3,0%\n2,3%\n2,1%\n2,0%\n1,9\n1,8%\n:\n1,39\n1,3%\n1,6%\n0 99\n0,99\n0,89\n0,9\n1,0%\n0,7\n0,69\n0,0%\n&\nxe)\nny\nCo\nSS\nov\n<2\nNo\nSS\nx2\n¥\ns\nNS\nRS\n<O\nSs\n<O\ngf\n&\ney\nS\nR\nNs\nSy\nBS\nAS\nNe’\nSS\n6\nRo\ny\nRNa\n»\nwv?\n&\nae\n&\ns”?\n<8\nSs\nKO\n‘Sy\ne\nPS\nwv?\n&\n<O\noe\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GVA\n@ Indirect CO2 costs/GOS\nSource: recalculations based on consultants’ study (GOS figures from Eurostat)\nThe above analysis is even more relevant if one considers the profitability of the eligible sectors.

Overcapacities: a structural problem of the steel industry\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis generated by the trade spill overs of Chinese excess capacity, the EU activated its trade defence tools to defend EU industry from unfair trade for a total of 25 trade defence measures. However, these efforts address the effects of global overcapacity on trade — not its root causes.\nTo that effect, the EU led the December 2016 creation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, bringing together 33 economies — all G20 members plus interested OECD countries.\nThe global surplus in steelmaking capacity has slightly decreased since the Forum's creation but in 2018 is still more than 500 million metric tonnes, an alarmingly high-level equivalent to one quarter of the world's total capacity. This structural surplus floods world markets as soon as there is a cyclical downturn - with yet again a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs.\nGLOBAL CRUDE STEELMAKING CAPACITY (IN MILLION TONNES)\nGlobal overcapacity\n—@— = CAPACITY MN capacity-probuction GaP\nwas around\n2500\n550\nmillion\n2000\ntonnes\n1500\nin 2018 -\n1000\nequivalent to almost\n500 usS8sSSeeisa 25'b\nof total global steel\n°\nproduction capacity.\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018(E)\nSource: OECD\nOn 26 October 2019, the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity had to take a decision on the renewal of the Global Forum’s three-year mandate. On that occasion, there was an overwhelming support by members to continue working to address the persistent global excess Capacity plaguing the global steel sector. However, China was the only country that chose not to join the consensus and hence decided to step out of the Forum. The Global Forum welcomed China's efforts to reduce capacity, but equally identified the need for further reductions and the elimination of subsidies causing overcapacity, underlining that these actions are essential to prevent another major global steel crisis. Despite China leaving, the platform remains open to all interested OECD and G20 members, which continue to be invited to join discussions. However, without China — producing more than half of the world’s steel - the effectiveness of the Global\nForum is seriously undermined.\nThe latest available information (as of 31 December 2018) suggests that global steelmaking capacity (in nominal crude terms) remained nearly unchanged in 2018, following declines in 2016 and 2017. However, information on announced investment projects suggests that, globally, 87.8mmt of gross capacity additions are currently underway (mainly in Asia and middle East) and could come on\nThe European Steel Association\nstream during the three-year period of 2019-21. An additional 22.4 million tonnes of capacity additions are currently in the planning stages for possible start-up during the same time period.\nFigure 1.

Trade defence measures\nAccording to the last OECD Report on G20 Trade and Investment Measures, since 2017, metal products accounted for the largest share of initiations (by G20 members) of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations across the reporting periods (July-December 2017; January-June 2018; July-December 2018 and January-June 2019).\nThe metal’s sector accounted for a total of 102 anti-dumping initiations from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2019. Overall, steel products (HS chapters 72 and 73) accounted for the large majority of these investigations (76 out of 102) -75%\nWhile steel is a highly-trade good, it is also the one which is subject to the highest amount of anti- dumping measures, clearly showing that the sector is suffering from trade distorting practices.\nThe large number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases clearly indicates that the EU steel sector is a price taker as the EU market price is inevitably affected by dumped imports. This is also confirmed by the close relationship between steel prices in the EU and in other regions (see graphs below). Most importantly, such relationship remains very close also when trade measures are adopted, clearly indicating that the EU steel market is constantly affected by the global dynamics.\nRe-bars: domestic prices in different regions\n5 1,000\n—Europe —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nPERSE ERE ESE SE wr a Ps Bs 2\n+ - # v #\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nReports on G20 Trade and Investment measures, OECD, November 2019 http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/22nd-Report-on-G20-Trade-and-Investment-Measures.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\nRe-bars: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n40%\n—-Europe —USA\n30%\n20%\ni)\n10%\nay, ,\nA\n\\ IN} \\\\\niD\nAYy\n0%\n\\ /)\niy A ai TN AV\nV}\n\\ 7 V\nPe) a/\nV\n-10%\n-20%\nVe,\n-30%\n—China —tTurkey —Russia\n-\n0%\n<a\n-S%\n-\n8 :\nSource: SBB; Indices on Re-Bars, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: domestic prices in different regions\nVv\nc« 1,000\n—-EUROPE —US —China —Turkey —Russia\n900\n800\n700\n600\nsoo\n400\n300\n200\n100\nfe)\nwo\nwo\nwo\not\n~\n-\n°c\nSel\na\nwt\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n-\n-\n-_\n-\n-_\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nHot rolled coils: monthly variations of domestic prices in different regions\n35%\n——EUROPE ——-US —=—CHINA -——Turkey Russia\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\ni\\\n10%\n/\n\\\\ ‘A\no\\\nS%\nI\nAD\n/\nv\nV\nf/\n\\\nY\\y K]\n(\nDN\n,\\\nhy\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n“a let\nSource: SBB; Indices on HRC, domestic markets; qualities normalised to B500B/C/similar; ex-works/-stocks\nThe European Steel Association\na. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties: a punctual reaction to unfair trade practices\nWhile the massive overcapacities in the steel sector are clearly a structural issue which will not be solved in the short term (especially with China stepping out of the Global Forum), trade defence measures are punctual, specific measures, which are limited to a precise product scope and to some specific countries.\nAnti-dumping/anti-subsidy measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's investigation justifies it. When it comes to anti-dumping, the Commission’s investigation checks if:\n1 There is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned; 2 The European industry concerned suffers 'material injury’; 3 There is a causal link between dumping and injury; 4 Putting measures in place is not against the European interest (hereafter Union interest).\nIt is only when all four conditions are met that the Commission may put anti-dumping measures in place. As mentioned in point 4, in its evaluation, the Commission assesses whether measures in place don’t harm the European interest. This is not a mandatory provision under the WTO Anti- Dumping Agreement. In fact, the European Union’s legislation contains certain provisions which could be defined as “WTO plus”, meaning that they are not mandatory under WTO law. Two examples are: the Union interest and the lesser duty rule (LDR). With regards to the LDR, it is worth noting that the jurisdictions which apply it can decide to impose duties lower than the margin of dumping when these are sufficient to remove injury.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, it seems clear that trade defence measures are last resort tools.\nThe aim of the European Commission is always to struck a balance between domestic industry, importers and users. The reason why the EU imposes those measures is simply to seek a level playing field and tackle unfair trade practices, while considering the interest of the EU as a whole.\nThe effectiveness of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties can be undermined by the fact that if the imports of a certain product from a certain country decrease following the imposition of the duties, it is not always the case that EU producers will benefit from it. In fact, in a situation of massive overcapacities, the market share that China (and/or other countries whose products are subject to trade defence measures) used to hold has often been replaced by other exporting countries.\nSome examples can be found below:\ne Hot Rolled Flat (HRF): The recent surge of Turkish imports is higher than that of Chinese HRF imports back in 2015-2016 when the EU imposed dumping duties on Chinese based on a threat of injury.\nThe Impact of Turkish HRF Imports is Even Higher than That of Chinese Imports\nal o\ni\nme |\n00 MT =\n,—\nf EU HRF\n18\nf EU HRF impc\nSource: Eurostat\nThe European Steel Association\nHot Rolled Flat (HRF): similarly, the imposition of AD duties on Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran and Brazil was followed by a surge of imports from other countries, notably Turkey, India, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan.\nHot Rolled Flat Imported Volumes (tonnes)\n14.000.000\nApril 2017 Imposition of AD duties\n12.000.000\n10.000.000\n8.000.000\n6.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.000.000\ni)\nY 2016\n== Sum Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, Brazil = Sum Turkey, India, S.

EU Steel Safeguard Measures: a temporary solution to exceptional circumstances\nThe EU has reacted to U.S. 232 measures by introducing safeguard measures to defend the domestic industry by imposing provisional measures in July 2018 and definitive measures in February 2019: in doing so, the Commission assessed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures were not sufficient to address the huge import increase deriving from trade diversion.\nThe safeguards are a justified trade policy response to import surges caused by external factors.\nThe definitive\n26 steel\nand\nremain in force for\nmeasures cover product categories are expected to three years, hence till 1 July 2021. Hence, they are not relevant for the EU ETS phase 4 under discussion in this assessment.\nWhen imposing the EU steel safeguard measures, the Commission recognized that the EU steel industry “is still in a fragile and vulnerable position” and considered that traditional import flows should have been maintained as far as possible. The measures are indeed aimed at tackling the trade diversion following the imposition of the US measures, not to close the EU market. While the\nThe European Steel Association\nUS imposed a 25% tariff from the first tonne without granting duty-free volumes to the European Union, the Commission decided to apply the 25% duty only to imported quantities above a reference historical level because it considered that, with safeguard measures established under the form of a Tariff Rate Quota, effective competition between imports and the Union industry would have been maintained, and that the risk of general price increases and of any shortage would have been avoided (Recital 136 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 of 31 January 2019 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products).\nHow does the EU steel safeguard work?\na The quota of imports without the 25% duty is based on the average volume data from 2015-\n2017. This quota increased by 5% in February 2019, 3% in July 2019 and is scheduled to\nincrease by another 3% in July 2020. This expansion of the quota size is independent of the growth of the overall EU steel market. The quota structure takes the form of a set of tariff-rate quotas, based on the average volume of traditional imports over 2015-17 plus 5%. It is important to stress that this 5% increase which occurred in February 2019 is an adjustment the EU has foreseen, but which is not mandatory under WTO rules (unlike the liberalisation). The key assumptions underlying the 5% increase in quota volumes in February 2019 were that consumption was likely to experience double digit growth and that, accordingly, the Union industry was unlikely to suffer serious harm if imports increased by slightly more than 4%. This assumption of buoyant demand and growing consumption was based on a claim by users that EUROFER thought unrealistic at the time. Unfortunately for the sector, users’ claims were unfounded and the market has not grown at all as EUROFER had expected since the beginning of 2019:\nEU Real Steel ee Consumption (% year-on-year) Only once the quota is exceeded, a 25% tariff applies to other imported products, with major traditional steel importers retaining their own country-specific quotas. All other countries are assigned to a product-specific, ‘residual quota’ pool. In contrast to the country specific quotas, this residual quota is divided into quarters. Developing countries that have less than 3% import share are excluded from the measures while their volumes are counted in the average 2015-17 quota levels and are available to the included countries and thus artificially increase the quota even further). Imports of stainless-steel flat products from Indonesia were originally exempted from measures as Indonesia is considered a “developing country”, and imports were below the 3% threshold. This however changed quickly. At the time the Commission’s definitive regulation was published, Indonesia had already largely exceeded by far the 3% threshold (28.5% for SSHR and 9% for SSCR). In the future, the same situation might occur with other countries which have declared themselves as “developing”. When a quarterly quota is under-utilised, the volume is rolled over into the next quarter to avoid shortages. Hence, in the context of stagnating demand, historical volumes can be\n3\nEUROFER Economic and Steel Market Outlook 2020-2021, January 2020,\nhttp://www.eurofer.org/Issues%26Positions/Economic%20Development%20%26%20Steel%20 Market/REPORT%20- %20Economic%20and%20Steel%20 Market%20Outlook%20-%20 Quarter%201,%202020.pdf\nThe European Steel Association\n10\neasily shifted and used by importers as soon as EU demand resumes, thus gaining further market shares\nDespite the presence of the EU steel safeguard measures, multiple market disruptions and production cuts have occurred in 2019 in European facilities, as indicated below\na EU crude steel production in 2019 decreased by 9.8 million tonnes compared to 2018 ( -6% y-o-y).

Following Mexico’s exclusion from the U.S. import tariff, the U.S. DOC has now initiated a new U.S. anti-dumping investigation on certain rebar to address circumvention of existing duties on general rebar. In October 2019, the Gulf Cooperation Council initiated a steel safeguard investigation covering flat and long carbon steel. Mexico extended in September 2019 its temporary import tariff of 15% to last through 2024. Turkey increased certain steel import tariffs from 10% to 30% (April 2019). Malaysia imposed anti-dumping duties on coated sheet from China and Vietnam (March 2019). Morocco launched a steel safeguard (May 2019). India imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of coated flat steel from China, South Korea and Vietnam (July 2019). Vietnam initiated an anti-dumping investigation on cold-rolled coil imports from China (September 2019). Indonesia initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of coated sheet from China and Vietnam (August 2019) and an anti-dumping investigation on imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products from China and Malaysia (October 2019). Egypt imposed safeguard tariffs on rebar and wire rod (Oct 2019). China imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled sheets and strips from the EU, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia (July 2019). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on rebars from Singapore and Turkey (January 2020). Malaysia imposed definitive antidumping duties on cold-rolled nonalloy steel from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam (December 2019). India initiated a countervailing duty investigation on flat products of stainless steel from Indonesia (October 2019). Thailand initiated an antidumping investigation on HDG cold-rolled painted steel (October 2019). Vietnam imposed definitive antidumping duties on pre-painted steel sheets and strips from China and Korea (October 2019). Canada initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of corrosion-resistant flat products from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam (November 2019).\nMoreover, U.S. steel imports took a nosedive after June 2019. From June 2019 to January 2020, imports were 3.0 million tonnes lower than the same period in the previous year, and 6.3 million tonnes lower than the same period before the imposition of the Section 232 import tariff. This material has to go somewhere - but it is increasingly blocked from third countries by TDIs. Increased exports to the EU are therefore likely.

Abatement potential and fuel and electricity substitutability\nThe last two parameters of the RAG assessment are the abatement potential and the fuel electricity\nsubstitutability. Due to the high relevance of energy costs, steel production is very energy efficient\nand very close to thermodynamic limits. Hence, it has very limited abatement potential.\nWith regard to the fuel-electricity substitutability, the consultants’ study (page 77) states: “To determine the overall RAG rating, we consider first if there is variability between undertakings on fuel used for production. If there is no variability, then there is no risk on this criterion. If variability exists, the risk on the fuel and electricity substitutability criteria only exists if the sector is included on the Carbon Leakage List for Phase IV, i.e. the sector receives compensation for its direct emissions. If the RAG score is Red for the fuel and electricity substitutability, then the overall RAG rating performed on the previous three criteria will be increased to a higher score reflecting a higher risk of carbon leakage”. On this point, table 7 (page 76) of the consultants’ study does not seem fully consistent as it attributes a green category to a sector with high substitutability in case compensation was granted in the past. In this way, a sector like steel has its RAG assessment downgraded at a lower risk. Yet, since this is a forward-looking assessment, it should consider the situation where a sector with high substitutability would not receive compensation in the future, in which case its overall RAG rating should be increased.\nIn the case of steel, the substitutability between fuel and electricity can manifest in different forms, notably:\ne Firstly, within the electric arc furnace (EAF), where fuel-electricity substitutability has been recognised in the scope of the carbon and high alloy steel ETS benchmarks. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would risk increasing fuel consumption, hence direct emissions. Secondly, between the EAF route and the integrated route, in particular if the international dimension is taken into account. Insufficient compensation of indirect costs would undermine the competitiveness of EU EAF producers against integrated route producers in third countries that still produce long products that in the EU are largely manufactured in EAF. That would cause increase of total emissions at global level.\n13\nThe European Steel Association"

European Commission Vice- President Frans Timmermans is responsible for fleshing out its details, which should happen within 100 days of the new Commission taking office.\nTalking about the European Green Deal during his hearing before the European Parliament, Frans Timmermans said there would be “a carbon border tax to level the playing field for European products if other countries do not go as far as us, or refuse to go in the right direction\" and \"if you don't want to do that [take part in the emission trading system] we have no other option but to correct this difference in carbon footprint at the border with a tax.\"\nSince the introduction of an instrument to shape the Carbon Border Adjustment seems very likely, BusinessEurope has created a task force ‘Trade and Climate’. In preparation for an upcoming meeting of the task force, FEB is considering witch questions will need to be answered during the impact assessment that the European Commission has announced about the Carbon Border Adjustment instrument.\n2 Questions\n2.1 Objective\nIs the instrument the European Commission intends to introduce primarily aimed at:\ne reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Europe; e reducing greenhouse gas emissions outside Europe; e protecting European industry from a competitive disadvantage as a result of CO2 emissions (creating a level playing field for companies established in the EU); or e establishing alternative financing for the EU?\nThe proposed instrument must undergo an impact assessment. Regardless of the instrument's prime objective, the impact assessment must ascertain its impact on emissions inside and outside Europe, the competitiveness of European companies and the European budget.\nIn addition, the European Commission must also assess the risk of trade reprisals (retaliation) by third countries and, where necessary, be able to quantify them, too.\n2.2 Alternatives\nDid the European Commission only consider the possibility of a Border Adjustment Tax when developing the instrument it intends to introduce, or were other options for realising a Border Carbon Adjustment considered?\n2.3 ETS\n2.4 Imports and exports\n2.6 EU economy\nVBO FEB\nFederation of Enterprises in Belgium\nThe emission trading system (ETS) is the tool developed by the European Union to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by industry in Europe. What impact will the Commission's proposal have on the ETS?\nDoes the Commission intend to adapt the ETS to imports (remember, the ETS applies to industry, not products)? If so, how will the overall number of quotas in the ETS be adjusted? Will products destined for export outside the EU henceforth be exempted from the ETS or removed from the system? Such a system would mean shifting the focus of climate policy from production (where emissions occur) to consumption (where the products that caused emissions are consumed).\nThe ETS applies to activities from Annex 1 of the EU ETS Directive (2003/87/EC). Will the proposed instrument therefore only apply to imported goods produced via foreign activities corresponding to those listed in Annex 1 of the EU ETS Directive?\nCompanies can make use of free emission allowances within the ETS. Will it be possible to retain those allowances under the proposed instrument?\nEU climate policy is now aimed at reducing emissions within the EU, regardless of whether goods manufactured in the EU are consumed there or subsequently exported. If importers to Europe from countries with a less restrictive climate policy, or none at all, end up having to pay an EU levy to thereby cancel out their cost advantage over EU producers, EU exporters would have to be reimbursed for costs incurred as a result of EU climate policy, to cancel out their competitive disadvantage compared to local producers. How might exporters be compensated and how much will that cost?\n2.5 Emissions stemming from imported products\nHow will the EU calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of imported goods? Will it only take account of the energy emissions occurring during the production of the imported goods? If not, which other (direct and/or indirect) emissions will be taken into account?\nMight the proposed instrument end up pushing the importing of goods higher up the value ladder? What impact would this have on the European economy? And how would it change greenhouse gas emissions by importing countries?\nWill the proposed instrument only take account of the quantity of energy used to produce the imported goods or consider other factors as well?\nVBO FEB\nFederation of Enterprises in Belgium\n2.7 Compliance with trade agreements\nHow will the EU guarantee a level playing field for European industry if it makes the implementation of the Paris Agreement a prerequisite for trade agreements with third countries or a condition for launching FTA negotiations?\n2.8 Compliance of the proposed instrument (CBAM) with WTO rules\nHow will the European Commission ensure that this border-adjusted measure (BAM) complies with WTO rules? And in particular with:\nI Article | GATT - Most-favoured nation treatment - a clause prohibiting discrimination between products exported by third countries. Il Article Il & Ill GATT - To comply with Articles II.2 and III.2 GATT, the BAT should be imposed on a ‘like’ product and be considered equivalent — at least not in excess — to an internal tax, whether applied directly or indirectly. 1 Can the ETS system be considered an (indirect) internal tax under WTO rules? 2 Can CO2 emissions be considered an input that is physically incorporated in the product? Which benchmark and CO2 pricing methodology will be used to calculate the adjustment mechanism ? 4 Will the foreign product subjected to a BAM be considered a ‘like’ product? Article Ill GATT - National treatment on internal taxation and regulation - clause requiring similar treatment for national and imported products, as well as prohibiting protectionist measures. There is a clear link here with the ultimate objective of the BAM, namely establishing a \"level playing field\" or reducing COz emissions. Il Article XX GATT - General exceptions - clause providing for exceptions for measures taken to protect human life (b) or conserve natural resources (g) (if similar measures are taken at national level)."

FES] welcomes the possibility to provide comments to the Inception Impact Assessments and would like to take this opportunity to present its view on the different options put forward by the European Commission.\nFESI is strongly committed to sustainability and it believes that taking action to mitigate climate change is of crucial importance in the years to come. The sporting goods industry is an industry that already takes the environmental impact of its products and supply chain seriously. Many FESI members have signed the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, whereby they voluntary commit to setting and meeting internal targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency in line with the Paris Agreement and rapidly scaling up energy efficiency and emission reduction programmes; to working collaboratively to develop emission- reduction pathways, work programmes, and tools necessary to achieve their emission reduction targets; and to investing in sustainable production and related technologies. Some FES| members have also signed The Fashion Pact, committing —- among others — to stopping global warming and supporting the efforts under the UN Fashion Industry Charter.\nType of policy instrument\nThe European Union is currently deploying two key trade policy instruments to ensure a free and fair trade: progressive free trade agreements, with ambitious and binding trade and sustainable development chapters, and the GSP. The EU’s trade policy is driving positive change, already contributing to lowering the environmental and social impact throughout supply chains.\nThe WTO compatibility of any instrument chosen is of utmost importance. The recent retaliatory measures targeting specific industries as a result of incompatible measures by various actors ought to be avoided. It is also important to underline that such measure shall not become a gateway for protectionism at the expenses of companies operating in the EU. Footwear and apparel imports are already burdened with some of the highest tariffs in the EU and across the world, especially when compared to other consumer products. FESI advises against adding additional customs duties on the import of such products, since it will put an increased burden on consumers.\nPage 2 of 2\nFinally, policy coherence is crucial: there are currently inconsistencies within the EU’s tariff structure. In some instances, the current tariff structure penalises the use of more sustainable materials in favour of less sustainable ones. Before considering any additional customs duty, FESI urges the Commission to address this incoherence.\nMethodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported\nproducts\nFESI believes that assessing different methodological approaches to evaluate the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products will be essential in order to find the right tools to support the EU’s objectives. While the EU ETS system is mentioned as a potential option, FES! recommends not to consider it as a one- size-fits-all solution by default. Alternative methodological approaches need to be identified and assessed, especially for sectors which are currently not covered by the EU ETS but might in the future fall under the scope of an EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nSectoral scope\nThe selection of sectors subject to a potential EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will be an essential part of ensuring the effectiveness of this new measure. The risk of carbon leakage should be properly assessed, and the scope of the measure should prioritise sectors where the risk is higher. This will ensure that the initiative meets its purpose while avoiding imposing additional burden on other sectors.\nIt is important that the Commission combines any policy instrument together with measures to support the transition towards a carbon neutral continent. FESI recommends the Commission take technology-neutral measures and market-based incentives and create the space and opportunities for investments, research and innovation.\nFinally, FESI strongly recommends the Commission carry out a thorough impact assessment. This shall be based ona study; stakeholders shall be properly consulted for and involved in such study, by also giving them enough time to provide comments and feedback. FES! will remain at full disposal for any enquiry the Commission might have.\nKKK\nFounded in 1960 FESI - the Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry represents the interests of approximately 2,400 sporting goods manufacturers (85% of the European market) through its 11 National Sporting Goods Industry Federations and its directly affiliated member companies. 70-75% of FESI's membership is made up of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.

Other options, which may be complementary to BCA should not be disregarded, including the creation of a framework that will lead to a market for low carbon products. Without such a market the tools available to the EU to implement the EU Green Deal will be incomplete.\nWe must remember that a number of options have been considered to address the risk of carbon leakage, with some being more mature and/or more tested than others, including:\ne Free allocation/compensation of indirect costs Internationalization of the carbon market through linking and the use of Article 6 Paris Agreement Border carbon adjustments Other potential options e Consumption charges: a charge that shifts the carbon price to consumers based on the weight and type of material in a final product e Contracts for difference: a financial mechanism to safeguard the profitability of low- carbon investments based on the amount of avoided carbon and a set carbon price\nERCST is currently considering these issues in much greater depth in a project entitled “Border Carbon Adjustments in the EU — Issues and Options” and will contribute to subsequent public consultations.\n-1-\nERCST\nRoundtable on\nClimate Change and\nSustainable Transition\nBorder carbon adjustments (BCAs) seek to alleviate the negative effects of uneven (asymmetrical) climate policies and may include imports and/or exempt exports. Ensuring that both these aspects are included in the examination is critical for the effectiveness and credibility of any approach being adopted.\nIn the same train of thought, it is important that both direct and indirect emissions are included in the examination that the European Commission is proposing.\nBCAs have three main objectives:\n- Prevent leakage of carbon emissions to jurisdictions with weaker policies; - Create a level playing field in competitive markets; - Incentivise trade partners to strengthen their own climate efforts.\nBeing clear on the objectives will ensure that there is a good basis for making choices when we enter the design phase of the chosen approach. In addition, many would regard the consideration of the BCA as having tactical or strategic justification. While there is always a balance, the primary consideration needs to be selecting an approach that meets the primary objectives, which will be more strategic, that is, that carbon leakage is avoided, including through a level playing field for competitiveness.\nOne additional remark that is triggered by the reference in Part A of the IIA to the fact that “the EU ETS Directive provides for this system (of free allocation) to continue at least until 2030”. This is important as it would seem to indicate that any BCA mechanism will not be made operational prior to 2030, or potentially operate in parallel. The current pandemic notwithstanding, some studies would indicate that the current approach of using free allocation may not be enough under certain scenarios in the second half of 2020s, as shown by Figure 1 and 2 below.\nFigure 1: Free Allocation demand/supply and CSCF under a high demand scenario for free allocation —\n50% EU headline target (ETS — ESR shares remains unchanged)\nMt\nMt\n800\n600\n400\n200\n50%\n200\n2021 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n2021 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n0%\nFigure 2: Free Allocation demand/supply and CSCF under a high demand scenario for free allocation — 50% EU headline target (ETS — ESR shares remains unchanged)\n-2-\nERCST\nRoundtable on\nClimate Change and\nSustainable Transition\nMt\n800\nMt\n600\n400\n200\n50%\n200\n2021 22 = 24 25 26 27 28 = =\n23\n29 30\n2021 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n0%\nmamActual allocation lm Use of surplus mam Use of flexibility\n= Cumulative flexibility available\nveBuild-up of surplus ——Cap allocation\n= Cumulative surplus available\nSource: BloombergNEF\nAlso, the CBAM must be seen as part-and-parcel of the EGD and cannot be approved as an afterthought or be backloaded. On the contrary, it should be frontloaded and be an integral part of the revamping of the EU ETS proposal package which is expected in June 2021.\n\nThe IIA identifies three building blocks that will be used to build policy options:\n1 Type of policy instrument. One important aspect that needs to be highlighted for examination and consideration is the dynamics between current and future approaches to address carbon leakage. This needs to be considered in light of the rationale for seeking new approaches — why and when would free allocation not be “fit for purpose” 2 Methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of imported products 3 Sectoral scope\nAs part of the “Border Carbon Adjustments in the EU — Issues and Options” study that ERCST is undertaking we have determined that any BCA needs to make design choices on a set of key features, each of which offers alternative options with varying trade-offs and implications for the achievement of the policy objectives of the BCA. Below is a list of the design aspects considered by ERCST in its analysis of BCA design options, which in some cases are a more granular outline of the items identified in IIA:\ne Objective: What is the overarching goal of the BCA (i.e. to mitigate emissions, secure competitiveness, etc.)? This aspect guides the selection of the following elements. Policy mechanism: Through what mechanism will the BCA be implemented? For example, will it be implemented by way of an extension of the EU ETS, or through a standalone tax or tariff? Trade coverage: Which direction of trade is affected by the BCA (i.e. imports, exports, or both)? Sectoral scope: What sectors or products will be covered by the BCA? Geographic scope: What countries or regions will be covered by the BCA? If exemptions are made, on what basis (including legal justification)? Emissions scope: What emissions will be covered by the BCA (direct, indirect, or both)? Estimation of embedded emissions: Will the carbon intensity of goods be calculated on the basis of actual reported and verified emissions, or based on sectoral or other benchmarks? Calculation of adjustment: On what basis will the policy differential the BCA adjusts for be determined between the European Union and covered third countries (i.e. which policies — if any\n-3-\nERCST\nRoundtable on\nClimate Change and\nSustainable Transition\n— will be taken into account when calculating that differential, e.g. only explicit carbon prices, or also other climate policies)? Use of revenue: How will the revenue generated from the BCA be used? Administrative aspects: How will the BCA be administered and rendered operational? Institutional governance: Can existing entities govern the BCA, or will a new institution have to be set up for routine management and decision making? Timeline: Will the BCA be rolled out quickly or in phases (for example, will it replace free allocation of allowances from the outset or gradually over time? Will it start with broad coverage or begin with one sector and expand over time)? Will it have a set expiration/sunset date?\nIn addition, in determining policy options, ERCST would also recommend focussing on five (5) criteria\nMeeting environmental objectives Addressing competitiveness concerns that may also lead to carbon leakage Legal feasibility 4 Technical feasibility 5 Administrative implications\nERCST would again like to emphasize the importance of ensuring that this is an exploration of means to achieve the stated objectives, and that the analysis and impact assessment should not be limited to adjustments at the border. We therefore urge that the a CBAM be compared with other approaches, with some being potentially more appropriate than others for some sectors.\nIn addition to assessing the economic impact of a carbon border adjustment mechanism versus the economic impacts of not implementing this mechanism (inaction), consideration should be given to alternatives to a CBAM, including consumptions charges and contracts for difference.\nFinally, ERCST would also like to highlight that the IIA is entirely focused on treatment of imports and that it is completely silent on any reference to the treatment of exports. This is not a minor issue.\n\nIn a globalized and interconnected world, it is important to analyse the socio-economic impacts of measures to address climate change, both domestic as well as international. When doing this analysis, ERCST suggests analysing the effects on all three pillars of sustainable development: the economic, environmental and social dimensions. They should also be quantified wherever possible. The analysis should also reflect both the positive as well as the negative, and both the intended and unintended impacts.\nDomestically, the impact assessment should be assessed in terms of impact on the economy as well as social impacts and how the just transition highlighted in the EGD will be impacted, and what measures are specifically put in place to deal with these impacts. In this context, triggering Article 30 of the EU ETS that looks at free allocation and how it deals with climate change policies and measures in other countries,\n-4-\nERCST\nRoundtable on\nClimate Change and\nSustainable Transition\nwill be an important element. Analysing how the BCA helps or hinders the creation of a market for low carbon products is another critical element of the impact assessment.\nInternationally, ERCST supports the intention of the Commission to analyse the expected socio-economic effects of the measure on third countries. Such assessments are an important element in ensuring that policy measures have the desired effect, both within and outside of the EU’s jurisdiction. The Commission should clarify the extent and how it intends to make this assessment (the methodology) as soon as possible. The analysis should be in line with UNFCCC provisions and made as granular as possible, e.g. by analysing the effects of the measure on other countries’ GHG emissions, on household income, or on individual sectors. To make the extent of the analysis manageable, ERCST would recommend focusing on a limited number of countries that are likely to be impacted by the CBAM. Vulnerable countries will likely vary over the policy options being considered e.g. which sectors are to be included in the policy measure will impact which countries can be expected to be impacted.\nIn determining which countries to include in the assessment, we suggest looking at two variables: 1. The value added (either as an absolute value, or relative to national GDP) of those sectors on which the CBAM will apply. 2 Intensity of a country’s trade with the EU.\nERCST has developed an additional methodology on how to do such an analysis, which is available from the ERCST project using Chile as a case study.*\nThe analysis of impacts should also address the use of revenues from any measures to address carbon leakage, and how these measures would interact with the provisions and ethos of the Paris Agreement. The success and international acceptability of such a mechanism will depend on how it addresses carbon leakage but also on the perception and its international political acceptability.\nThe analysis of the introduction of such a mechanism should focus largely on it being a cooperative approach and not a punitive one.\n\nCurrently, the only known carbon border adjustment mechanism in operation is applied to the power sector and is not applied at a national, but only a subnational border. While certain elements may be learned from this mechanism, it should be noted that the measures in California are inherently much simpler than any proposed mechanism that the EU would need to implement. Since these existing measures only capture Scope 2 emissions from power generation, there is no need to calculate embedded carbon content of complex supply chains. In addition, the EU CBAM may not have the same level of flexibility as these measures since it must adhere to international law.\n1 “Chile Case Response Measures Study” be found at https://ercst.or. reporting-on-the-impacts-of-response- can measures/\n-5-\nERCST\nRoundtable on\nClimate Change and\nSustainable Transition\nWe would again like to emphasize that the timeline would need to be legally frontloaded, not supplementary after the implementation of other measures (of EGD). The ambition for carbon neutrality needs to be matched with measures giving the industry chance to compete on the global market.\n-6-"

        "feedback": "ActionAid has produced a discussion paper which seeks to analyse the possible consequences or benefits for developing countries of a carbon border adjustment (CBA). While we recognise the possible rationale of the CBA from a climate objective perspective, in our discussion paper and in this feedback we focus more on social justice questions that may arise from a CBA, especially in relation to potential impacts on developing countries. Overall, we believe that the EU should seek to reduce carbon emissions associated with EU imports but other, potentially more effective tools than a CBA, such as import standards regulations, should also be considered alongside or even instead of a CBA.\n\nIf and when considering and designing the CBA, the EU should be guided by the following principles: \n\n1.\tGlobal environmental benefit: a CBA should be designed with global climate, environment and social objectives at its core, and should be flexible and nuanced enough to avoid causing perverse incentives in other countries that ultimately lead to more harm.\n2.\tPolicy Coherence for Development: a CBA should be coherent with development policy objectives and avoid any negative impact on the economies of developing countries, including via flanking measures.\n3.\tEquity: acknowledging the EU’s climate debt towards developing countries, as early-industrialised countries have already consumed most of the global carbon budget and must undertake steeper emission reductions to keep the planet under 1.5°C of average global warming.\n4.\tExisting commitments under the Everything But Arms initiative: special approach towards the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), in order to encourage their development, and consider impact on tariff-free access to the EU market where it exists. \n5.\tFairness and progressivity: considerations of progressivity must be applied to both the exporting developing countries as well as importing EU countries, to ensure the CBA does not create an additional, disproportionate burden on low-income households in Europe nor negative impacts on jobs and inequality in developing countries.\n\nBased on our analysis of potential impacts on developing countries, in our discussion paper we conclude that, if the EU does decide to go ahead with a CBA, it must thoroughly consider and take into consideration in the Impact Assessment the following challenges:\n\n●\tIs the CBA an effective tool to discourage carbon leakage or high GHGs in countries exporting to the EU? Are there other measures that could be more effective, e.g. import standards regulations? \n●\tIs the CBA able to recognise and adjust when other national policies, practices or regulations beyond domestic carbon prices and taxes have led to reduced GHG emissions and benefits to the environment?\n●\tFinding the right balance between respecting developing countries’ policy space, export needs and the EU’s policy coherence for development principle, and addressing the climate emergency by discouraging fossil fuel extraction and other carbon intensive economic activities in the EU and beyond. \n●\tHow to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalised by higher prices on essential products? \n●\tCan the revenues from the CBA be used in a fair way? \n      o The revenues accumulated in Europe via the CBA when imposed on products imported from developing countries could be transferred back to the countries concerned for their own budgetary goals, in order to strengthen their domestic resource mobilisation for financing of public services such as housing, education, health, environmental protection, or a just transition. \n     o  When a CBA applies to countries that are neither least developed countries nor developing countries, such as non-EU OECD countries, the proceeds could be used for redistribution within Europe to mitigate impacts on low-income households, or alternatively they could be directed to the UN’s Green Climate Fund as additional contributions.

The scope of the analysis is limited, and does not include a systemic critique of our globalised economic model.\nGlobalisation driven by trade and investment liberalisation over the last 30 years has deeply transformed our economies. The trade liberalisation regime has reached what UNCTAD calls hyperglobalisation’, leading to the integration of Global South countries into global economic systems, including through financialisation. More often than not, this integration has led to lowering of trade tariffs, de-industrialisation, and a push for an export-driven growth model. This model is largely based on the extraction of natural resources and labour from countries in the Global South, with limited benefits and numerous adverse impacts for local communities and the majority of the population in those countries. We believe it would be important, but beyond the scope of this briefing, to examine into more depth crucial questions that in fact should be the starting point of a deep rethink of hyperglobalisation: What would be a just, green and equitable development pathway for commodity dependent countries? How to reduce Europe’s footprint on global natural resources such as water (encompassed in imported products), land and minerals?\nAs initially suggested by the European Commission’, one of the main objectives of the EU with the CBA is to ensure European companies do not have competitive disadvantages compared to companies from countries with lax climate regulations, and to reduce the risk of carbon leakage. The objective of the CBA is to allow the EU to pursue ambitious climate objectives to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the Earth’s atmosphere, whilst ensuring that domestic efforts do not simply serve to drive production and GHGs emissions elsewhere.\nThe risk of carbon leakage is still being debated in research’, i.e. the risk that without the CBA, EU climate regulations might create perverse incentives for more imports from countries outside the EU which might be harming the environment, climate and rights. While we recognise the possible rationale of the CBA from a climate objective perspective, in this paper we do not undertake to assess climate impacts of this tool, which environmental organisations and academia may be best placed to do. Instead, this paper should be seen as a complementary analysis of socio-economic impacts to accompany analysis from a climate perspective. We are particularly focusing on social justice questions that may arise from a CBA, especially in relation to potential impacts on developing countries. Overall, we believe that the EU should seek to reduce carbon emissions associated with EU imports but other, potentially more effective tools than a CBA, such as import standards regulations, should also be considered alongside or even instead of a CBA.\n1 UNCTAD, 2019, Trade and Development Report: Financing a Global Green New Deal, available at: https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/tdr2019 en.pdf\n?

Policy Coherence for Development: a CBA should be coherent with development policy objectives and avoid any negative impact on the economies of developing countries, including via flanking measures. Equity: acknowledging the EU’s climate debt towards developing countries, as early- Industrialised countries have already consumed most of the global carbon budget and must undertake steeper emission reductions to keep the planet under 1.5°C of average global warming. Existing commitments under the Everything But Arms initiative: special approach towards the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), in order to encourage their social, environmental and economic development, and consider impact on tariff-free access to the EU market where it exists. Fairness and progressivity: considerations of progressivity must be applied to both the exporting developing countries as well as importing EU countries, to ensure the CBA does not create an additional, disproportionate burden on low-income households in Europe nor negative impacts on jobs and inequality in developing countries.\nCarbon border adjustments — in theory\nCarbon border adjustments (CBAs) work by either taxing an import so that it is taxed at the same level as the domestically produced product, or by crediting taxes on exports, in order not to impose an undue burden on the nationally produced product when it is known that the foreign product is not burdened by a similar tax, a carbon tax in this case.\nThe WTO is responsible for regulating when a border adjustment is admissible and when it is not through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For carbon border adjustments to be admissible, the tax applied (or credited) must be applied on both foreign and domestically produced products. The tax cannot unduly burden a foreign derived product. Moreover, the tax can only be applied on a product, not a process (also referred to as ‘taxes occultes’ or hidden taxes under WTO rules).“ Taxes occultes are not admissible under WTO regulations.\nFor example, a domestic tax on fuel can be legitimately applied on similar imported fuel, but a tax that is domestically applied on the energy consumed during an industrial process cannot be applied on similarly imported steel. This is because it is not straightforward to what extent the tax burdens the product — other factors could come into play, such as the technology employed, or the type of fuel burned to produce energy.\nIt follows from the above that, under WTO regulations, the following requirements are necessary for a carbon border adjustment to be admissible:\n4T. Falcdo, A Proposition for a Multilateral Carbon Tax Treaty, (2019), IBFD Online Books\n(i) An equivalent tax ought to be applied on a like-domestic product®. The concept of equivalence requires the tax rate of the national product and the imported product to be similar, so that no undue burden is applied on the foreign derived product in such a way that it might constitute a hindrance to trade. (ii) The tax must be levied on a product and not a process. Carbon taxes would therefore be admissible if employed both domestically and at the border, but the same might not hold true for energy taxes (if they apply in the production process, not to the finished product, see above) — although a conclusion cannot be reached until the details of the policy are revealed.\nA key challenge for the carbon border adjustment intended by the EU is whether it will be a mechanism able to differentiate between the environmental impact of products produced in different ways, or whether it will only be able to recognise whether the import is burdened by a domestic carbon tax in the exporting country.\nThe EU carbon border adjustment proposal\nThe European Commission’s flagship initiative or framework for its 2019-2024 mandate is the European Green Deal. Among various climate measures, the Green Deal foresees the introduction of a carbon border adjustment in selected sectors to protect European industry from loss in international competition and ensure that the price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content.°®\nThe proposal, as initially announced by the European Commission,’ is envisaged as a tool to ensure European companies do not have competitive disadvantages compared to companies from countries with lax climate regulations, and to prevent companies from simply moving carbon-intensive production to third countries to avoid the EU's strict environmental standards (also known as carbon leakage). Absent a revenue redistribution policy, the adjustment cost will ultimately be borne by the final consumer (in the EU) according to their consumption habits. Measures must be put in place to ensure that the tax is socially just and does not disproportionately impact low-income households.\nAccording to EU Tax Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, the carbon border adjustment “will have to be carefully crafted to exert political pressure on climate laggards to take action, to ensure that EU companies can compete on a level playing field, and to be fully compatible with rules of the World Trade Organization.”° Along with the carbon border adjustment, the Commission has also announced its intention to revise the existing Energy Taxation Directive, focusing on environmental issues.\nAs previously noted however, energy taxes tend to be production taxes and therefore a carbon border adjustment in respect of (or corresponding to) a domestic energy tax might not be admissible under\n5 Like-product is the WTO terminology to designate a similar product\n6 European Commission Communication, The European Green Deal, 2019, available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1576150542719&uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN\n7 Mission Letter of Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, 1 December 2019, available at:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/sites/comm-cwt2019/files/commissioner_mission_letters/mission-\nletter-paolo-gentiloni_en.pdf\n8 New EU Tax Commissioner Pledges Carbon Border Tax Law 360, 3 October 2019\n° Answers to the European Parliament questionnaire to the Commissioner-designate Paolo Gentiloni, September 2019, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20190927RES62447/20190927RES62447.pdf\nWTO rules. European Member States already applying domestic carbon taxes would be legally allowed, under WTO rules, to apply carbon border adjustments. However, for an EU-wide approach, there might be issues related to the disparity in tax rates administered by different European countries, which could lead to intra-EU competition.\nLikewise, there is a potential for double (or triple) taxation if the carbon tax, energy tax and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are applied over the same tax base. As it is now, most EU Member States applying unilateral carbon taxes do so on products not covered by the EU ETS (i.e. excluding the energy intensive sector covered by the EU ETS).\nTherefore, the introduction of a carbon border adjustment might also require the introduction of an EU-wide carbon tax, complementary and coherent with the EU Energy Taxation Directive and the EU ETS — a task that could prove difficult, considering the introduction of a carbon tax would require unanimous support and approval from all EU Member States.\nAn EU-wide carbon tax, applied at the upstream level (extraction or import of the carbon intensive product), and with a uniform carbon tax rate across the EU, would imply an increase in carbon tax rate for most EU countries. An extensive carbon tax could cover currently untaxed areas of the economy, such as maritime transport and international aviation (through the taxation of kerosene). However, social considerations will need to be taken into account to ensure that the cost of the carbon tax does not disproportionately fall on lower-income households, especially for products and services for which there are no sustainable alternatives currently available and accessible to them.\nConsidering the political difficulty in implementing proposals through unanimity, the Centre for European Reform’? has noted that internal discussions within the EU have so far focused on the idea of levying a tax on imports equivalent to the costs borne by domestic industries as a result of needing to buy carbon permits under the European Emissions Trading Scheme. However such a measure may annihilate the (already low) positive impact of ETS on actual greenhouse gas emissions, since the disincentive of the cost to buy ETS would be reduced.\nThis is untested ground under the WTO, and therefore it is unclear whether applying a carbon border adjustment equivalent to the costs of acquiring carbon permits under the ETS would be (i) considered a product-based carbon border adjustment; and (ii) admissible under the GATT. The framework might have to be adjusted for the different targets conferred to different EU Member States under the EU ETS, thus significantly increasing the complexity of the regime. It might, as a result, be challenging to have a single carbon border adjustment price administered towards the whole EU common market, leading to an environment of internal competition.\nIn addition, the EU ETS scheme only applies to energy intensive industries, which means that the scope of reach of the carbon border adjustment would be limited only to those industries already subject to the ETS, thus leaving a significant portion of the economy out of the regime (i.e., small/medium enterprises and the transport sector).\nA final question would be whether those countries already administering domestic carbon taxes in addition to the ETS would be allowed to adjust the carbon border adjustment upwards, to consider both the domestic carbon tax and the EU-wide ETS. This is a further issue that might build complexity in the internal market and create an unequal stand between EU member states.\n10 Centre for European Reform, Should the EU Tax Imported CO2? (by Sam Lowe), 24 September 2019\nPotential impacts on developing countries\nA carbon border adjustment, as explained above, would be a tax levied at the border at a price that is commensurate with the carbon tax (or price) being applied domestically. An EU-wide carbon border adjustment would either (i) be commensurate with the cost borne by companies under the ETS (though challenges around this are raised above); (ii) correspond to the carbon tax applied by each EU Member State (if the policy allows for different States to employ different tax rates); or (iii) be commensurate with a potential EU-wide carbon tax, introduced into the common area. The objective of such a policy is to provide cost parity between the domestically produced and the imported product, so that they are both negotiated at equivalent prices within the EU common market, and so that domestically produced products are not disproportionately affected by the domestic tax.\nThe EU might consider granting a carbon border adjustment exemption to countries administering equivalent carbon taxes. Should the EU tax rate be higher than in partner countries, a partial exemption from the tax could be administered in the EU, corresponding to the rate employed in the third country of origin. Under a partial exemption system, the carbon border adjustment rate would correspond to the EU tax rate minus the rate already employed by the third state. The overall result would be to assess the carbon border adjustment at the full EU rate, while avoiding double taxation.\nWith or without these exemptions, an EU carbon border tax may have an impact on developing countries in many ways:\nFirstly, anumber of developing nations are among important energy and mineral exporters to Europe, for example when it comes to crude oil. Many developing countries are also source countries of EU imports that are manufactured with the use of fossil fuels. As products imported from developing countries might become less competitive than they are at the moment for the EU market if a carbon border adjustment is introduced, this could result in lower exports to the EU, with potential negative impacts on jobs in those countries if flanking measures as part of a just transition are not in place. That being said, there can be of course social, climate and environmental benefits from moving away (or not expanding/incentivising) carbon-intensive industries. The CBA may however not be the most effective or fair tool to encourage this transition.\nSecondly, the carbon border adjustment would apply to goods from all countries, even the least developed countries that currently benefit from duty free entry in Europe under the Everything But Arms initiative. This does not take into account the Paris Agreement recognition that developing countries have differentiated responsibilities, as they have historically contributed far less to global emissions than early industrialised countries. That being said, we also acknowledge that developing countries that depend on exports of carbon intensive products (such as the extractives industry, with its load of adverse social and environmental impacts) may have to envision an alternative development pathway in the mid to long term. While the EU should support this transition, the EU should also respect the policy space of the countries in question, as well as international commitments in the area of climate action, finance and development. The EU could consider exempting least developed countries from a CBA or returning all proceeds from the CBA applying on imports from developing countries to those countries for their own budgetary needs.\nAn additional concern is that the CBA, if it can only be adjusted down if exporting countries already implement a carbon tax or price, could in fact act as a penalty on developing countries for not having\ntheir own carbon tax. This ignores the fact that there are various legitimate reasons why some developing countries may have decided not to implement a national carbon tax, including fairness and equality concerns at domestic level - and that they might have more suitable policy options for supporting a just transition (for example, better royalties regimes on extractives). Carbon taxes, when poorly designed, can be regressive and have disproportionate impacts on people living in poverty, who are struggling to lead dignified lives.**\nSeveral recent examples show that an increase in the price of fuel without social considerations can lead to massive protests and unrest, whether in France, Iran or Chile. There can also be disproportionate gendered impacts - for example, taxes on energy products for domestic use (e.g. gas and oil products used for heating and cooking) can impact women more as they tend to spend a higher proportion of their disposable income on household items and expenses. Developing countries should not be penalised by the EU for the choices made with regards to their tax systems alone, but should be evaluated according to their broader environmental and social policy frameworks. It would also be much fairer and more effective for the EU to instead support, through its development cooperation, the countries that are interested in implementing this kind of taxes to ensure that such policies will not further increase economic and gender inequalities.\nConclusion\nIf the EU does decide to go ahead with a CBA, it must thoroughly consider and take into consideration in the Impact Assessment the following challenges:\ne Is the CBA an effective tool to discourage carbon leakage or high GHGs in countries exporting to the EU? Are there other measures that could be more effective, e.g. import standards regulations? Is the CBA able to recognise and adjust when other national policies, practices or regulations beyond domestic carbon prices and taxes have led to reduced GHG emissions and benefits to the environment? Finding the right balance between respecting developing countries’ policy space, export needs and the EU’s policy coherence for development principle, and addressing the climate emergency by discouraging fossil fuel extraction and other carbon intensive economic activities in the EU and beyond. How to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalised by higher prices on essential products? Ways of addressing this can include the provision of affordable alternatives and systems such as public transport as well as considering providing direct transfers to low-income households to mitigate the impact on their income.’” Can the revenues from the CBA be used in a fair way? o The revenues accumulated in Europe via the CBA when imposed on products imported from developing countries could be transferred back to the countries concerned for their own budgetary goals, in order to strengthen their domestic\n11 See also ActionAid, 2020, Progressive Taxation Briefings: Carbon Taxes: https: actionaid.org/sites/default/files/publications/Carbon%20taxes_1.pdf 12 See also ActionAid, 2020, Progressive Taxation Briefings: Carbon Taxes: https://actionaid.org/sites/default/files/publications/Carbon%2Otaxes_1.pdf\nresource mobilisation for financing of public services such as housing, education, health, environmental protection, or a just transition. [e) When a CBA applies to countries that are neither least developed countries nor developing countries, such as non-EU OECD countries, the proceeds could be used for redistribution within Europe to mitigate impacts on low-income households, or alternatively they could be directed to the UN’s Green Climate Fund as additional contributions.\nFor more Information, contact lis.cunha@actionaid.org or Isabelle.brachet@actionaid.org"

        "pdf_text": "vy Government Offices of Sweden\n27 March 2020\nMinistry of Finance\nTax and Customs Department\nSwedish comments on the inception impact assessment of a carbon border adjustment mechanism\nThe Swedish Government appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the design of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), within the framework of the inception impact assessment. The issue of a CBAM is complex and closely linked to several different policy areas. It is therefore essential with transparency and an open dialogue with Member States and other relevant stakeholders as well as engaging broadly with relevant expert bodies throughout the further design process of the relevant measures.\nThe Swedish Government supports the long-term objective of climate neutrality in the EU and its Member States by 2050 and believes that the EU’s 2030 climate target should be increased to at least 55 % and be in line with the 1.5-degree objective of the Paris agreement. These measures are a prerequisite to maintain the EU’s global leadership in the fight against climate change and to seize the economic benefits of the transition.\nWhile increasing the EU climate ambition, it is essential that the risk of carbon leakage is properly addressed. Sweden has high climate ambitions and is in favour of eventually phasing out the free allocation in the EU ETS as well as the compensation scheme for increases in electricity prices indirectly resulting from costs due to the EU ETS. As a possibly more effective alternative to current measures that serve to safeguard against leakage, a properly designed CBAM can enable the EU to keep its leading role in fighting climate change in a global context lacking equivalent climate action from other major economies. The impact assessment should analyse carefully how a phasing-out of the current carbon-leakage measures could be synchronized with an introduction of a CBAM.\nThe Swedish Government therefore welcomes a thorough analysis of the legal and practical feasibility of introducing such a CBAM as an effective tool to avoid carbon leakage. The analysis needs, among other things, to consider implications on trade and competitiveness, including compatibility with WTO tules. Such an analysis will provide guidance to which type of policy measures that are best suited when designing a CBAM.\nThe Swedish Government agrees with the Commission that the main objective of a CBAM needs to be fighting climate change by avoiding carbon leakage. Sweden has a long tradition of advocating the necessity of a well- functioning global free trade.\nThe need for a CBAM can only remain as long as differences in levels of climate ambition between EU and third countries persist. The Swedish Government would thus like to underline the importance of analysing the effect of a CBAM on the incentives of third countries to reduce their emissions via for example national carbon taxes.\nSweden welcomes that the Commission’s Communication on the European Green Deal underlines the need for the EU policy response to the climate challenges to be bold and comprehensive. A CBAM is likely to be closely interlinked with other EU measures. In particular, this relates to a revision of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Swedish Government would thus like to stress the importance of presenting proposals for different pieces of such legislation in a comprehensive package where the coordination between different measures is essential. As the fight against climate change also is a core element in the envisaged revision of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), this proposal may also need to be taken into account in the broader picture of creating a well-functioning and effective set of EU measures in the BU area. The Swedish Government is separately submitting comments on the inception impact assessment of the revision of the ETD.\nIn this context, it is important that the process is transparent and that a close dialogue will be held with the EU’s trading partners. The current situation, where the use of trade defense instruments has escalated during recent years, is sensitive. In order to avoid any possible countermeasures from third countries, it is important that the mechanism is compatible with WTO regulations and that the design and assessment process is carried out in an open, transparent, predictable and fair manner.\n2 (4)\nThe evaluation of carbon content and pricing of products is complex. Defining products within the CBAM too broadly and measuring carbon contents and pricing on a highly ageregated level can be perceived as unfair, while a greater level of detail will come at a higher administrative cost. Closely linked to the administrative burden is the issue of transparency in calculations of carbon content of imported products and how to ensure reasonable control systems for imported goods. Striking a balance between detail and reasonable administrative burden for companies as well as relevant public bodies will be important. Conformity with WTO rules must serve as guiding principle to ensure that the CBAM is designed and perceived as a legitimate measure to combat climate change. As the European economy decarbonizes, many industries will switch from fossil fuels to electricity. It is therefore important that the Commission also investigates to what extent and how indirect emissions — so called scope 2 emissions — can be included ina CBAM.\nIf the CBAM is proposed to be designed as the tax measure, the Swedish Government wants to emphasize that it does not support a move to qualified majority voting for tax matters. It is important that the Member States’ competence in the tax area is respected, as well as the national parliaments’ role in decisions on tax matters. Unanimous agreement in decision-making regarding taxes within the EU is a prerequisite for the Swedish Government's and the Swedish Parliament's influence and competence in tax matters.\nAs regards the sectoral scope, the Swedish Government supports the Commission’s initiative to assess a CBAM for selected sectors only. The sectoral scope should be limited to sectors facing the greatest risk of carbon leakage. In addition, avoiding complexity in design and administration of a CBAM is also important to consider when deciding on the scope of such measures. For these reasons the Commission is encouraged to above all consider basic materials such as steel, cement and aluminium. If a CRAM would be introduced on for example these materials, the effects of such a scheme on more complex exported and imported products in the downstream value chain, such as cars and precast concrete walling units, need to be analysed.\nCompared to the EU and world average, Sweden has already a low-carbon- energy system and an energy-efficient industry. This implies that Swedish\n3 (4)\nexports already can contribute to exports with a low carbon footprint and therefore to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Sweden’s intention is to become the first fossil-free welfare state and Sweden’s national climate policy objective is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest. This has contributed to the fact that the Swedish steel industry has already committed to develop the world’s first fossil-free steel-making technology replacing coking coal with hydrogen as reduction agent! and that the Swedish cement industry plans to achieve carbon neutrality by 20302. These industries can reduce emissions not only in the EU but also in third countries. The Swedish Government thus encourages the Commission to closely analyse how a CBAM could affect export to third countries. Such an analysis should consider in particular the effects on emissions from promoting clean EU exports to third markets. If a CBAM increases the risk of exporting companies being moved to jurisdictions with more emission-intensive production methods, the possibility of introducing measures to safeguard the environmental benefits from clean production exported to third countries, must be considered. The legal basis for such possible measures should also be analysed in detail.\nDecarbonising industry is expected to increase the demand for electricity, e.g. hydrogen needed for fossil-free steel making is produced by a very electricity intensive process. Therefore, care must be taken in designing a CBAM so that the ongoing electrification and decarbonisation of industry is not jeopardised.\nIn conclusion, the Swedish Government welcomes a thorough analysis of the practical and legal feasibility of introducing a CBAM as an effective tool to avoid carbon leakage. In order to avoid increasing emissions, the possibility to introduce measures to limit the risk of carbon leakage from EU’s exports to third country markets needs to be properly addressed. Finally, the Swedish Government encourages the Commission to seek further consultation with Member States and other relevant stakeholders as well as the WTO in an open, transparent, predictable and fair manner during the continued design and introduction phases.\n1 http://www. hybritdevelopment.com/\n? https://group.vattenfall.com/what-we-do/roadmap-to-fossil-freedom/industry-decarbonisation/cementa\n4 (4)"

As an export-oriented union, Europe is involved in both international trade agreements and the Paris Agreement. Moreover, it is not a question of cementing existing technologies, but of developing new ones. We want Europe to stay an attractive location for investments and as a basis for our wide range of businesses and growth prospects.\nIf CO Border Adjustment is to set the right signals, there are five criteria for the establishment of systems, of which all must be met. Only criterion 2, the cooperation under the Paris Agreement can be implemented independently of the other four criteria. But unfortunately exactly this Paris oriented criterion does not play any role in the current debate\nEurope should be careful with the precious Paris Agreement to find an appropriate solution. A one-side establishing of a CO2 Border Adjustment without a common accepted calculation basis (Art. 6) could act like an implicite one-side denunciation of the essential Art 6 of the Paris Agreement by the EU, leading in a climate policy isolation and leaving the common mitigation path way.\nCriterion 1: Simple recording and evaluation, no disturbance of trading or debit of already existing certificates by the recording.\nCriterion 2: Support of international cooperation in climate policy on the basis of the Paris Agreement (nomenclature and Article 6 [Cooperation)).\nCriterion 3: WTO conformity for the two-way sluice system. In other words, the WTO would become an enabler of climate policy. Accordingly, the WTO should not be overburdened.\nCriterion 4: Product-oriented border adjustment will only be introduced if it can lead to a complete discharge of the CO, load.\nCriterion 5: Product-oriented border equalization must promote innovations that are focused on international competitiveness.\nNevertheless, for an efficient mitigation of greenhouse gases it is recommendable to follow an international pathway, not treating Europe like an island. In its core, it is about shaping growth and enabling investment in low-carbon or CO, neutral technologies, not about organizing social renunciation. Markets that send investment signals and stimulate innovation are therefore needed, not state-arranged scarcity.\n1. In general\nWhy do we care? We are worried about the possible implementation of a CO. border adjustment mechanism in our home market and for our international business. We plan, develop, construct, operate and market high-efficiency power plants and their by-products. Besides custom power and heat generation solutions, we offer a wide range of energy services. We are afraid that the European location is rendered less advantageous for new industrial installations due to uncertainty about state interventions and price reasons. The prices not only for imported components will increase. Investment signals and capital could just move to other regions. But by violating the world wide approach of the Paris Agreement we fear the reduced chances to use our knowledge abroad and especially in developing countries. So such a scheme has to work at once and internationally harmonized.\nIt is a concretely unknown theoretical approach. It is either a matter of isolating the European market on climate policy grounds or of fiction that border adjustment is an option to protect the European market from all additional burdens from climate policy. The additional fiction may be that these burdens could effectively be cut or disburdened accordingly. With the simultaneous removal of the existing mechanisms that serve to relieve the burden (industrial exceptions etc.). And this will also further disrupt the energy system. Theoretically, with a view to a well paved and sealed CO, island, it is possible to achieve price compensation in two directions, like in a sluice. However, the prerequisite in European reality is that all borders must be tightly and controlled uniformly.\nThis requires consistent measurement and evaluation, especially internationally. The past (partial misuse of CDM and JI instruments) shows that this leads to complex challenges in the global reality.\nIn any case, a question mark must be placed behind the reliability of statistical data in many countries. Even if CO, pricing systems also exist there, taxing on fossil production processes is by no means self-evident. In addition, there are also very different production conditions and balance-sheet optimization possibilities within countries, as it is also practiced in European industry within complex regulatory frameworks.\nThere should be taken a closer look on these aspects:\na. The calculation base can be different it-self: there are emission trading schemes with floating prices as well as tax schemes with fixed prices. It is tricky if a Carbon border adjustment scheme is to be carried out on the basis of the cost of alternative, low-carbon technologies which, however, determine higher production costs. Even with a Carbon border adjustment scheme, incentives for the worldwide efficient division of labor should remain set. Plants should be operated where they can deliver the highest added value. (This should be a chance also for European companies.)\n2. Record, measure, evaluate\nSuch a scheme has to be clear, evaluable and predictable. But, the evaluation of CO> quantities is challenging as products and primary products may have crossed borders several times and the CO, footprint can hardly be determined. Product and regionally oriented lump sums are also problematic. ' There should be taken a closer look on these four aspects, too:\nUsually only CO, is priced, but not greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, a value must be calculated which may also have to take into account the electricity mix, subsidies for fossil fuels, etc. Complex certifications of carbon footprints are also conceivable. However, there are already numerous certificates, including cross-border certificates, which would have to be taken into account (e.g. certificates of origin for Norwegian hydropower). Emissions trading means fluctuating prices, and it is also based on emissions, whereas the national system is upstream oriented, i.e. based on theoretical emissions; the financial taxonomy is based only on assumptions. Simplifying the Carbon Border Scheme to a single or two product scheme (steel, cement) will have an effect on the import of finished goods instead of production of primary products in Europe.\nDerived there is criterion 1 which has to be fulfilled: A functioning Carbon Border Adjustment scheme needs a simple recording and evaluation or measuring. The aim should be no disturbance of trading or burden of already existing certificates by the recording.\n*The German Council of Economic Experts (Sachverstandigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung) evaluates the approaches of a CO2-based border adjustment as theoretically attractive, but: , Schwierigkeiten bei der praktischen Umsetzung (Tamiotti et al., 2009).

So, it is decisive to solve the following issues:\na A crucial problem remains the continuous subsidization of exports by the carbon border adjustments, in the sense of cost relief; it is easier to imagine a burden on the CO,-footprint of imports. This means that imports may be made more expensive in order to protect national / European production from a kind of felt dumping regarding Greenhouse Gases, but the export of particularly affected products would no longer be competitive. This results in intensive negotiations in commercial contracts with an open outcome It is likely that the price of intra-European production and European sales will increase. The DIW (German Institute of Economic Science, Berlin) prefers the other way around and orientates its consumption load towards CO,-intensive products within Europe. This means a selective burden on products - without carbon border adjustment.” Problematic is the non-fact-based misjudgement that the European Economic Area will become more attractive by increasing its price. It is more likely that international markets, possibly only certain products, will avoid Europe.\nThe German “Sachverstandigenrat” (Council of Economic Experts) was also concerned about international frictions, even if the WTO's questions could be solved.?\nDerived criterion 3: WTO conformity for the two-way sluice system. In other words, the WTO would become an enabler of climate policy. Accordingly, the WTO should not be overburdened. (This would be easier if it was based on the Paris Agreement.)\n* The Impact of Implementing Consumption Charge Carbon-Intensive Materials in Europe a on https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.635169.de/publikationen/externe_referierte_aufsaetze/2019_0000/the impact_of_implementing_a_consumption_charge_on_carbon_intensive_materials_in_europe.html Inclusion of Consumption in Emission Trading\n° This is the assumption of this article from the US perspective from the\nyear\n2013, for example:\nhttps://www.climateadvisers.com/wp-content/uploads/201 7/07/20 1 3-07-Changing-Climate-for-Carbon-\nTaxes. pdf\n5\n4. Orientation towards an international Climate Policy\nAs a matter of fact, the WTO is not the biggest challenge because in the WTO dimension a Carbon Border Adjustment will be valued either under the regulation of customs or like a normal trade barrier. There are processes implemented for this, already. And hopefully the WTO is strong enough to handle it.\nMuch more difficult it is to keep up with the still developing Paris Agreement following COP21. Because a carbon border adjustment scheme has in principle to\na. be based on the still incomplete nomenclature of the COP21 treaties, and b refer to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows parties to cooperate in the implementation of their national contributions (e.g. linking national or regional instruments such as the European Emissions Trading Scheme with comparable schemes to create a common cross-border carbon market). focus on international measures for CO, reduction on the basis of Art. 6 and also integrating them mathematically into its own climate protection goals, including financial forms. Understanding how to deal with the different perspectives: The Paris Agreement was based on the regional source principle, but a Carbon Border Adjustment is based on a product backpack.\nArticle 6 is particularly interesting in detail: Article 6 of the Paris Agreement mentions voluntary cooperation and market mechanisms to achieve a reduction. Cooperation is based on joint mitigation/a joint assessment in order to act across borders. At the Madrid climate conference, no agreement was reached on this assessment.\nIn three steps it is to be examined under which conditions border adjustment can be in conformity with the Paris Agreement, or can be neutral to the Agreement or contradict the Paris Agreement.\n(1) Under what conditions can the border adjustment be in conformity with the Paris Agreement?\nPositive assessment: In order to fit in with Art. 6, carbon border adjustment must be either a concrete intergovernmental cooperation, a common sustainability mechanism or a non- market-based approach yet to be defined. A conceivable solution under 6.2. would therefore be a voluntary intergovernmental agreement by the European Union, e.g. with China, India and Australia, on the basis of which the differences in CO2 pricing systems would be offset - with agreement on measurement and evaluation. Discussions on this are not public known. Moreover, partial agreements would not provide comprehensive protection for the European steel industry or similar.\nIn order for a Carbon Border Adjustment to be based on emissions trading systems with individual states, further agreements would be necessary in addition to controls. For a comprehensive border adjustment on this basis to be in conformity with Paris, however, an agreement would first have to be concluded with all Paris states. And additionally, with the USA.\nCarbon Border Adjustment is not a common sustainability mechanism according to 6.4. After all, there is nothing commonly done for reduction - except perhaps if the revenues from the border adjustment were used for international measures. It could be argued, if necessary, with reference to 6.4. (a) that the Carbon Border Adjustment promotes sustainable development in the EU and is therefore a mechanism, but this sounds far-fetched.\nIt would be a common market mechanism if other states were to integrate themselves - factually/calculatively - into emissions trading. In that case, however, the border adjustment is not needed for these states, but for those that are not participating.\nAs border adjustment tends not to be a market mechanism when relative prices are set politically, a \"common mechanism\" is not simply the result. Since CO, in the non-ETS area is recorded and priced very differently in the EU, political pricing is unavoidable.\nThus, conformity to the Paris Agreement needs to value a Carbon Border Adjustment Scheme as an accepted \"non-market mechanism\". But this is not feasible, because the needed rules do not yet exist.\n(2) Examine whether it is simply Paris-neutral if the EU introduces border adjustment\nBorder adjustment must be based on a common assessment methodology. This always requires a minimum level of cooperation. And the assessment of emissions is complex. A - financially effective - \"CO customs system\" intervenes in all forms of intergovernmental cooperation in CO, reduction and evaluation.\nIt therefore can only be halfway neutral if the price effect is not large. Thus, a mini-border- adjustment (in terms of volume and price difference) could be neutral, but it could also not have any effect.\nIf the EU unilaterally sets relative prices for imports (or even exports) of COs, this is not (any longer) related to a joint reduction, but rather to securing an isolated reduction. And it can also be a relocation of emissions if products that were previously produced in Dublin for Morocco are, after the introduction of border adjustment, manufactured directly outside Europe for the world market.\n(3) Negative consideration whether it contradicts Paris when the EU introduces border adjustment, even if it cannot be neutral\nBorder adjustment may even be the opposite of the Paris Agreement, not only because of the spirit or the regional perspective on emissions, but because it contradicts the goal of transnational cooperation.\nHowever, border adjustments are not explicitly prohibited in the Paris Agreement. However, that does not go far enough, because it is about the underlying measures, which are not being internationally coordinated at the moment or even amount to a joint reduction. Border adjustment attempts to protect unilateral EU measures, not to achieve a joint reduction.\nTherefore, the problem is that a border adjustment system only makes sense - if at all - if no chance for global mitigation, cross-border ETS etc. is seen. This means that an introduction that does not fit in positively with Paris must be an implicit denunciation of Art 6.\nConclusion:\nIf the EU sees itself as a pioneer and role model in climate protection, then it should be ensured that border adjustments actively match the joint global greenhouse gas reduction. Otherwise it would rightly be understood as a climate policy isolation.\nThe unilateral introduction of a border adjustment system, equals to a high probability of a de facto termination of Art.6 (also because of the questions of assessment, measurement etc. ).\nA comprehensive Carbon Border Adjustment scheme can only have a reasonably neutral effect with regard to Article 6 if it does not lead to major price changes.\nA comprehensive Carbon Border Adjustment will only probably fit in with Art. 6 if a new accepted \"non-market mechanism\" is found that improves coordination in climate protection. This may include individual products or similar. But the mechanism does not yet exist.\nDerived criterion 2 which would have to address these concerns internationally: Support of international cooperation in climate policy on the basis of the Paris Agreement seems to be very decisive.\n5. Specific problem of goods with high CO, content at high prices\nFor products containing only small amounts of metal, plastic, etc., the COz price is not the relevant parameter.\nOn the other hand, the CO2 content of basic materials such as steel is very high. Under a Carbon border adjustment scheme this would lead to a significant change in prices in the event of high CO; prices. In other words, the more important a carbon Border Adjustment is for the protection of products, the more difficult it will be to implement it on the WTO side or without international trade conflicts.\nThis is further complicated by the fact that these products are particularly dependent on CO. compensation, including the existing exemptions and fundings, such as the funds from the ETS. This risks that only a proportionate carbon Border Cdjustment will be introduced for certain products. As a matter of fact, this will be outside the system, disrupt markets, affect emissions trading and not even help the industry concerned.\nDerived criterion 4: Product-oriented border compensation should only be introduced if it can lead to a complete compensation of the CO, load.\n6. New Technologies\nThe statement that a border adjustment can take CO, costs fully into account is based on the assumption that comparable technologies are used at both national and international level.\nIf steel would be produced in electric steel furnaces in France, in blast furnaces in Italy and on the basis of hydrogen in Germany, this would not be comparable within Europe. However, the possibly more expensive production based on hydrogen and the electric steel furnace would not be CO, intensive anymore. A Carbon border adjustment can possibly no longer be carried out. The steel would then simply remain more expensive. The same must apply for the cement industry.\nThesis: A carbon Border Adjustment initially prevents innovations because it acts like a protective tax here. But this protective fence is suddenly teared down if new technologies are utilized.\nDerived criterion 5: Product-oriented border equalization must promote innovations that are focused on international competitiveness.\nContact:\nDr. Hans Wolf von Koeller Head of Energy Policy Phone: +49 30 2789091-20 Mail: hanswolf.vonkoeller@steag.com\nDr. Kai Roger Lobo Deputy Head of Berlin Office Phone: +49 30 2789091-15 Mail: kai.lobo@steag.com"

Achieving the common objective of transitioning to carbon-neutral construction relies on ensuring the attractiveness of local production, while promoting innovative low-carbon investments and advanced technologies such as carbon capture use and storage, and creating demand for low carbon building materials and solutions.\n\nCompetitive EU manufacturing anchored in the low-carbon transition will only happen if a level-playing field with non-EU importers is ensured with regards to carbon costs. With reduced Historical Activity Level (HAL) and emission factor benchmark, this prerequisite will be even more important during Phase IV of the EU ETS. The expected allocation deficit puts some 40 million tonnes of EU-manufactured clinker at risk of being offshored by 2030 (equivalent to >20% of the EU demand).

Competitive EU manufacturing, driven by investments and anchored in the carbon-neutrality transition, requires a level playing field with non-EU importers with regards to carbon costs. The objective must be for non-EU importers to bear the same CO, costs as EU domestic producers. Free allocations that are awarded to EU producers must therefore be discounted from the carbon costs levied on importers. This allows for a carbon adjustment mechanism (CAM) to be compatible with the EU ETS, while remaining a mirror measure that does not interfere with the EU carbon budget and its associated mechanisms. The CAM must be dynamic in order to automatically factor-in the unpredictable variations in free allocations and carbon prices (vs. being based on fixed averages), and must be based on verified emissions of imports. The CAM must be tested and phased-in in parallel with the continuation of EU ETS mechanisms, until it is fully and successfully operational and legally secured.\nContext\nAchieving the common objective of transitioning to carbon-neutral construction relies on:\ne Ensuring the attractiveness of local production, with local resources, for local use, which among many other things allows to minimize transportation, energy use and associated emissions; Promoting and incentivizing investments and innovation in circular solutions, renewable energy and advanced technologies such as carbon capture use and storage; e Creating a demand for low carbon building materials and solutions.\nCompetitive EU manufacturing, driven by investments and innovation and anchored in the low-carbon transition, is conditional on a level playing field with non-EU importers with regards to carbon costs.\nWith reduced Historical Activity Level (HAL) and emission factor benchmark, this prerequisite will be accentuated during phase IV of the EU ETS. The expected allocation deficit puts some 40 million tonnes of EU-manufactured clinker at risk of being offshored by 2030 (equivalent to >20% of the EU demand).\nThe construction sector’s transition towards carbon-neutrality will significantly contribute to reaching Europe’s ambition to be a carbon neutral continent by 2050. The import of more carbon-intensive products to meet the demand for construction materials in Europe will slow down this transition and hamper low-carbon investments and innovation in European assets.\nIn this context, LafargeHolcim takes the view that the existing EU ETS needs to be complemented by a carbon adjustment mechanism. It is a necessary measure to maintain a fair competition as the free allocations under ETS phase IV will not be sufficient to enable EU-based manufacturing to compete fairly with non-EU imports that do not have equivalent carbon costs. In turn, it will provide the necessary assurance to continue investing in low carbon technology across European assets.\nCAM design options for the cement sector\ne Compatibility with EU ETS and free allocation: As EU ETS phase IV comes into force, free allocations are unlikely to cover the full carbon cost paid by EU manufacturers. A CAM should cover that cost difference and does not require any changes to the EU ETS as it is fully compatible and complementary.\n© 2019 LafargeHolcim\nA CAM should take into account the free allocations received by EU manufacturers in order to calculate the carbon adjustment in a non-discriminatory manner. This allows to ensure that it does not interfere with the EU’s carbon budget, that it remains separate from the EU ETS but be made compatible with it.\nCarbon cost not covered by ETS\nmechanisms and to be “levied on\nTotal carbon cost for\nimports (CAM)\nEU manufacturers\n=\nEU ETS Benchmark (free\nallocations)\na\n_\nMeasuring the CO2 content of imported clinker / cement: CEN EN 19694-3' is the standard used by the cement industry to measure and report its CO2 emissions. It forms a globally harmonised methodology for the calculation CO2 emissions from clinker and cement production. It also provides the basis for the GCCA (Global Cement and Concrete Association) Guidelines forthe monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing. These guidelines are intended as a tool for cement companies worldwide and form the basis for the NR (Gettin the Numbers Right) database which addresses all direct and the main indirect sources of CO2 emissions related to the cement manufacturing process. This standard is used by the industry globally and forms an adequate basis to report the verified emissions of any import. A dynamic CAM: the system must take into account the unpredictable variations in carbon prices and free allocations (e.g. in case a Cross Sectoral Reduction Factor applies which would have significant impact on the level of free allocations and thus carbon cost imposed on EU producers). Therefore, it must be based on a dynamic methodology that enables to factor-in the variability and uncertainty of the regulatory regime, and must not be based on fixed EU averages of past performances (which in most case would not be an accurate reflection of the current situation).\nIn practice, the charge (for the cement sector) could look like as follows:\nCarbon import charges (€/t clinker) = (verified emissions” of import + associated transport emissions in kg CO2/t clinker) - (EU ETS clinker benchmark in kg CO2/t clinker * CSRF) multiplied by the carbon price (€/kg CO2)\n950\nT\n500\nCarbon content (kg CO2/t Clinker)\nFigure 1: hypothetical calculation of carbon content of imported clinker submitted to CAM\nStationary source emissions — determination of GHG emissions in energy-intensive industries — Part 3: cement industry ?

The use of past annual averages would more than likely not be representative of the situation in a future transaction. Ability of the cement sector to pass-through costs: The methodology for calculating the carbon border adjustment should not consider cost-pass through in the case of cement. Numerous studies have shown how cement is, economically speaking, a commodity product with a high level of demand- and supply-side substitution, thereby limiting cost pass-through. Long business cycles and moderate or no growth restraints the possibility to implement cost pass-through. Furthermore, cost pass-through is specifically unlikely in the presence of high price elasticity, which is the case for cement, and especially in border markets (e.g. along the Mediterranean coast).The inability to pass through costs has been exemplified recently with specific product offerings that included a specific carbon price.\nOverarching Principles\n1 We fully support the principle of a CAM that would at first be introduced in a pilot phase as off 2021 in parallel with EU ETS (incl. free allocation). 2 A gradual phase-out of ETS mechanisms could be envisaged, but only after the trial phase and only when the mechanism is fully tested, operational and legally secured. The full deployment of a CAM, and phase-out of ETS mechanisms, requires to ultimately encompass all sectors that compete in downstream markets to avoid distortions of competition. The system must be based on verified emissions to be adjusted compared to the EU ETS benchmark (incl. any adjustments applied to the benchmark over time such as a cross-sectoral correction factor). It should not be based on EU averages of past performances as these would be meaningless for non-EU imports. Given the significant fluctuations in carbon prices, the system must take into account the actual spot price and not yearly averages.\nAbout LafargeHolcim\nLafargeHolcim is the global leader in building materials and solutions.

        "feedback": "1) Instrument: The CBA should use a fixed and steadily rising price. The price per-tonne CO2e should be lower at first (ie €15/t) to avoid an immediate shock but rise automatically every year by a set amount (ie €10/t). This works best paired with a newly-created domestic carbon fee using the same price and charged upstream “at the source” to ensure economy-wide coverage. For installations under the ETS this would serve as a floor price.\n\nBenefits include:\n+ A level playing field by combining the CBA with an EU-wide price floor. A CBA based (directly or indirectly) on the ETS price would not offer this unless (i) all emissions embodied in domestic goods are also fully covered, (ii) state aid is ended and (iii) importers can bank allowances too. \n+ Certainty. A predictably rising price allows firms to precisely compare investments in decarbonisation against a minimum cost for continued emissions, giving them confidence long-term investments will pay off. Without a clear price path, foreign producers will struggle to estimate how many allowances will be available to them in the future / what floating price they’ll have to pay. So they won’t act until they feel an impact.\n+ Minimised administrative burden. Incorporation into the ETS would (i) be challenging for customs officials to manage on a daily basis (as would a floating CBA price linked indirectly to the ETS), (ii) require expanding the allowance supply, which risks causing a shortage or excess and (iii) be complicated for exports.\n\n2) Methodology: Carbon content estimates should be based on global (not EU) benchmarks by default, with importers given the right to provide more specific measurements.\n\nBenefits include:\n+ Ambition. EU decarbonisation is farther along than in most regions, so EU benchmarks would be overly generous to importers and encourage carbon leakage (a domestic firm could get “benchmark credit” by shifting production offshore instead of actually decarbonising). \n+ Supply chain transparency. Firms would be incentivised to report / reduce their tertiary emissions, and so better understand their supply chains’ environmental impacts - a goal of the Green Deal.\n\n3) Coverage: The CBA should cover all Energy Intensive Trade Exposed (EITE) goods and be expandable to others where the impact is material.\n\nBenefits include:\n+ Elimination of free allowances and state aid. Member States can raise more auction revenues and save on state aid, providing them with additional funds to support their transitions. \n+ Adaptability. Imagine a firm manufacturing cans in the EU with imported aluminium. If the CBA only applies to primary aluminium, the firm could get around it by shifting can manufacturing offshore and importing finished cans instead. That would cause EU job losses and carbon leakage unless the CBA can be adapted.\n+ WTO integrity: The EU would not be accused of covering only those EITE goods where it stands to benefit.\n+ Revenue. The EU imports more carbon than it exports so a broad CBA would generate funds for the EU budget.\n+ Diplomacy. This creates an incentive for trading partners to price carbon.\n\n4) Fairness: The combined measures above would protect jobs and spur EU innovation. However, the CBA and loss of free allowances will increase companies’ costs, which will be passed on to consumers. For ambitious carbon pricing to be politically viable citizens must be protected. The domestic carbon fee’s net revenues should be redistributed as a monthly dividend to all households. \n\nBenefits include:\n+ Polluter pays. Carbon emissions are highly unequal in society. Most people would net benefit from an equal redistribution of carbon fee revenues, especially those with lower incomes.\n+ Families receiving a carbon dividend would have extra cash to spend in the economy. And they would see their net benefits increase if they choose to buy low-carbon goods and services.\n+ Carbon Fee & Dividend is self-funding, requiring no new budget allocation.\n",

With this European Citizens’ Initiative, we want to demonstrate that there is a broad support among the European population for Carbon Fee and Dividend. The solution is designed to impact EU emissions in line with the goals of the Paris agreement. It will have a neutral to positive effect on the EU economy. The policy has significant support from scientists, economists, NGO’s, industry and EU citizens.\nContents:\nCarbon Fee and Dividend\nBenefits\n1 The Carbon Fee\n2 The Dividend\n3 The Border Carbon adjustment\nEndorsements\nReferences\nCarbon Fee & Dividend (CF&D) consists of 3 parts:\nCarbon Fee\nThis policy puts a fee on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. It starts low, and grows steadily over time. This will drive down carbon pollution because companies, industries, the public sector and consumers will move toward cleaner, cheaper options.\n€\nCarbon Dividend\nThe money collected from the carbon fee is returned every month to citizens to spend as they see fit. Program administrative costs are paid from the fees collected. Governments do not keep any of the money from the carbon fee.\n=;\nx Xgk\nBorder Carbon Adjustment\n*\n*\nBorder Carbon Adjustments protect EU manufacturers and jobs from unfair international competition that lacks a carbon price. Imported goods will pay a border carbon adjustment, and goods exported from the EU will receive a refund under this policy.\n*\nMk\n*\n*\nxy *\nThe Benefits of Carbon Fee and Dividend\nClimate change addressed.\nA carbon fee is the most efficient way to reduce CO2 emissions (IPCC, 2015). Any other policy will cost more to achieve the same reduction.\nFamilies get paid.\nMost poor and middle income families will be better off. Money returned to households allows people to choose how to spend it.\nJobs are created.\nThe recycled revenue has been demonstrated to create jobs in local communities and in clean energy related work, such as energy efficiency and the renewable energy sector.(REMI 2014)\nA healthier environment.\nLess carbon emissions and air pollution will lead to better air quality. Many lives will be saved and health issues avoided.\nFurther economic savings possible.\nAs other government policies are aligned there will be opportunities for savings, by removing unnecessary regulations and subsidies.\nRewards positive environmental decisions.\nEveryone has an incentive to consider energy efficiency and reducing carbon footprint. This is true for individuals, families, businesses, industry and the public sector.\nIncentivises EU investment in Innovation\nConfidence in the carbon fee signal over time will also dramatically increase green investments, accelerating development and large-scale commercialisation of low-carbon technologies.\nEncourages global adoption.\nThe simplicity and transparency of the policy combined with the Border Carbon Adjustment encourages other countries to adopt a similar policy, making the planet livable.\n1\nThe Carbon Fee\nThe carbon fee is based on the economic principle that if you want less of something you increase the price.\nPutting a steadily rising price on all CO2 pollution places equal economic pressure on every ton. As a market based mechanism this incentivises the economy to remove the most cost effective ton first. As the price rises this process continues until all possible CO2 emissions are removed.\nThe fee starts low as to avoid a shock to the economy and rises in a steady and predictable way. This enables business and industry to make informed decisions related to energy, such as energy efficiency, long term investments and innovation. The economy gets an initial nudge and a clear signal for the future. All actors in the economy (industry, business, public sector, families & individuals) are motivated to adopt cleaner approaches based on financial benefits.\nThe most cost efficient place to charge the fee is up-stream as soon as the fossil fuel enters the economy, at the point of extraction or port of entry. This is because there are relatively few points to monitor with in-place processes and resources to charge the fee. The effects of the increased up-stream cost will propagate through the economy, impacting all activity that relies, directly or indirectly, on fossil fuels.\nEconomic instruments like carbon taxes are attractive because of their simplicity and broad scope covering all technologies and fuels and thus evoking the cost-minimizing combination of changes to inputs in production and technologies to changing behaviour as manifested in consumption choices and lifestyles. This is the reason they have the potential to be more efficient than directly regulating technology, products, or behaviour. To minimize administrative costs, a carbon tax can be levied ‘upstream’ (at the points of production or entry into the country). Finally,(...), a tax can piggyback off existing revenue collection systems. (IPCC, 2015)\nPrice path\nThe selected levels of the carbon fee are essential for the effectiveness of the policy and the opportunity for society to adapt. The sooner the policy is introduced, the more gradual the price increase can be. Starting in 2019 at €15 per ton and increasing by €10 per ton per year would add 3c to a litre of gasoline in the first year and 2c each year afterwards and reach the Paris goals.\nThis graph summarises the latest findings on carbon pricing (IPCC, 2015). It shows the carbon prices needed to keep average global temperature increase below 2°C and 1.5°C. The proposed price levels fit with these goals.\n$10,000\ni\n$1,000\nee\ne°°\n-oooee\n$100\nIt is based on 21 economic models under 67 different scenarios, varying assumptions on technology and economy to project temperature. 2°C results = orange bars. 1.5°C = blue bars.

Blue $35, Red $70 and the black dot is the Paris pledge. Under the suggested pricing for CF&D the price would rise to about $120 by 2030, which is in line with what is needed for the Paris pledge of EU countries.\nEE EE EEE CU\n35S Carbor\n5 Cart\nThe Canadian Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act starts at CAD 20 and increases with CAD 10 per year (Justice Department Canada 2018). In the USA, the bill The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act proposes a $10 price growth (U.S. Congress, 2019). The bill includes the capacity to increase in the price more steeply if the emissions targets are not met.This bill is estimated to cause an emission reduction of at least 40% within 12 years. Most reliable sources support a price path similar to an increase of € 10 per ton per year.\n2\nThe Dividend\n—\nThe dividend is designed to keep the economy in balance, protect the vulnerable and secure the long term public support needed to address climate change. As the cost of pollution increases with the fee, recycling all the money directly to citizens means that existing products and services within the economy can be afforded.\nEffects across National Income Ranges\nThe revenue from the fee can be split into equal shares, using 1 share per adult and 0.5 share per child for up to 2 children per household. This dividend is returned to households in the form of a monthly payment making most families better off. Increasing energy costs by Carbon Pricing on its own tends to be regressive, hitting the most vulnerable in society hardest. Recycling the money in an equal and fair way to all citizens protects poorer and middle class families more and ensures pensioners and the unemployed are reached as well. Generally wealthier people with continued larger carbon _ footprint lifestyles would lose out. The graphic is useful for visualising the impact on quintiles by income, comparing different forms of revenue recycling.\nBottom Fourth Third Second Top\n20%\n20%\n20%\n20%\n20%\nA.

This creates a fair international market and prevents the loss of industry to more polluting countries known as “leakage”. EU companies can then compete on a level playing field with their international competitors.\nIt is possible to limit implementation costs by reducing the scope of the BCA to goods classed as Energy Intensive and Trade Exposed, commonly referred to as EITE (eg. steel, concrete, paper, ceramics and chemicals such as fertilizers). This reduces the quantity of goods to be monitored.\nBorder Carbon Adjustments are compatible with WTO-rules under both Gatt article II.2 and I1l.2 (The German Marshall Fund of the United States, 2013). It is additionally established in principle under Gatt article XX paragraphs (b) and (g) as seen in the Montreal Protocol related to ozone layer depletion. This jurisprudence has confirmed that WTO rules do not trump environment. To gain de facto legitimacy, concerted adoption by major players is prefered.\nThe BCA creates economic leverage promoting wider policy adoption of compatible carbon pricing. Trading partners are incentivised to adopt matching carbon pricing in order to retain the carbon pricing revenues within their own economies.\nSolving the global problem\n= |\n#2\nJs\n-U\ninal\nClimate change cannot be solved by the EU alone. Each region of the global economy that prices carbon consistently and applies a BCA increases the economic leverage which accelerates global adoption of carbon pricing.\nUS, EU and China together are 50% of world trade. If two of these adopt Border Carbon Adjustments, the policy will likely gain de facto legitimacy in addition to it's legal justification The US “Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend act” already includes a BCA.\nOver 50% of GHG emissions are from countries classed by the World Bank or Transparency International as having governments that are weak and/or corrupt. For these countries to be successfully leveraged into carbon pricing, they need a corruption-resilient carbon pricing scheme that's easy to implement.\nThe simplicity and transparency of CF&D makes it easy to scale and hard to corrupt. It can be deployed within 6 to 12 months, requires minimal new government infrastructure and can be monitored externally (OECD, 2013). By adopting and promoting CF&D as a key solution to climate change, and encouraging the implementation of carbon pricing through a BCA, the EU can contribute to the global process of decarbonisation.\nEndorsements for Carbon Fee and Dividend.\nOver 3,400 economists signed a statement on Carbon Dividends in CLIMATE 2019.

        "feedback": "Glass for Europe, the trade association of Europe’s flat glass sector, takes note that the European Commission is considering tabling a legislative proposal to introduce a carbon border adjustment mechanism in EU law. \n\nFlat glass manufacturing is an energy intensive activity covered under the EU ETS and the flat glass sector is considered at high risk of carbon leakage. The flat glass sector has embraced the climate neutrality direction provided by the European Green Deal and issued in January 2020 its 2050 vision to maximize its contributions to this societal objective. In particular, the European flat glass sector takes it as its role to produce at a competitive price the materials essential for renovating Europe’s buildings, for supporting the clean mobility transition and for increasing the share of renewable solar energy in Europe. While already providing net carbon-avoidance products, the flat glass sector is looking into ways to massively scale up its contributions to the carbon neutral transition, including by developing novel ways to lower its industrial emissions.\n\nThe European flat glass sector agrees that all measures that could potentially reduce industrial emissions globally, while preserving a competitive advantage for EU-made low-carbon industrial goods which are needed to the EU transition towards climate-neutrality, should be carefully analysed before a legislative proposal is tabled. To contribute to the in-depth analysis of the border adjustment mechanism, the flat glass sector wishes to present the following elements for consideration:\n\nThe inception mentions in its analysis of the social impacts of inaction that the scenario to be compared to a BAM is “i.e.  increasing the EU climate ambition without any new measures addressing carbon leakage.” To Glass for Europe’s views, the decision-makers would benefit from a comparison of a broader range of scenarios to ensure the proportionality of the new measure (both in EU and WTO legislations). The scenarios could include:\n-\tScenario 0: no carbon leakage protection to industry;\n-\tScenario 1: continuation of the carbon leakage protection to industry exposed to risk of carbon leakage with free allocations at the level of the benchmark;\n-\tScenario 2: introduction of a border adjustment mechanism replacing the free allocations to industry exposed to risk of carbon leakage;\n-\tScenario 3: introduction of a border adjustment mechanism with continuation of carbon leakage protection measures under the format of possibly-reformed systems of free allocations \nThe three scenarios plus the scenario 0 (no carbon leakage protection to industry) would benefit from additional variables to be considered, such as:\n-\tIndustrial sectors included in the border adjustment mechanism\n-\tDate of entry into force of the border adjustment mechanism\n-\tRevision of the 2030 target and different levels of contribution for the EU ETS sectors\n\nIn addition to the scenarios, some further elements would be worth considering in the future impact assessment:\n-\tIn the analysis of the effects on the price of consumer products, to pay attention to mechanism such as offer and demand effects in the segments were the demand for industrial goods is expected to increase. This is particularly relevant for the construction sector with the renovation wave announced by the Green Deal;\n-\tIn the analysis of the social and economic impact of the products, to pay attention to the impact on the value-chains (in particular for complex value-chains). If the BAM was to be applied to primary material, a risk assessment of an increase in imports of transformed products should be considered to provide a full picture on its social and economic impact.  \n-\tRegarding the analysis on the administrative burden, it is necessary to include control measures in third countries since fraudulent declarations are already observed from certain countries.\n",

While free allocations address production relocation issues, CBA can effectively address emissions embedded in imports. The most concerned EU industries are those that have both: high energy consumption and high trade intensity. Examples in Luxembourg are the aluminium and steel industry. With increasing carbon costs, trade intensity in other energy intensive manufacturing sectors such as glass and cement production is expected to rise. We can expect their call for a CBA on a mid-term time horizon. ETS’ additionalities for climate protection can be leveraged when carbon leakage protection measures (free allocations & indirect cost compensa- tion) are complemented by carbon import prevention measures (CBA) in the\nconcerned EU industries.\n* Carbon Border Adjustment\n**EU communication on Green Deal, December 2019, page 5\nHow can complementary CBA help to\nreach EU climate objectives?\nThe complementarity of CBA is not going to undermine climate objectives as the free allocations are only partial and increasingly degressive, and it is still capping the total permissible EU emissions. Thus climate objectives are not put in doubt. On the contrary, without CBA, the competitiveness gap between EU producers and third country manufacturers will continue to widen as besides the free allocations and indirect cost compensations that are both partial and degressive, EU producers bear the full costs of developing and switching to low-carbon technologies, including higher post-switching operational costs. CBA can furthermore incentivise third countries to either join EU ETS or to introduce an own carbon pricing system and thus help to close the competitiveness gap and reach global climate objectives.\nA widening competitiveness gap is known to be a prime source of\ncarbon leakage and increasing carbon embedded imports. CBA can help\nto slow down this gap to further widen and thus contribute to climate\nobjectives.\nMajor design challenges of a CBA\nAn effective CBA measure must address the two challenges below:\n1. Absorption risk may prevent closure of competitiveness gap\n— While EU carbon costs apply to the entire production of an EU company, a carbon border measure is likely to apply only to the marginal volumes of a third country producers’ export to the EU - hence, third country producers can dilute and absorb costs of a CBA throughout their entire production.\nSource shifting may prevent climate protection:\n— Third country producers may reorganise to export to the EU their lowest carbon footprint products while products with high embedded emissions are sold to other markets.\nWhile the development of CBA must progress rapidly, CBA implementation\ncannot substitute free allocations and indirect cost compensations as long\nas the above two points are not fully understood and mastered.\nESSENTIAL DESIGN ELEMENTS OFA\nCARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT (CBA)\nApply CBA initially on few energy intensive industries (EII), such as steel and aluminium with the option for other sectors to gradually join; Start with EII’s finished and semi-finished products, such as coils, slabs, plates bars, etc to be extended gradually to the a wider range of the value chain; Implement CBA as a complementary measure to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality; Implement CBA to neutralise the costs of EU ETS for EU exports towards countries with no or lower carbon prices than in the EU; Determine goods’ carbon footprint by including their transport- related emissions as well as other EU regulated pollutants (NOx, SOx, etc.); Include provisions into CBA to reverse the trend of increasing exports of secondary raw materials to empower circular economy.\n\"FEDIL\nThe Voice of Luxembourg's Industry\nFEDIL - The Voice of Luxembourg’s Industry represents\nover 600 companies from the industry sector\nwww.fedil.lu\n7, tue Alcide de Gasperi\nLuxembourg-Kirchberg\nBoite postale 1304\nL-1013 Luxembourg\nfedil@fedil.lu\ntel: +352 43 53 66-1\n+352 43 23 28\nwww. fedil.lu"

        "feedback": "Total welcomes the initiative of the European Commission to propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism.  A well-designed mechanism can be a powerful tool to drive GHG emission reductions globally and at the same time avoid carbon leakage.\n\nThe risk of carbon leakage for energy intensive industries in Europe, including refining and petrochemicals, is very real as long as other parts of the world do not catch up with Europe’s climate policies – and there are no signs that the major trading partners relevant for our sectors (USA, Russia, Middle East, …) have any intention to do so.  The current carbon leakage measures (free allowances and compensation of indirect cost) are imperfect and not sustainable in the long run.\n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism that imposes direct and indirect carbon cost to importers similar to the cost already charged to European manufacturers would restore a level playing field on the European market, provide a stronger incentive for importers to adopt climate policies at home and allow the carbon content of products to be better reflected for the final customer, providing a more efficient and powerful signal for consumption and behavioral changes.\n\nThe design of a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism will have to carefully consider the potential deterioration of the competitiveness of both products exported outside the EU and products along the downstream value chain (such as base chemicals, polymers or lubricants for the Refining sector), if the CBA mechanism would apply only to some selected sectors.  Should it fail dealing satisfactorily with exports and downstream products, then separate measures will have to be developed. Providing a level playing field on foreign markets for products exported from European emission intensive industries is not only needed for supporting European industry but may also benefit global reduction efforts.  This is valid for “standard” products that are made by emission efficient European plants with less emissions than their foreign counterparts, but in the future also for new “low carbon products” (for instance synthetic fuels, in particular jet-fuels) that have significantly lower emissions when used.\n\nAs the situation may be quite different for various sectors and even within one sector, we recommend that the possibility should be given to a sector or to a sub-sector representing a family of products to be included in a carbon border adjustment mechanism, at the choice of that sector or sub-sector.\n\nA carbon border adjustment mechanism is intended to eventually replace current ETS carbon leakage measures.  However, as the real impact on all economic actors is difficult to predict, we ask for a transition period in which the new mechanism is phased in and free allowances and compensation of indirect cost are phased out in a well-organized manner.\n\nWe hope that the discussions on carbon border adjustment will promote international dialogue and contribute to climate action by all major economic players, making itself unneeded after some time.  The ultimate goal should be to include a cost for all GHG emissions, generated either in Europe or elsewhere, in the cost for all products and services globally.\n\n",

There is a risk that the level of scrutiny of carbon emissions from product manufactured in the EU will be higher than that applied to products from outside the EU. The methodology or standard applied by the EU to calculate emissions and embedded carbon in imported products will therefore be critical to the success of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. \n\nAnother key consideration is to structure the ETS price at a starting point that allows for the necessary increases to ultimately achieve net zero GHG by 2050. \n\nErvia looks forward to engaging with the Commission in the full consultation and questionnaire later this year.",

        "feedback": "Border carbon adjustment (BCA) is key to any effective climate policy in a globalized world with decentralized climate policies. It helps to prevent employment and market share losses of domestic firms. However, it is crucial to implement full BCA. This means that imports from countries are taxed at the domestic rate, and furthermore, that carbon price expenditures for exports to countries with no comparable carbon price are reimbursed to the domestic firms. This is the only way to fully restore their international competitiveness. I suggest to implement a carbon price in the EU in the form of an upstream carbon tax on all fossil fuels extracted from the earth’s crust within the EU, as well as on those imported from abroad. This is the least bureaucratic way to establish a carbon price that covers all CO2 emissions within the EU, and that correctly reflects the external damages from CO2 emissions. Then BCA should be implemented at the level of the carbon tax. The EU ETS can continue to operate. The carbon tax then effectively serves as a minimum price in the EU ETS, but it covers also all CO2 emissions in sectors not embedded in the EU ETS. BCA would be applied to all imports and exports of fossil fuels and other raw materials. For more complex goods (e.g., final consumer goods), BCA is often too difficult to implement, as the carbon content of these goods may be hard to quantify. However, if the carbon content is sufficiently low, BCA is also not necessary. A simple way to find out if BCA is applicable for certain industries might be to permit domestic firms to request the implementation of BCA for their own sector. If a sufficiently high number of firms (weighted by their market shares) requests BCA (e.g., 50 percent), then the implementation of BCA should be considered for this sector.  ",

Introduction\nThe European Commission has called for a European Green Deal to make the EU climate neutral by 2050.\" In its Communication on the European Green Deal, the Commission states that it will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors by 2021, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage, should differences in levels of ambition worldwide persist. This mechanism would be a novelty. Border carbon adjustments (and alternative measures) have been proposed in the past, both in the EU and elsewhere, such as in the US.? However, in contrast to the established border tax adjustment mechanisms that are part of VAT and excise duties systems, they have never been adopted for carbon pricing schemes.’ Therefore, uncertainties remain as to the design of such adjustment measures. Indeed, there is no single universally accepted form of border carbon adjustments. Instead, various design options exist for border carbon adjustment mechanisms and alternative measures.° The present article distinguishes between three main models that represent the key design options for the European Commission’s proposal. Informed by discussions with policymakers and stakeholders, and taking account of the most actively discussed proposals, we see three basic models that could support future implementation: the inclusion of imports into the EU ETS (Model 1), the adoption of symmetric border carbon adjustments into the EU ETS (Model 2) and the adoption of a climate contribution combined with a move towards a dynamic free allowance allocation as part of the EU ETS (Model 3).\nWe confine our analysis to measures that would be complementary to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)®. Although adjustments could also complement potential carbon taxes or potential carbon components of existing taxes — for example as part of the EU Energy Taxation Directive, which the Commission plans to review in accordance with its new climate objectives’ — the EU ETS is the EU’s main carbon pricing instrument. The question as to how border carbon adjustments or alternative measures can be implemented for the EU ETS is therefore the most relevant question to be answered at the moment. Adjustments for the EU ETS also have the advantage that they can be adopted under the qualified majority voting rules (Article 192(1) of the TFEU).® By contrast, the adoption of tax provisions would require unanimity, which would arguably make such option politically less realistic.?\nOur analysis concentrates on carbon-intensive basic materials, including steel, cement clinker, aluminium, pulp paper and plastic. Whilst border adjustments might also be applied in other fields, such as electricity, several reasons justify our focus on basic materials. First, carbon- intensive basic materials cause 25% of global and 16% of European greenhouse-gas emissions, roughly two thirds of all industrial emissions.?° Basic materials are highly commoditized and therefore strongly responsive to price signals. Their carbon intensity is far higher than that of any other industrial product. As a result, their production is particularly exposed to carbon leakage risks. At the same time, they are produced with capital-intensive processes, and therefore require effective investment frameworks for a transition to climate neutrality. From an administrative viewpoint, the limitation of the scope of the adjustments to carbon- intensive materials reduces compliance costs. Administrative requirements can be further reduced with de-minimis thresholds. Imported products that do not contain a sufficient share of basic primary materials would not be covered. Moreover, a focus on carbon-intensive basic materials allows making use of the emissions benchmarks that have already been established for these sectors at the EU level. Finally, from a political viewpoint, solutions for basic material\nproduction processes, which are often politically contentious to regulate, may allow for more technical discussions on other sectors.\nThe main goal of this article is to contribute to the current policy debate by providing an overview of and evaluating these three simplified categories of measures. Section 2 will present the basic features of each of the three basic models. Section 3, which represents the core of this paper, then tests the three models against key evaluation criteria (legality, coherence with EU climate objectives, effectiveness in carbon leakage prevention, potential international implications, as well as administrative complexity and compliance costs). Section 4 concludes.\n2. Basic Models\nThe EU ETS currently does not include any adjustments for imports or exports, but solely applies to EU installations,’ reducing its potential for helping achieve climate neutrality. A diversity of measures could be used to extend the scope of the EU ETS to a range of basic materials that are sold in the EU. For the sake of clarity, we have grouped these measures under three models. Model 1 extends the EU ETS only to imported basic materials (and, to the extent they contain basic materials, possibly also semi-manufactured and final products). Model 2, which applies to basic materials, semi-manufactured and final products, provides for adjustments both for imported and exported products. Model 3 complements the EU ETS by means of a climate contribution on basic materials sold in the EU. The climate contribution would also be levied on semi-manufactured and final products to the extent they contain basic materials. This section presents the basic features of each of these three models.\n2.1. Model 1: Inclusion of imports in EU ETS\nModel 1 provides for the inclusion into the EU ETS of imported carbon-intensive materials originating outside the EU. Adjustments would be made in respect of imported carbon- intensive products. The adjustments would seek to reflect the burden borne by products produced in the EU. There would be no adjustments in respect of exports from the EU to third countries. Technically, the inclusion could take the form of an obligation on importers to surrender allowances.’* The EU ETS Directive used to explicitly mention this option as one of the proposals that Member States might consider in order to “support certain energy- intensive industries in the event of carbon leakage”.?*\nWe assume in the following that there would be no immediate transition to full auctioning under the EU ETS. This is because free allocation arguably limits the disadvantages faced by exporters when the EU ETS does not include a relief system for exports. We further assume that free allowance allocation would, for political, environmental and economic reasons, continue to be calculated in the same way as in the past.‘* Under the current rules, the number of allowances to be freely allocated is based on historic production volume multiplied by a benchmark level for the specific product. This would, in the coming years, limit the carbon cost passed to domestically produced materials and products and would limit potential distortions to exports. The number of free allowances for an installation would be reduced where production volume falls below a threshold.*? Moreover, the level of free allowance allocation would continue to be gradually reduced in accordance with an annual benchmark adjustment factor?® (between 0.2% and 1.6%) as well a cross-sector reduction factor linked to overall emission cap reductions.?”\nImporters would thus be required to surrender allowances corresponding to the difference between the benchmark and the level of free allowances allocation. They could, however, reduce their liability by demonstrating that their specific production process was more carbon efficient than the benchmark. The reduction over time of free allocation would lead to an increase of the effective burden borne by domestic producers.\nThe scope of the adjustments on imported products would be limited to primary carbon- intensive basic materials, such as steel, pulp paper, aluminium, cement clinker or plastics (Model 1A). Materials as part of imported manufactured and semi-manufactured products would then remain outside the system. In principle, an alternative variant (Model 1B) would be conceivable with a broader scope than Model 1A. The adjustment on imports would then extend to semi-manufactured and final products made of a quantity of primary product that exceeds a certain threshold (e.g. based on specific PRODCOM categories). Such a broader scope would reflect the fact that the limitation to basic materials, namely primary products under Model 1A would be likely to discourage the import of basic materials into the EU while encouraging the import of semi-manufactured and final products that are not subject to any adjustment mechanism. Yet, such extended approach would face two objections. First, goods that are part of integrated value chains and cross the European external border several times during the production process could become subject to the adjustment multiple times, unless account was taken for the charge paid at earlier stages. This would create particular problems for integrated value chains criss-crossing frontiers.1® Second, even absent such a risk, the fact that the mechanism would apply to imports only would extend the competitive disadvantage to exporters of manufactured goods from the region. For these reasons, we do not consider Model 1B in the following.\n2.2. Model 2: Symmetric border carbon adjustment for exports and imports\nModel 2 represents a symmetric border carbon mechanism that would apply both to imports and to exports.’9 It would cover basic materials as such as well as the basic materials content of semi-manufactured and final products, provided this content exceeds a certain relevance threshold. On the import side, Model 2 would operate in the same way as Model 1B. On the export side, Model 2 would differ from Model 1B. Exporters of primary, semi-manufactured and final products from the EU and EEA to third countries would be entitled to relief, either by not being subject to the EU ETS or by benefitting from a refund for the costs associated with the EU ETS. To obtain a refund in respect of exported products, the exporters would need to submit evidence of the carbon intensity of the produced material — and therefore the carbon cost paid in the EU, either at the time of production or at the time of earlier imports. This would avoid potential distortions from asymmetric carbon costs and also prevent the cascading effects of carbon pricing for supply chains where goods cross borders several times.\nSuch a symmetric border carbon adjustment would be applied in combination with full auctioning of allowances under the EU ETS. Indeed, the addition of symmetric adjustments to the EU ETS would no longer require that allowances be allocated for free. The symmetric adjustment implies that the risk of carbon leakage — which justifies the free allocation of allowances under the current regime — is mitigated. The adjustment level for imports would be set at the same benchmark level as under Model 1. It would be based on the 10% best installations. As under Model 1, importers could choose to demonstrate that the production\nprocess of their products was less carbon intensive than the benchmark. Actual carbon intensity would then determine the adjustment level. Importers of semi-manufactured and final products would have to involve the producers of the primary products used during the production process.\n2.3. Model 3: Climate contribution combined with dynamic free allowance allocation\nModel 3 provides for the adoption of a climate contribution in combination with a reform of the free allocation regime. The climate contribution is a charge levied on selected carbon- intensive basic materials, such as steel, pulp paper, aluminium, cement clinker or plastics. The charge would apply to primary products, but also to semi-manufactured and final products, reflecting their content of the basic materials.7° In line with long-established excise duties, the charge would be imposed at the stage of ‘final’ consumption. For example, steel for a car would be subject to the charge when the car was sold in the EU rather than when the steel was produced. The level of the climate contribution would be set irrespective of actual emissions in the production process, whether lower or higher than the benchmark. Neither would the origin of the product be relevant. Instead, the contribution would be fixed per ton of basic material at the product benchmark level used for determining the number of free allowances multiplied by the carbon price of the preceding year. The climate contribution would only be imposed on products sold in the EU, not on exported products. This mechanism is very similar to any destination-based market-based regulation or tax, whose scope of application is limited to products sold in the jurisdiction (“at destination”).\nThe free allowance allocation regime would be modified to a dynamic allocation. The allocation of free allowances would be based on the current year’s or preceding year’s production volume of the installation concerned. Primary producers would hence obtain free allowances for every additional ton of material, for example steel, that they produce at the product benchmark-level. Though producers of basic materials would receive allowances for free, they would face full incentives to improve their carbon efficiency. Indeed, producers with carbon efficiency better than the benchmark would be able to sell some of their free allowances, those with carbon efficiency below the benchmark would have to buy additional allowances. The carbon price signal from the upstream emission trading scheme would, however, be largely muted in the value chain as producers could not pass carbon cost to product prices.7* As already explained, such price signal would be reinstated along the value chain by the climate contribution.\nSummarising table\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nFree\nFree allocation\nNo free allocation\nFree allocation modified\n(dynamic model)\nallocation\nunchanged\nTreatment Imports of basic materials (and, possibly, semi-\nClimate inclusion mechanism:\nof imports manufactured and final products) included into the domestic and imported\nEU ETS\nproducts subject to the charge\n(including basic material,\nsemi-manufactured and final\nproducts)\nTreatment No adjustment on\nAdjustments on exports\nNo charge on exports\nof exports exports\n(relief or reimbursement\nof the charge)\n3. Evaluation of the Models\nEach of the three models is assessed under five key evaluation criteria. Criterion 1 concerns the legality of the measure, which could also affect its political feasibility and stability. Criteria 2 and 3 are linked to the main objective of any climate policy, mitigating climate change. Criterion 2 focuses on the EU objective of decarbonisation whereas Criterion 3 focuses on carbon leakage, which could have a detrimental effect on the overall environmental effect of the EU ETS. Criterion 4 stresses the potential international implications of the measure. Given the global scale of the effects of climate change, the measure should be assessed negatively if it is likely to discourage worldwide action on climate change. Conversely, if the measure is likely to encourage worldwide action on climate change, it should be evaluated positively. Finally, Criterion 5 focuses on the administrative feasibility and compliance costs for business.\n3.1. Criterion 1: Legality\nA first evaluation criterion is the legality of the measure. With regard to EU law, we see no reasons for major doubts. Each of the measure proposed is a reform of the EU ETS, which suggests that they could all be adopted under the same legal basis as the EU ETS, namely Article 192(1) of the TFEU. In particular, the climate contribution does not represent a measure primarily of a fiscal nature. It could therefore be adopted with qualified majority voting rather than unanimity.2* Thus, the main legal issues arise with respect to public international law, and in particular with respect to world trade law.\nAlthough European Union laws can in principle be valid even if they are inconsistent with WTO obligations,?? compliance with existing’* world trade law is nevertheless important for two main reasons. First, the respect of the conditions of the international rules-based order allows for the building of the trust that is necessary to foster international climate negotiations. Second, as already explained above, the effectiveness of the EU’s climate action necessarily depends on the robustness of the carbon price mechanism to legal and political challenges. A measure that has a high probability of being incompatible with international law provisions would create uncertainty for investors as it could lead to trade disputes. This would impact upon the effectiveness of the EU’s climate policy and limit its effect on the mitigation of climate change. Although the WTO dispute settlement procedures have recently been called into question by the United States, WTO law remains an instrument that is being called upon against measures that distort international trade as a justification to adopt retaliatory measures.”? Moreover, a group of WTO members, including the EU, have agreed to put in place measures to replace the WTO Appellate Body for the time that it is not functional.”° All this implies that WTO law remains fully relevant. Thus, it is key to assess each of the models described above under international trade law.?”\nNon-discrimination under GATT\nIn this respect, the highest risk for border carbon adjustments or alternative measures is to be found incompatible with WTO law non-discrimination principles.2® Unless they can claim that their measure fall under an exception to the WTO law agreements, WTO members are not allowed to discriminate between products from other WTO members (this principle is referred to as the “most-favoured-nation principle”, see Article | of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)). Moreover, they are not allowed to discriminate between domestic and imported products (this principle is referred to as the “national treatment\nprinciple”, see Article Ill of the GATT). Both principles cover de jure and de facto discrimination.2? They thus go beyond situations where the domestic measure explicitly distinguishes between products based on their origin and also cover situations where the domestic measure produces a disproportionately disparaging effect on foreign products. De facto discrimination hence depends on the factual circumstances at stake.*°\nAlthough none of the models above seems to constitute a de jure discrimination, the Models could possibly amount to a de facto discrimination against imported products. First, when the Models are modified so as to differentiate according to whether the products come from jurisdictions with a carbon price. In particular, under Models 1 and 2, the adjustment on imports from such jurisdictions could be less than from jurisdictions without a carbon price. Such differentiation could lead to a violation of the MFN principle if importers are allowed to rely on domestic carbon policy of third countries to be exempted or granted relief from the border measures on imported basic materials (and eventually semi-manufactured and final products). Indeed, such possibility in favour of importers from countries that have adopted climate measures would discriminate against the products from countries without such climate policy. It would then be questionable whether such differentiation could be justified on the basis of Article XX of the GATT, which provides general grounds of justifications for measures that would otherwise violate this agreement, including grounds related to environmental protection (see Article XX, (b) regarding “measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health” and Article XX, (g), regarding “measures relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption”).\nSecond, the inclusion of imports in Models 1 and 2 could, depending on their specific design, be seen as a way to “afford protection to domestic production” (Article II|:1 of the GATT). This risk of incompatibility can be explained by the difficulty of imposing the exact same liability on domestic and imported products under these two models. For domestic products, the liability would arise at the production level and the costs of the EU ETS on domestic producers would be passed on to domestic products. For imported products, the liability arises at the product level. Nevertheless, it would be hard to ensure that the liability imposed on imported products exactly replicated the liability that was passed on to domestic products under the EU ETS. It is unclear whether these differences would transform the liability on imported products into either a discriminatory measure on imports (contrary to Article Ill of the GATT) or to an excessive charge imposed in connection with the importation (contrary to Article Il of the GATT). If either were the case, Models 1 and 2 would need to be justified under Article XX GATT.\nIn contrast to Models 1 and 2, Model 3 does not seem particularly problematic under the GATT. In principle, the non-differentiated application of the climate contribution implies a non-discriminatory treatment between domestic and foreign producers and manufacturers and thus avoids concerns under the GATT. Similar destination-based measures, such as product regulations and consumption charges such as excise duties, have been adopted in the past and not been found problematic.**\nSubsidies under the ASCM\nBesides the GATT, WTO members also need to respect the provisions of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM). This agreement regulates subsidies, including tax subsidies (Article 1.1(a)(1)(ii) of the ASCM, with the reference to the cases where “government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not collected”). Two main aspects of the models presented above could, allegedly, be assimilated to subsidies, namely (i) the relief for exports under Models 2 and 3 — there would be no relief for exports under Model 1 — and (ii) the free allocation of allowances under Models 1 and 3, whereas there would be no free allocation under Model 2.\nRegarding the relief for exports, the ASCM is relevant in that it prohibits the adoption of export subsidies, namely “subsidies contingent, in law or in fact, (...) upon export performance” (Article 3.1 (a) of the ASCM). The question therefore arises whether Model 2 and Model 3 could be assimilated to such export subsidies. Regarding Model 3, there does not seem to be any problem under the ASCM as the non-application of the climate contribution to exported products is very similar to the treatment of exports under traditional destination-based taxes. The ASCM explicitly rejects the assimilation of excise duties or value added taxes, when they are not imposed to exported products, to export subsidies.?* By contrast, Model 2 might be more problematic because the adjustments would be made in respect of the EU ETS, which is being imposed on domestic producers rather than on domestic products. This distinguishes Model 2 from traditional adjustment measures and, therefore, makes it somewhat more controversial. Indeed, there is disagreement in the legal scholarship as to the treatment of exemptions (or refunds) of exported products in respect of carbon taxes, charges and regulations that apply to producers.?? Model 1, which does not include adjustments in respect of exports, would not present any risk under the ASCM, except if the free allocation regime is questioned, which is analysed in the next paragraph.\nConcerning the free allocation regimes, there has been a long debate in the literature on their compatibility with the ASCM.*4 Arguably, the allocation of free allowances to certain sectors could be assimilated to an export subsidy (prohibited under the ASCM) or to an actionable subsidy (not prohibited as such under the ASCM but potentially opening the door for other WTO members to adopt countervailing duties or countermeasures). Although the free allocation regime is not directly linked to exports, it could be seen as a measure aimed to help certain sectors export the materials they produce.*° If it were not assimilated to a prohibited export subsidy, the regime could still be seen as an actionable subsidy if it “causes adverse effects to the interests of other Members” (Article 5 of the ASCM). The analysis, which is made on a case-by-case basis, could take account of the costs imposed on domestic producers (e.g. for allowances that need to be surrendered). The absence of disputes against such regimes seems to indicate that they are not problematic under the ASCM. Although it is ultimately impossible to predict whether the free allocation regimes under Models 1 and 3 would be problematic under the ASCM, we therefore consider the risk of violation of the ASCM to be very limited.\nFurther principles of public international law\nFinally, two further principles of public international law in particular need to be considered. First, there is the territoriality principle. All Models would not comprise extraterritorial measures, i.e. the application of a measure triggered by something other than a territorial\nconnection with the regulating state. To the extent importers under Models 1 and 2 would demonstrate that their actual emissions were better than the benchmark, circumstances abroad would need to be taken into account, a situation which has been aptly described as a territorial extension.2° While such a territorial extension is not illegal under public international law, it would give rise to monitoring and verification needs. Such needs could, so as not to infringe the sovereignty of the state where the materials are produced, not be fulfilled without its assent by officials of the EU or its Member States. In practice, this would imply the need to involve private agents as independent verification agents, a strategy that has been adopted under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism.\nMoreover, the principle of common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) that is mentioned in Article 3 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change?’ could encourage the EU to grant favourable treatment to products from developing or least- developed countries. It is being discussed to (partially) exempt importers from jurisdictions with a carbon price from their EU liability or to give a credit for carbon pricing paid in other jurisdictions.?8 Yet such differentiated application of border carbon adjustments could lead to additional problems under WTO law as it could be seen as a violation of the most-favoured- nation principle,?? given that uncertainties remain as to how domestic measures that are aimed at implementing the principle of CBDR would be analysed under the GATT. Moreover, it would involve difficult judgements including about foreign carbon leakage protection mechanisms. It would also further increase the administrative requirements to not only track carbon intensity but also jurisdictions along the value chain. Therefore, the measures should preferably be designed in a neutral way with no reference to specific countries, giving importers the possibility to demonstrate the carbon neutrality of the goods they import, regardless of the climate legislation in place in the country of origin.*°\nModel 1a\nModel 2\nInclusion of imports in Symmetric border\nEU ETS combined with carbon adjustment\ncontinued free\ncombined with full\nallocation\nauctioning (no free\nallocation)\nModel 3\nDynamic free\nallocation combined\nwith climate\ncontribution\nUnder EU law (legal basis\nUnder International\ntrade law (GATT)\nQualified majority (QMV)\nIn principle, in line\nwith Article Ill GATT\nPossibly in violation of Article II| GATT;\npossibly justified under Article XX GATT\nUnder International\ntrade law (ASCM)\nOthers (territoriality\nprinciple; CBDR\nprinciple)\nVery limited risk regarding ASCM\nDepending on the design of the measure\n3.2. Criterion 2: Coherence with EU climate objectives\nThe second evaluation criterion assesses the consistency of the measure with the EU’s climate objectives. Border carbon adjustments or alternative measures should contribute to the EU’s achievement of its decarbonization objectives (namely, its 2030 emission targets, its objective of climate neutrality by 2050, with its potentially additional targets for the shares of activities that should become carbon neutral by 2030). We have identified three interrelated requirements against which we test the three models.\nFirst, incentives are needed to improve the carbon efficiency of production processes so as to achieve climate neutrality. All Models seem to meet this requirement. Although free auctioning could reduce the incentives to improve carbon efficiency, this does not seem to be the case for the Models presented above. Model 2 is characterised by full auctioning, which means that incentives for carbon efficiency improvements are necessarily preserved. Under Model 1 and 3, the free allocation of allowances is based on benchmarks, which also implies that incentives for carbon efficiency improvements are preserved. Indeed, efficiency improvements allow producers to save buying additional allowances or may even sell surplus allowances if they beat the benchmark. In Model 1, however, the allocation mechanism is distortive. The allocation is not directly linked to production volumes, and hence firms in some sectors and years will likely profit from reducing production volumes and selling free allowances. To avoid excessive windfall profits, activity thresholds have been introduced in free allocation mechanisms, which in turn undermine efficiency and can trigger excessive carbon emissions.’\nSecond, full carbon cost internalization is required in order to encourage users of materials such as manufacturers and the construction sector to shift to alternative materials with lower carbon content and enhance material efficiency. Model 2 achieves full carbon cost internalization through exposing producers and importers to full carbon costs. Model 1 limits the exposure to carbon costs for domestic producers (free allowance allocation, which means that only partial internalisation of the carbon price will take place) and importers (liability limited to the benchmark level used for the allocation of free allowances, which also means that the carbon price will only be partially internalised). Therefore, Model 1 only results in partial carbon cost pass through and does not achieve full carbon cost internalization. In Model 3, the free allowance allocation based on a common benchmark to conventional and climate neutral producers also reduces the carbon cost internalization at the level of the benchmark. However, this benchmark is subsequently charged on all products delivered to final users. Hence, the carbon cost is internalized in all decision processes.\nThird, full carbon cost internalization is also required by investors in climate neutral production processes so as to allow them to recover incremental costs. In Model 2, the cost of conventional material production or its import increases with the carbon price, thus allowing carbon neutral producers of basic materials to achieve a correspondingly higher sales price to cover incremental cost. In Model 1, domestic producers with conventional processes continue to receive a significant share of free allowances, while imports are only charged a fraction of the carbon cost. Hence domestic material prices will only partially reflect carbon\n10\ncosts — inhibiting investors in clean material processes from recovering investment costs. In Model 3, both climate neutral and carbon-intensive material producers receive free allowances at the benchmark level. Carbon-intensive material producers need the allowances to cover their emissions, while climate neutral producers can sell the allowances and can thus cover their incremental costs.\nIncentives to achieve climate policy\nModel 1A\n| Model 2\n| Model 3\nobjectives\nIncentives for existing assets to improve\nFull effect achieved in all models\ncarbon efficiency of production\nFull carbon cost internalization for\nmaterial efficiency/substitution and\nclimate neutral processes\nOnly partial\nYes\nFull carbon cost internalization for the\nrecovery of incremental costs\n3.3. Criterion 3: Effective carbon leakage prevention\nThe third evaluation criterion concerns the robustness of each Model to carbon leakage. Carbon leakage refers to the phenomenon where the reduction in emissions (relative to a benchmark) in the implementing jurisdiction is cancelled out by an increase of emissions in third countries.** Carbon leakage undermines the achievement of the objective of global emission reductions. Given the worldwide effects of climate change, there is no point in reducing carbon emissions in one country if domestic policy measures have a negative global effect. Admittedly, existing European climate policies have so far not resulted in demonstrable carbon leakage.*? Free allowance allocation under the EU ETS as well as its relatively low carbon prices have limited — or even avoided — cost increases on EU producers in comparison to international competitors. Consequently, the incentives to relocate production to third countries remained modest or non-existent. However, the situation might change with the gradual phase-out free allowances allocation post-2020.** Simultaneously, the EU Commission proposes as part of the Green Deal to raise the overall emission reduction target from 40% relative to 1990 levels to at least 50%.* This will likely also lead to a tightening of the EU ETS cap and therefore to an increase of the allowance price. Climate neutral material production processes will involve incremental costs exceeding current carbon price levels, which explains the debate on whether the current approach to carbon leakage prevention will suffice.\nWhen it comes to the risk of carbon leakage, five dimensions need to be distinguished: their effect on the sale of materials in the EU (i) and foreign markets (ii) as well as their effect on manufacturing industries selling in the EU (iii) and abroad (iv). Finally, opportunities for resource shuffling could trigger carbon leakage (v).\n(i) Regarding the sale of materials in the EU, all three models ensure that domestic and foreign material producers face (almost) similar carbon costs and thus avoid any incentives that may — if sufficiently large — contribute to production relocation and thus carbon leakage. (ii) With respect to the sale of materials in foreign markets, Model 1 leads to the gradual increase of carbon costs for European material producers due to the declining free\n11\nallowance allocation levels. Should third countries not impose a similar policy and should cost difference reach sufficient scale, then exports by European material producers could decline and corresponding production and emissions could be relocated abroad. This potential effect is avoided in Model 2 (given that carbon costs are refunded by means of border carbon adjustments in respect of exports) and in Model 3 (given that free allowance allocation is maintained, and the climate contribution is imposed only on domestic consumption by final consumers). (iii) With respect to manufacturing industries selling in domestic markets, Model 1 gives rise to risks of carbon leakage. It increases prices for materials in domestic markets. This would create incentives to relocate the manufacturing of semi-finished products. Manufacturers could import semi-finished or final products not subject to the border carbon adjustment and thus access materials free of carbon cost. If this effect were to reach sufficient scale it could also contribute to a relocation of production of basic materials to potentially less efficient foreign sites. Such incentives are neither present in Model 2, as the border carbon adjustment applies to the entire value chain (both basic materials and manufactured products), nor in Model 3, as the climate contribution applies both to domestic and imported basic material and manufactured products. (iv) With respect to manufacturing industries selling in foreign markets, Model 1 results in a gradual increase of carbon costs on basic materials bought by European producers. If the cost increase is of sufficient scale and if other regions do not impose similar carbon costs, sales of manufactured products with large shares of carbon intensive materials in foreign markets may decline. This would likely imply a shift of production and emissions abroad. Such an effect would be avoided in Model 2 as carbon costs are refunded for the entire relevant value chains and in Model 3, as free allowance allocation levels avoid significant incremental carbon costs for European producers compared to international producers. Moreover, under Model 3, the climate inclusion mechanism would not lead to carbon leakage with respect to sales of semi-manufactured and final products in foreign markets given that the charge applies only to domestic sales. (v) Resource shuffling would be incentivised in Model 1 and 2 as importers pay zero import charges for materials produced with zero emission, e.g. through the (deemed) use of zero carbon electricity. This creates incentives to export such materials to the EU and consume more carbon intensive materials domestically or export them to jurisdictions with no adjustment mechanism. In other words, if only some regions implement import charges, existing plants will then profit even though actual production patterns remain unchanged. This may even result in an increase in production volumes of electricity-based materials that can claim (contracts with) carbon neutral electricity. However, in most power systems, additional power demand would, at least in the short-term, be met by fossil fuel power generation. The adjustment mechanism may thus trigger a relocation of moderately carbon efficient domestic power and material production towards foreign, potentially less efficient material and fossil fuel-based power generation.\nThe risk associated with these effects is highly uncertain and would likely trigger highly controversial debates.\nEffective carbon leakage prevention\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\n12\nDomestic sales of basic materials\nOverall effective carbon leakage prevention\nExports of basic materials\nGradual increase of\nOverall effective carbon leakage\nDomestic sales of manufactured products\ncarbon costs could\nprevention\nresult in carbon\nExports of manufactured products\nleakage risk\nResource shuffling\nAllocating carbon neutral electricity None\nto materials exported to EU\nincentivises production increases\neven in countries with significant\ncoal power generation.\n3.4. Criterion 4: International implications\nThe fourth evaluation criterion concerns the international implication of each of the Models presented above. Border carbon adjustments and alternative measures might not actually lead to trade disputes, but they might remain controversial and undermine international cooperation. We need to consider this risk by analysing which of the three models described above would support, rather than undermine, climate action at the international level. Each of the Models could have an impact on third countries: (i) favouring international cooperation and/or (ii) the introduction of domestic climate measures. Moreover, each of the Models could have an indirect impact on foreign producers (iii) and manufacturers (iv).\n(i) Border related measures could, in some occasions, undermine international climate cooperation if they were used as a means of pursuing the tactical objective of signalling a clear EU stance on multilateral concerns relating to trade and/or climate.*° To achieve such leverage, a border related mechanism is often proposed as a reprehensive measure against non-cooperative countries. As this would inherently violate the WTO most- favoured-nation principle, such proposals would create an inherent tension between the use of a tactical instrument and the goal of providing long-term investment security through carbon leakage prevention. None of the three models described above follows this logic, which is commendable. Depending on their design, the Models could, however, lead to the singling-out of certain countries if importers were allowed to rely on domestic carbon policy of third countries to be exempted from the border measures on imports. Such design, favouring certain countries and disfavouring others, would likely undermine international climate cooperation. (ii) In addition to their potential negative effects on international climate cooperation, climate policies, in certain cases, can act as a disincentive for third countries to adopt climate measures. For example, the (albeit partial) carbon cost internalization, under the current ETS system and under Model 1, implies that European manufacturing industries face higher material prices than their foreign competitors. This could be perceived by third countries as a disincentive to implement similar measures. By contrast, Models 2 and Models 3 do not suffer from such deficiency. (iii) Climate policies can have an impact on foreign producers of basic materials, encouraging or discouraging them to improve the carbon efficiency of their production processes. Models 1 and 2 reduce the import charge on basic materials, if foreign producers can\n13\n(iv)\ndemonstrate that their production process is better than the product benchmark. Conversely, improvements of installations that remain worse than the product benchmark are irrelevant and thus not incentivized. In Model 1,47 the incentives are further limited, because it covers only imported basic materials and not semi-manufactured and final products. In practice, the incentives provided for foreign material producers are therefore rather restricted and may thus have, if any, a moderate impact on investments. By contrast, Model 3 does not create such incentives. The climate contribution is to be imposed on basic, semi-manufactured and _ final products sold in the EU/EEA, indistinctively of the production process of the products. 48 Climate policies may also create incentives for supporting efficient material use by foreign manufacturers (rather than efficient material production, as analysed supra under (iii)). Models 2 and 3 create such incentives for foreign manufacturers exporting to the EU. By contrast, Model 1*° does not have such an impact, due to the lack of adjustments for semi- manufactured and final products.\nModel 1\nNegative, if singling-out of non-cooperative jurisdictions\nThe fifth and final evaluation criterion concerns ease of administration. Ideally, the measure should be easy to administer, and compliance costs for business should be low. Models 1 and 2 are likely to be more burdensome than Model 3, which is fully based on benchmarks and therefore does not require specific data on the carbon intensity of domestic and imported materials.\nModel 1 would require data on the carbon intensity of production processes taking place abroad, when importers show that actual emissions were better than the benchmark level. The public international law principle of territoriality as an emanation of sovereignty implies that the EU or its Member States could not undertake control checks outside their territories without the consent of the respective State. Such data would therefore most likely require additional verification procedures by private actors. While this is in principle feasible and has been adopted under the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto-Protocol, it would give rise to additional administrative complexity.\nModel 2 would be more cumbersome than Model 1 when importers would show that actual emissions were better than the benchmark level. As under Model 1, this would require the EU to verify the data provided by foreign producers on the carbon efficiency of their production methods. There would be a significant difference, however: such verification would have to\nnegative\nVery limited\nLimited\nLimited\nFull\nInternational incentives\nModel 2\nModel 3\nfor international cooperation\nfor third countries to implement\nneutral\ncarbon pricing\nfor foreign material producers for\nNone\ncarbon efficient production\nfor foreign manufacturing industry\nFull\nfor efficient material use\n3.5. Criterion 5: Administrative complexity and compliance costs\n14\ntrace the carbon intensity of products along the value chain. Moreover, under Model 2, the EU will also need to assess data on domestic primary, semi-manufactured and final products in order to apply the adjustments on exports. This would not only require the tracking of materials, but also of their carbon intensity. If exporters were to receive refunds in cash or allowances, additional administrative costs would likely apply to Model 2. Refunds could be expected to lead to fraud, as it has been the case under traditional VAT systems. Consequently, more stringent reporting and monitoring mechanisms would be necessary.\nModel 3, by contrast, is fully based on benchmarks and therefore does not require specific data on the specific production process of materials and materials contained domestic and imported products. This, in addition to the absence of refunds, would limit administrative and compliance costs.\nAdministrative Model 1A\nModel 2\nModel 3\nfeasibility and cost\nRequirements\nInternational tracing of Domestic and\nOnly reporting of weight\ncarbon intensity of\ninternational tracing of of material of different\nproduction required,\ncarbon intensity along types required\nwhere there is no\nentire value chain,\nreliance on benchmarks where there is no\nreliance on benchmarks\nA. Conclusion\nAs part of its Green Deal, the new EU Commission has announced that it will table a proposal for the adoption of a border carbon adjustment mechanism aimed at reducing the risk of carbon leakage, should differences in levels of ambition worldwide persist. This approach is in line with the basic tenets of the Paris Agreement, which recognises that countries are responsible for the definition of their own national climate policy regimes and encourages them to cooperate at the international level in order to support national climate action, including through financial means. As there are various design options for border carbon adjustment mechanisms and alternative measures, we have condensed the key options into three basic models: the inclusion of imports in the EU ETS (Model 1), the adoption of symmetric border carbon adjustments into the EU ETS (Model 2) and the move towards a dynamic free allowance allocation under the EU ETS in combination with a climate contribution (Model 3). We have sought to contribute to the current policy debate by providing an overview of and evaluating the three models against the criteria legality, coherence with EU climate objectives, effectiveness in carbon leakage prevention, potential international implications, as well as their administrative complexity and compliance costs.\nModel 1 extends the EU ETS to imported carbon-intensive materials (and, to the extent they contain basic materials, possibly also semi-manufactured and final products) from third countries. The adjustments would seek to reflect the burden borne by products produced in the EU. There would be no adjustments in respect of exports from the EU to third countries. The evaluation indicates that this model scores the lowest on the evaluation criteria. Regarding legality, there is a risk that it be found to violate WTO law. It is also not fully coherent with regard to the EU climate objectives: it is unlikely to support sufficient carbon price levels to achieve climate neutral production processes. Indeed, once the level of free allowances allocation will start to decline and carbon prices will increase, Model 1 will create\n15\nincentives for the import of semi-finished products (not subject to the charge). Furthermore, with competition from imports, carbon cost internalization along the value chain will be limited and so will the incentives for resource efficiency, material substitution and the business case for climate neutral production processes. Moreover, it does not effectively address risks of carbon leakage and might have adverse implications for international cooperation by discouraging third countries to introduce or strengthen carbon pricing. Model 1 would also entail significant administrative effort and compliance costs, as it would require international tracing of carbon intensity of production required, where there is no reliance on the benchmarks.\nModel 2 represents a symmetric border carbon mechanism that would apply both to imports and to exports. It would cover basic materials as such as well as the basic materials content of semi-manufactured and final products, provided this content exceeds a certain relevance threshold. Overall, Model 2 scores better against the evaluation criteria. Regarding the legality, the same issue as under Model 1 arises with respect to world trade law. It seems preferable to Model 1 when it comes to the coherence with EU climate objectives, as the adjustment mechanism would cover most of the value chain and exports should be relieved of the carbon costs. It would contribute to full carbon cost internalization. While it may appear effective at addressing carbon leakage, it is vulnerable to resource shuffling, which would reduce its effectiveness. It would avoid the adverse implications for international cooperation that characterize Model 1. Finally, it would imply administrative complexity, where importers want to demonstrate that actual emissions were lower, due to the need for data on the carbon intensity of all the components of the products subject to the adjustment and for monitoring compliance abroad.\nModel 3 complements the EU ETS by means of a climate contribution on basic materials sold in the EU. The contribution would also be levied on semi-manufactured and final products to the extent they contain basic materials. Free allocation of allowances would be directly linked to the volume of material production at the product benchmark level. All in all, the Model scores best against the evaluation criteria. Model 3 is in principle in line with world trade law. It is coherent with EU climate objectives, as the adjustment mechanism would cover most of the value chain and exports should be relieved of the carbon costs. Moreover, this model would contribute to full carbon cost internalization and it is effective at addressing carbon leakage. It is free from adverse implications for international cooperation. As it builds on established mechanisms of free allowance allocation (for example in Korea, China, California) and of consumption charges (such as excises on fuel), it is also more likely to be found acceptable by the international community. Finally, Model 3 offers an approach with limited administrative complexity and costs.\nNevertheless, neither of the Models — not even Model 3 - is a panacea. In particular, encouraging firms with conventional production processes to shift to climate neutral options requires additional support in all Models.°° Carbon pricing alone is unlikely to be sufficient particularly given political and distributional concerns about very high carbon prices. The adoption of complementary measures, including public procurement, products and sustainable finance regulations, will be key to support the shift towards a climate neutral Europe. First, public procurement regulations could lead to an obligation of “climate neutrality” for the purchase and use of specific products (e.g. public transport or publicly\n16\nprocured buildings). This would give an additional push for material producers to engage with climate neutral processes and for material users to enhance material efficiency and explore substitute materials. Second, countries may also support their citizens in taking responsibility for the carbon footprint of their consumption and investment choices. This may initially involve better information on the carbon costs of products and activities and latter lead to the adoption of additional measures such as product carbon requirements. Product carbon requirements could be implemented requiring that from the 2030s all products sold in the EU be based on materials from carbon neutral production.°** Such license to operate and sell into the internal market would lead to a de facto requirement to use climate neutral technologies and supply chains. Third, sustainable finance informs investors about their exposure to climate policy risks (transition risks). Companies would thus aim to demonstrate how quickly they can secure climate neutral produced materials and would therefore further enhance their cooperation with material producers to achieve this objective. All this means that Border Carbon Adjustments and Alternative Measures or only one of several tools in the tool box, but they certainly have a key role to play to ensure the low carbon transformation in the materials sector.\n17\n1\nEuropean Commission, Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, The European Green Deal, Brussels, 11 December 2019, COM(2019) 640 final [hereafter “The European Green Deal”].

        "feedback": "GSV (Groupement de la Sidérurgie — Steel Industry Federation) is the trade association of steel companies producing or processing steel in Belgium. Belgium stands at the sixth place in the EU in the area of steel production, and is even one in area of intolerance in Europe. GSV has 10 member members who directly employ 10.500 employees and directly and indirectly employ 25.000 employees. The 10 sites in Belgium offer a wide range of products ranging from cold rolled steel to hot rolled, galvanised and lacquered steel. It is important to note that these products are 84 % for export and that only 16 % remain within Belgian borders. \n\nOne of the 10 sites in Belgium is ArcelorMittal Gent. It has two blast furnaces and an integrated steel plant, which means that the raw materials (iron ore and coal) are processed into high value finished products intended for the automotive sector and other industrial sectors such as the construction sector, white goods, packaging, etc. All this is done on the same site. This includes ArcelorMittal Gent as one of the most performing steel producers in Europe (and even in the world) in favour of green steel and energy efficiency (and therefore belongs to the ‘benchmark’). Per tonne of steel produced in the world, ArcelorMittal Gent has 1,7 tonnes of CO2, compared with an average of 2,5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of CO produced in the world. In addition, the company is currently investing in breakthrough technologies paving the way towards a climate-neutral steel production (see more on: Http://www.steelanol.eu/en). They do not face these investments and costs and usually produce steel which is much more polluting and cheaper. In order to ensure a level playing field and the competitiveness of the Belgian steel industry, which makes enormous efforts to produce green steel, GSV argues that the creation of an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’ is crucial. \n\nPlease note that this mechanism would in no way replace the existing protective measures against the risk of “carbon leakage”, such as for example the free allocation of emission allowances under the ETS. This free allocation is primarily intended to address the risk of relocation of production, while an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’ is an effective tool to structurally address the embedded emissions in non-EU steel. \n\nThe steel industry is one of the largest emitters of CO2 in the world. This is due to the specific features of the steel production process and in particular to the reduction of iron oxide to iron. The steel industry is therefore facing a huge challenge, which at the same time brings enormous opportunities. CO2 reduction in the steel production process is possible provided the necessary financial means and an adequate regulatory framework are in place. As mentioned above, several new technologies for climate-neutral steel production are currently being launched and unified (e.g. the steelanol project). It is therefore argued that the current protection measures should be maintained until these new breakthrough technologies achieve sufficient market penetration. During this transitional period, it will thus be possible to mobilise the necessary financial resources for these investments and to facilitate the transition towards a climate-neutral steel production without undue shock effects.  \n\nGSV is of the opinion that such an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’ is WTO-compatible, and a legal study indicating the WTO compatibility of such an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’.",

        "feedback": "Risk for carbon leakage to be addressed in the context of higher climate ambition\n\nFortum as a major European utility recognises the need to address the increasing carbon leakage risk for the European industries in the context of higher climate ambition and supports the Commission’s initiative to investigate measures in mitigating carbon leakage and establishing a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism in the EU. The EU has to ensure the competitiveness of European companies exposed to global competition. At the same time, we emphasise that the extension of carbon pricing globally should be the priority and we encourage the EU to continue its international climate diplomacy and working with global partners in raising the global ambition and applying carbon pricing.\n\nHowever, realizing the fact that currently only 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are subject to some kind of carbon pricing and an extensive global carbon price is still far away, the EU needs to take measures in those sectors where carbon leakage demonstrably exists and where the risk is the highest. In our opinion, any kind of a CBA mechanism should incentivise decarbonisation, promote more ambitious climate policies and enhance carbon pricing in third countries.\n\nAny CBA mechanism will have to comply with World Trade Organisation rules.\n\nCarbon leakage relevant in cross-border power trading\n\nCarbon leakage has traditionally been recognised as a challenge for industrial sectors. However, carbon leakage is also increasingly relevant in cross-border power trading between EU member states and third countries. Currently, 13 EU countries are physically connected with 11 non-EU countries and 33 TWh of electricity was imported to the EU region in 2019. About 2/3 of this was coal-based electricity. Cross-border power trading between EU member states and third countries is expected to increase and potentially result in increasing carbon leakage.\n\nCarbon border adjustment in the power sector could be more straightforward than in industry, because flows of electricity are transparent and the relatively simple production chain allows better tracking of carbon content of the product. As electricity is not subject to free allocation in the EU ETS, carbon border adjustment will not be an overlapping measure.\n\nCBA mechanism in power sector to be based on GoO and EU ETS\n\nRegarding the type of policy instrument for CBA, Fortum prefers an instrument building on existing systems and agreed methodologies. In our opinion, the most suitable instrument for tackling carbon leakage in the power sector would be a guarantee of origin (GoO) system combined with an obligation for the electricity exporter to purchase and surrender EU emission allowances (EUA). Both the GoO and ETS are existing and proven European systems and extending them to power imports would minimize administrative burden in establishing the CBA mechanism. The EU ETS provides an explicit and dynamic carbon price at which the imports can be charged.\n\nAlternatively, carbon border adjustment in the power sector could be imposed in the form of a tariff based on the embedded carbon. A border tariff may be simpler than the obligation to surrender allowances, but the tariff would entail practically no incentive to invest in less emitting power generation in third countries, as the incremental effect on average carbon intensity would likely be too marginal to provide a measurable return.\n\nIn order to promote market-based, competitive and transparent solutions, an additional prerequisite should be that all imported electricity is sold through common European market platforms instead of bilateral contracts. This also ensures that the origin of electricity can be reliably traced.\n",
        "pdf_text": "@fortum\nPostal Address\nPosition\n16)\n12.3.2020\nFORTUM’S VIEWS ON CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT IN THE POWER SECTOR\nKey messages:\nCross-border power imports from third countries to EU member states and related carbon emissions are expected to increase. This imported electricity is not subject to comparable climate policies and carbon pricing as in the EU, thus there is a risk of increasing carbon leakage. The primary solution to preventing carbon leakage is more global carbon pricing. However, currently only 20% of global emissions are subject to any kind of carbon pricing, and having an extensive global pricing system in the near future is unlikely. In the absence of global carbon pricing, the EU’s increasing climate ambition necessitates the establishment of a carbon border adjustment (CBA) in the power sector. Such a mechanism could restore the integrity of EU climate policy and ensure that the price of power imports reflects its carbon content. In addition, it could incentivise the decarbonisation of electricity production and the introduction of carbon pricing in third countries. The import of power differs from the importation of industrial goods; hence also the solutions for CBA in the power sector should differ from solutions in industrial sectors. The flows of electricity are transparent and the relatively simple production chain allows better tracking of carbon emissions. The most suitable mechanism to tackle carbon leakage in the power sector would be a guarantee of origin (GoO) system combined with either an obligation for the electricity exporter to purchase and surrender EU emission allowances (EVA) or with a carbon border tariff. These options should be further investigated. CBA requires thorough consideration of its costs and benefits as well as of compliance with the WTO rules.\nDivision\nPhone/Fax\nCompany\nVisiting Address\nBusiness ID VAT Reg.No Domicile\n@fortum\nBusiness ID\nVAT\nReg.No\nDomicile\nPosition\n2 (5)\n12.3.2020\nCarbon leakage has traditionally been recognised as a challenge for industrial sectors. European industry competes globally and is subject to the EU climate targets and carbon price (EU emissions allowances), whereas its competitors outside the EU do not have corresponding climate ambitions and pricing. Although there hasn’t been any real evidence of carbon leakage so far, nor of relocation of industry due to EU climate policy, concern relating to the competitiveness of European industry continues to be an issue. Carbon border adjustment is one of the issues that President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen promised to deal with at the beginning of her mandate. According to the Communication for the European Green Deal, the Commission will table a proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism during 2021.\nRecently, carbon leakage has been increasingly discussed in the context of cross- border power trading between EU member states and third countries. More than 80% of electricity imported to the EU originates from three regions: Russia, Ukraine and Western Balkans. In total, 13 EU countries are physically connected with 11 non-EU countries.' Imports have been 25-35 TWh?’ in recent years and net imports 3-21 TWh. In 2019 alone, 33 TWh’ of electricity was imported to the EU ETS region. The largest net importers are Finland, Lithuania, Greece and Hungary!.\nEmissions related to electricity imports are significant: emissions of electricity production for exports in third countries are estimated to be 26 million tonnes annually and about 10 million tonnes more than if the same electricity had been generated in the EU.\nEU power generators pay a carbon price that is reflected in the market price of electricity. The imported electricity is not subject to comparable climate policies and carbon pricing. Of the 11 connected non-EU countries, only Ukraine has some form of carbon pricing applicable to electricity production. In practice, the imported electricity carries no cost of carbon.\nUp to 57 GW! of new coal-fired power capacity is being planned or constructed in countries that are or will be connected to the EU power grids. This could mean an over 50% increase in coal capacity in connected countries as a whole. The increase of interconnection capacity would further expose EU power markets to imports and, consequently, to increasing carbon leakage.\nAs a reference, the power sector is subject to border adjustments in California and Quebec, the only major example of carbon border adjustments to date. The Californian carbon border adjustment system is based on an obligation to surrender emissions allowances.\nDivision\nCompany\nPower imports results in real carbon leakage\nGuarantee of origin is needed to prove the origin of imported electricity\nDivision\nCompany\n@fortum\nCarbon border adjustment in the power sector is more straightforward than in industry\nPosition\n3 (5)\nVarious measures can be used to mitigate carbon leakage, but the primary solution is to promote global regulation that guarantees fair and equitable competition for businesses. Above all, a more global carbon pricing and market is key to preventing carbon leakage. However, a unified global carbon pricing scheme seems very unlikely in the near future. Currently only about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are subject to some kind of carbon pricing.\nThe import of electricity differs from the importation of goods; hence also the solutions for carbon border adjustment in the power sector should differ from solutions in industrial sectors. Applying this mechanism for electricity is easier than for other internationally traded products, as flows of electricity are transparent and the relatively simple production chain allows better tracking of carbon emissions. As electricity is not subject to free allocation in the EU ETS, carbon border adjustment will not be an overlapping measure.\nCarbon border adjustment measures in the power sector would be applied for third countries that do not have in place carbon pricing corresponding to the EU’s emission allowance price. In such cases, electricity imports to the EU would be classified as an emitting activity.\nSome general requirements should apply in the potential carbon border adjustment in the power sector:\ne The solution should be European-wide and market-based and applied uniformly in all external borders of the EU The carbon content of imported electricity has to be proved reliably It should enhance the effectiveness of the EU ETS by preventing carbon leakage It should raise decarbonisation efforts outside Europe and provide incentives for the third countries exporting electricity to the EU to introduce carbon pricing and so to capture the revenue for themselves It should maintain full compliance with WTO and Energy Charter treaty principles\nIn order to promote market-based, competitive and transparent solutions, an additional prerequisite should be that all imported electricity is sold through power exchanges instead of bilateral contracts. This also ensures that the origin of electricity can be reliably traced.\nIn Fortum’s opinion, the most obvious instrument to tackle carbon leakage in the power sector would be a guarantee of origin (GoO) system, which would be combined either with an obligation for the electricity supplier to purchase and surrender EU\n12.3.2020\nPrimary solution to mitigate carbon leakage is global carbon pricing\nBusiness ID\nVAT\nReg.No\nDomicile\nBusiness ID\nVAT Reg.No\nDomicile\nDivision Company\n@fortum\nPosition\n4 (5)\n12.3.2020\nemission allowances (EUA) or with a carbon border tariff that would apply to electricity imported from third countries to the EU.\nThe origin of imported electricity for the purpose of carbon border adjustment can be reliably proved using a guarantee of origin (GoO). An additional benefit would be that imported electricity produced from renewable energy sources outside the EU could count towards the importing member state’s renewable energy share.\nSetting a requirement for establishing a GoO system in a third country may, however, require an agreement between the EU and the third country. This has been specified in Article 19 para 11 of the REDII Directive:\n“Member States shall not recognise guarantees of origins issued by a third country except where the Union has concluded an agreement with that third country on mutual recognition of guarantees of origin issued in the Union and compatible guarantees of origin systems established in that third country, and only where there is direct import or export of energy.”\nFor example, Russia has indicated interest in establishing a tracking mechanism for renewable electricity. The Russian Market Council has asked for offers from system providers and drafting of the legislation is expected to be done in 2020.\nWhen the seller of electricity proves with a GoO that electricity is from CO2-free energy sources (renewables, nuclear), there would not be any emissions embedded in the electricity and, consequently, no carbon cost for the sold electricity.\nWhen electricity is from CO2 emitting sources, the seller of electricity has to prove the share of various energy sources with the GoO and calculate the corresponding CO2 emissions.\nThe carbon intensity of electricity production varies significantly from hour to hour. A fair mechanism would measure the carbon intensity of imports in near real-time. However, for simplicity, a more averaged approach may be necessary.\nIf the electricity supplier cannot prove the origin of electricity with a GoO, the supplier has to calculate the CO2 emissions by using, for example, the emissions of the average thermal generation in the country or a grid average emissions factor (or corresponding to the carbon intensity of the marginal generating unit).\nCarbon border adjustment in the power sector could be imposed in the form of an obligation placed on the electricity importer to surrender EUAs to cover the embedded carbon of electricity. The advantage of this would be that the obligations on EU producers and importers are closely matched. This solution would require a revision of the EU Emissions Trading Directive.\nCarbon border adjustment in the power sector could alternatively be imposed in the form of a tariff based on the embedded carbon. The tariff could be calculated based on the average emissions intensity of power generation in the third country and on average EUA prices over a year (or some other period).\nTwo options for CBA in the power sector: surrender of allowances or carbon border tariff\nCarbon intensity of imported electricity is the basis for carbon border adjustment\n@fortum\nFor additional information:\nKari Kankaanpaa, Senior Manager, Climate Affairs, kari.t.kankaanpaa@fortum.com + 358 50 4532330\nPosition\n5 (5)\n12.3.2020\nA decision on an EU-level border tariff would not require unanimity, because trade policy is in the exclusive competence of the EU and subject to ordinary legislative procedure. A border tariff may be simpler than the obligation to surrender allowances, as it does not require importers to participate in the EU ETS. However, the border tariff would entail practically no incentive to invest in CO2-free power generation in third countries, as the incremental effect on average CO2 intensity would likely be too marginal to provide a measurable return.\nIn the case of power imports from third countries with carbon pricing, carbon border adjustment has to be modified if a carbon price has already been paid on emissions during production.\nThe EU has to ensure the competitiveness of European companies exposed to global competition. This does not concern only industry, but also the power sector. Cross- border power trading between EU member states and third countries is expected to increase and potentially result in increasing carbon leakage.\nThe primary solution to prevent carbon leakage is more global carbon pricing. The EU should collaborate with other regions in order to promote and implement ambitious climate policies and especially develop international carbon markets.\nAt the same time, various options to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism for the power sector should be investigated. Such a mechanism would restore the integrity of EU climate policy as well as incentivise low-carbon electricity generation in neighbouring countries and the spread of carbon pricing.\nA CBA mechanism for the power sector would be more straightforward than for industry. Carbon content of imported electricity is measurable, and the EU ETS provides an explicit carbon price at which the imports can be charged.\nThe most suitable instrument for tackling carbon leakage in the power sector would be a guarantee of origin (GoO) system either combined with an obligation for the electricity supplier to purchase and surrender EU emission allowances (EUA) or with a carbon border tariff. These options should be further investigated. CBA requires thorough consideration of its costs and benefits as well as of compliance with the WTO rules.\n1) Sandbag 2020, The Path of Least Resistance, How electricity generated from coal is leaking into the EU 2) Sandbag 2019, The A-B-C of BCAs, An overview of the issues around introducing Border Carbon Adjustments in the EU Carbon Border Adjustment: opportunities to complement efforts under the Green Deal, EURELECTRIC draft position, February 2020\nReferences\nConclusions\nBusiness ID\nVAT Reg.No\nDomicile\nDivision Company"

The Green Deal proposes to step up substantially not only the long-term climate objectives for 2050 but also the short-term ones for 2030. Considering the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of international partners, this is likely to increase even further the differences in levels of ambition worldwide. This trend can be assessed by the end of 2020, when signatories of the Paris Agreement need to submit their final NDCs as well as their mid-century strategies.\nIn this context, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness, since it contributes to reduce emissions at global level while maintaining jobs and investments in Europe. This will also be instrumental in facilitating the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate ambition.\nDue to the market characteristics of the sector, tackling successfully the risk of carbon leakage in the steel industry is particularly relevant. As recognised in the 2018 Commission Communication “A clean Planet for All” as well as in the 2015 Impact Assessment accompanying the Commission proposal on the post 2020 EU ETS Directive, the steel sector is the most exposed among all energy intensive industries, both in terms of possible impact on output and on investment.\nThe Green Deal underlines that the risk of carbon leakage can materialise in different forms, “either because production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambition for emission reduction, or because EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports’. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price and equivalent efforts, it is essential that the EU legislation adopts effective measures that avoid all forms of leakage in the short term but also in medium term.\nWhile free allocation is designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, a carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in trade. This measure should take into account the carbon intensity and related costs in the EU and compare them with third countries.\nThe border measure should be applied for a transition period until breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean products represent a critical mass in the market. It represents a broader contribution to a clean planet, as it is also an effective tool of political diplomacy to foster climate ambition in third countries so that deeper emission reductions are delivered globally. Furthermore, it would provide additional revenues to the EU that should be fully\nEUROFER AISBL ¢ Avenue de Cortenbergh, 172 ¢ B-1000 Brussels * Belgium\n+32 3 738 79 20 © mail@eurofer.be * www.eurofer.eu * EU Transparency Register: ID 93038071152-83\nused for climate measures, in particular for the development and upscaling of industrial breakthrough technologies.\nAn effective carbon border measure needs to take into account both direct and indirect costs of the EU ETS and to create incentives for third countries' competitors to implement similar emission reductions. As proposed by the Commission, it should apply initially only to few sectors and others could opt in gradually. In the case of steel, it could initially apply only to steel finished and semi- finished products such as coils, slabs, plates, bars, billets, etc, and be extended to steel input materials (scope 3 emissions). A workable solution should preserve also those downstream products that are primarily based on steel, such as tubes, fasteners and wire drawings. The EU could adopt “Agreements of Equivalence” with third countries that either join the EU ETS or have identical CO2 cost constraints for their industry, in which case there will be no border measure.\nThe effectiveness of the border measure will depend on the details of its design and its ability to tackle delicate issues such as the risk of absorption and source shifting.\nWith regard to the former, it is important to consider that EU carbon costs are applied to the entire EU production, while any border measure would likely apply only to the marginal tonnes that third countries’ producers export to the EU, hence having the possibility to absorb such costs throughout their entire production. As an example, an EU producer with a total production of 5 million tonnes of steel and an average carbon cost of 10€/tonne will pay €50 million, while a third country producer with the same total production but exporting to the EU 5% of its production (250,000 tonnes) would face only costs of €2.5 million, which are much easier to absorb. By doing so, the EU imports would still set the price at a low level that does not reflect the actual carbon cost. From the example, it is clear that a measure based on average carbon costs spread over the entire EU steel production would not align the true costs of EU domestic producers with those of imports, continuing to erode EU domestic steel producers’ competitiveness and render EU climate legislation increasingly ineffective.\nSource shifting refers to the possibility that a third country producer exports to the EU the low carbon footprint products while selling products with high embedded emissions in other markets. This practice, which is prohibited in the Californian ETS, may prove difficult to identify and discipline.\nThese complex issues need to be fully solved in order to have an effective carbon measure. Applying full auctioning as soon as the border measures is implemented would expose the whole EU production to the full carbon costs in the decisive period where breakthrough technologies are being developed and upscaled. As long as EU imports would be setting the steel price at lower value, this situation would cause the concrete risk of leaking emissions, jobs and investments to third countries, hence undermining on one side the environmental integrity of the mechanism and on the other side the social acceptance of EU leadership in climate policy. This would be counterproductive for the successful implementation of the Green Deal.\nAgainst this background, and considering all the elements below, it is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality:\ne A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection, since existing carbon leakage measures are already partial and digressive. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future. Moreover, EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation (i.e. the\nThe European Steel Association\n“trade” element of the EU ETS), but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets (i.e. the “cap” element of the EU ETS). A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies. While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU, hence better preserving the entire value chain. As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets. If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation. It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period, since there is no WTO legal obligation to reduce or phase out these measures.\nWhile a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire life- cycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border\nThe European Steel Association"

The reason for us to support a market-based approach is based on two main factors.\nThe first one is the price asymmetry that a tax would create if compared to a total alignment with the already existing EU ETS mechanism.\nIn order to be fair for all market parties, which would be:\n1. The EU companies now subject to compliance under the EU ETS directive 2. Importers of the future targeted carbon measures (which might not themselves be subject to the EU ETS) 3. Foreign producers of goods subject to being targeted by the Carbon Border Adjustment policies,\nThe price of Carbon shall be completely aligned. Applying a tax next to the existing EU ETS would create ‘de facto’ an asymmetry in the cost of compliance and, therefore, an injustice. Since a Tax cannot be \"recalibrated\" every day (as, for instance, is happening for the market price of EU ETS allowances), the party that will be subject to just one of the two measures will always be in a favourable position if compared to the other (this is due to the difference between the amount of the Tax and the ever-changing price of EUAs). The result would be the erasure of the fundamental scope and effect of the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment mechanism by recreating an asymmetry.\nThe second point in support of an EU ETS extension is the democratic aspect of the market-based mechanism towards all parties. This approach is already in place in the California Carbon Market whereas importers of goods or electricity in the state (from other states, fie. Nevada) need to buy the corresponding CO2 Credits as if the goods where produced in state or have the credits sent to them by the seller from out of state. All interested companies in the process have the choice of how to comply. Applied to the European case, the Importer could also become the ultimate responsible for compliance based on the level of their imports, while having the ability to procure the EU Credits (EUAs) for the products (and charge the producer accordingly if it deems it\nACO, AitherCO2 S.p.A.\nSincerely\nVia Antonio Tolomeo Trivulzio 3, 20146 Milano (MI) - Italia\nA the rc O, T: +39 0236586600 F: +39 0236586604\nwww.aitherco2.com\noperations@aitherco2.com\nnecessary) or leave the procurement of those credits to the producer without the need to anticipate the cost on his behalf (therefore sending both the goods and the corresponding credits to the importer).\nA third point is regarding COMPETITION and CARBON LEAKAGE. Implementing a CBA (Carbon Border Adjustment) with the cancelation of free allocation can be extremely useful only if the CBA applies to all semi-finished goods. The risk is that a strong unbalance in competitiveness will happen, as many EU-ETS subject products could be shipped outside EU (free of the EU-ETS costs) and being reimported after transformation. This will strongly hit the industrial base of the EU with high added value. We are talking about ceramics, paper, steel, ammonia and other important industrial production field.\nSergio Carloni"

The introduction of an EU-wide and WTO-compatible CO2 border equalisation will increase the accuracy of the costs of production and transport of goods and can prevent carbon leakage. This is because CO2 border compensation charges these products with a price that is also applicable in the EU, in line with the CO2 generated at the EU customs border. However, this CO2 price should take into account transport conditions in addition to production — these can be traced and verified, for example, on the basis of transport documents. The transport sector is a major emitter in the EU, accounting for 30 % of total CO2 emissions. The competitive disadvantage for EU companies competing internationally, resulting from higher environmental requirements in the EU, would be removed and transport by environmentally harmful modes of transport would be reduced.

Reaching this target is likely to involve a signifi- cant increase in carbon prices. Theoretically, higher carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage, or the relocation of industrial activity and its accompanying emissions out of economies with high carbon prices and into economies with low carbon prices.\nTO ADDRESS THIS perceived threat, the European Commission will consider the inclusion of a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the European Green Deal. This will apply a charge on goods imported into the EU, based on the emissions emitted during their production.\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION should not make the implementation of a carbon border ad- justment mechanism into a must-have element of its climate policy. There is little in the way of strong empirical evidence that would justify a carbon-adjustment measure. Assessments of current carbon pricing schemes typically find no leakage, while ex-ante modelling tends to find limited leakage, with results highly sensitive to underlying assumptions. Energy price differentials - a proxy for carbon prices - do not necessarily result in a relocation of energy-in- tensive production.\nFURTHERMORE, SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL, legal and political challenges will arise during the design of a carbon border mechanism. Choices would have to be made between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and mainly symbolic but more easily implementable solutions.\nTO SIMPLIFY THE design of a carbon border mechanism whilst maximising its benefits, the Commission has proposed focusing only on carbon-intensive and trade-exposed sectors. But it will be difficult to draw a strict line between covered and non-covered sectors. Trade devi- ation will potentially lead to lobbying and the temptation for ‘cascading protectionism, with tariffs extended to industries further along value chains.\nA STRATEGY OF tying future climate policy to the implementation of a border adjustment mechanism might therefore hinder rather than help EU climate policy. The EU should instead focus upon the implementation of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low-carbon industry in Europe.\nRecommended citation\nZachmann, G. and McWilliams, B.

To do this in an efficient way, the outline European Green Deal would increase the price all polluters in the EU must pay for their greenhouse-gas emissions.\nOne major element of the proposals would be the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism. According to the European Green Deal plan, such a mechanism will be proposed “for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage” if differences persist in levels of climate ambition worldwide (European Commission, 2019). The European Commission plans to make a proposal for a border adjustment mechanism in 2021.\nThe EU should not make the introduction of a carbon border tax (CBT) that would tax the carbon embedded in imported products* into a must-have element of its climate policy. The existence of significant direct carbon leakage - which is the problem a CBT is designed to address - is mixed, and it would not be straightforward to design a CBT that is both politically/legally feasible and economically/environmentally meaningful. Alternatives to CBTs should be considered (as we discuss in section 3). The introduction of a CBT would be more risky, and would bring lower benefits, than alternative approaches to encourage global decarbonisation and preserve the competitiveness of EU industry during the transition to a zero-carbon economy.\n2 Deconstructing the evidence for carbon leakage\nCarbon leakage describes the relocation by companies of their carbon-intensive production activities from regions with tight emission regulations (for example, high carbon prices) to re- gions with less stringent standards (for example, lower carbon prices or no price on carbon). In such a scenario, stricter rules on emissions in one place fail to reduce overall emissions.\nCarbon leakage deriving from more stringent unilateral climate policy should be differ- entiated from changes in trade patterns for other reasons - particularly the growth of imports from emerging economies, which increased the amount of embedded carbon irrespective of climate policy’. It is feared that, because of carbon leakage, stricter climate policies in the EU could lead to: (1) a loss of market share to foreign, more polluting, competitors, and (2) increasing emissions in other regions. This assumed leakage is at the core of arguments in favour of carbon border taxation (CBT).\nA50 to 55 percent emissions reduction in 2030 compared to 1990, as proposed by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, would be a reduction of about 40 percent compared to 2018, as 2018 emissions were already about 23 percent below 1990 values.\nThe quote continues: “This would ensure that the price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content. This\nmeasure will be designed to comply with World Trade Organization rules and other international obligations of the EU. It would be an alternative to the measures that address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU’s Emissions Trading System.” So far the European Commission has talked about an “adjustment mechanism”, which has no clearly defined\nfocus broader form of carbon border which could also be\nthe\nmeaning. We on a tax, a special import duty, obliga- tion to buy EU permits for imports or a domestic consumption tax on the carbon content of imports. Some of the arguments will, however, also apply to other conceivable mechanisms (including carbon standards for imports or no trade agreements with countries without proper emission pricing).\nThe EU’s territorial emissions were 22 percent lower in 2016 than in 1990, while consumption-based emissions were 17 percent lower in 2014 than in 1990. From 1990 to 2014, consumption-based emissions were consistently higher than territorial emissions, on average by 19 percent (Kartensen et al, 2018).\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nWhat makes the analysis so complicated?\nAn extensive literature has never been able to agree on the magnitude of carbon leakage for a certain environmental policy (for example, a €50/tonne CO2 price). Two extremes illustrate the uncertainty: in a worst-case scenario, an EU emission standard would kill a more-or-less carbon-efficient industry in the EU, leading that industry’s products to be imported from countries with less carbon-efficient industries (and possibly also causing substantial trans- port emissions). The EU environmental standard would lead global emissions to increase under what is known as the pollution haven hypothesis.\nIn a best-case scenario, however, an EU environmental standard would stimulate the development of new, more efficient production processes in a sector, giving the EU a compet- itive edge and eventually replacing inefficient foreign production by cleaner EU production - known as the Porter hypothesis°.\nIn addition, carbon leakage can operate through two channels:\nDirect leakage: in the short run, domestic carbon-intensive installations might reduce output, as output from equivalent foreign installations increases (operational leakage). In the long run, new capacities might primarily develop in countries with lower carbon prices (investment leakage). Both effects would lead to higher shares of carbon-intensive goods in imports. Indirect leakage, referred to in the literature as the international energy prices channel. In this situation, as EU climate policy leads to lower EU consumption of fossil fuels, global demand for fossil fuels would decline. As a result, fossil fuels prices fall. Lower prices encourage countries without climate policies to increase fossil-fuel consumption®.\nFigure 1: Theoretical channels of carbon leakage (+/- indicates positive or negative rates of leakage)\n‘Porter\nhypothesis’\n(-]\nIndirect\nleakage\nEnergy prices\nchannel (+)\nSource: Bruegel.\nThis distinction between direct and indirect leakage is important in the discussion of CBTs. A CBT might be effective in theory in mitigating direct leakage, but might have close to no impact on indirect leakage (Figure 1).\nA multitude of studies have attempted to tackle these complexities and estimate the magnitude of leakage. Methodologies used range from ex-post econometric assessments of leakage in individual sectors, to ex-ante simulation of expected leakage based on large global equilibrium models.\nThe Porter hypothesis, from the work of Michael Porter, says that well-designed environmental regulation can in- crease the competitiveness of firms. Regulation forces a reduction in pollution which might lead to improvements in the efficiency of resource use. The result would be to trigger innovation because firms are forced to become more efficient (Porter and van de Linde, 1995).\nThis effect is not restricted to energy, but might also be present for other carbon-intensive products, such as beef.\nUnilateral\ncarbon price\nDirect\nleakage\nPollution haven\nhypothesis (+)\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nEx-post studies of the ETS and other carbon pricing policies, have not yet found any significant evidence of carbon leakage\n€x-post empirical studies show no clear evidence for leakage\nEx-post empirical studies of the EU emissions trading system (ETS) and other sub-global carbon pricing policies, have not yet found any significant evidence of carbon leakage (Branger and Quirion, 2014). For example, Naegele and Zaklan (2019) used data from the Global Trade Analysis Project and found no evidence that the EU ETS caused carbon leakage between 2004 and 2011 in European manufacturing sectors. Dechezlepretre et al (2019) used empirical evidence covering 2007-2014 from the Carbon Disclosure Project, which tracks the declared emissions of multinational businesses by geographical region. Theoretically, multinational firms should be the most affected by carbon leakage. However, Dechezleprétre et al (2019) found no evidence that the EU ETS has led to a displacement of carbon emissions from Europe to the rest of the world. World Bank (2019) concurred with these findings and concluded that there is little evidence that carbon pricing has resulted in the relocation to other regions of the production of carbon-intensive goods or of investment in such products. Competitiveness may remain a major concern for policymakers but “these concerns should not be overstated” (World Bank, 2019).\nCostantini and Mazzanti (2012) used a gravity model to show evidence empirically for a strong Porter hypothesis - that innovation and productivity gains arise as a result of energy and environmental policies - in Europe from 1996 to 2007. They found that evidence for the Porter hypothesis varies depending on the sector and policy considered. Overall, environmental policies appear to have made EU exports more competitive.\nAichele and Felbermayr (2015) provided some empirical evidence for carbon leakage arising from countries’ ratifications of the Kyoto Protocol. Their comparison of pre- and post-Kyoto periods (1997-2000 and 2004-2007) found that the imports of a Kyoto-committed country from an uncommitted exporter were about 8 percent higher than they would have been had the country not committed to the Kyoto Protocol. The carbon intensity of these imports was about 3 percent higher.\nEllis et al (2019) reviewed the empirical literature and concluded that limited competitiveness’ effects had been found - any positive or negative effects have been small. The authors found that the only conclusive empirical evidence relates to innovation, where carbon pricing appears to have had a positive effect.\nThus, based on evidence from ex-post, empirical literature, there is no clear conclusion pointing to the existence of carbon leakage at the aggregate level. There might be several reasons for this, including that carbon pricing differentials have been relatively low so far, and that existing programmes have often included generous compensation schemes for exposed industries. At higher carbon pricing differentials, direct leakage might become more pronounced, either via the pollution-haven hypothesis or via the Porter hypothesis.\n€x-ante modelling analysis shows the existence of limited carbon leakage, which is mainly indirect leakage\nResearchers have also tried to understand ex-ante what the effects might be of a hypothetical future carbon price. Usually, they have used models® built on a wide base of socioeconomic, technological and other economic assumptions, and have then looked to better understand the effects of altering a specific driver within an economy, such as the carbon price. To analyse CBTs, global models have been used that offer insights into the interactions between sectors and countries through trade and fossil-fuel price channels. Such models have so far tended to find limited carbon leakage at the aggregate level.\nThe authors used a range of variables as proxies for competitiveness: net imports, FDI, turnover, employment, profits.\nUnderlying carbon leakage results are Armington elasticities, which specify the degrees of substitution in demand\nfor similar products produced in different countries. The error bands in estimation of these elasticities are very wide (see Aspalter, 2015, p55, who estimated the 95 percent confidence interval for primary metals between -1.921 and 1.211 for the UK), while most models only use point estimates to derive their results.\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nFor example, Bohringer et al (2012) summarised the findings of 12 advanced models. In a reference scenario in which a range of countries (Annex 1 of the Kyoto Agreement) agree a collective 20 percent emissions reduction, the mean average leakage effects are found to be 12 percent, falling to 8 percent with implementation of a CBT. This means that 12 percent of the emissions reductions achieved domestically by Annex 1 countries would be offset by an increase in emissions from non-Annex | countries - without implementation of a CBT®. The results suggest that a CBT could reduce the competitiveness disadvantages faced by the emissions-intensive and trade-exposed sectors. However, the global cost savings from a CBT would be small, with the burden of emissions abatement simply shifted to developing countries, exacerbating existing income differentials.\nAn Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development literature review concluded that ex-ante studies find economy-wide leakage typically ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent’ (Condon and Ignaciuk, 2013). Branger and Quirion (2014) performed a meta- analysis on 25 studies using 310 estimates of carbon leakage. They found a mean leakage of 14 percent without a CBT and 6 percent with a CBT”. A range of modelling studies have found that the indirect energy-price channel exceeds direct leakage (Fischer and Fox, 2012; Bohringer et al, 2010; Kuik and Hofkes, 2010). Modelling results show that while some carbon leakage can be combatted by a CBT, a CBT will never be completely effective in eliminating leakage, which will always persist to some extent via the indirect channel.\nBao et al (2012) provided a concrete example. They estimated the hypothetical impacts of a joint US and EU carbon tax on China’s emissions. They noted the presence of indirect leakage and found that the emission reduction impacts of a hypothetical CBT in the US and the EU would be “relatively small in China”. Increased emissions in China are driven by lower fossil-fuel prices, and therefore policies such as innovation and technology-transfer agreements would be more globally beneficial.\nFurthermore, McKibben et al (2018) analysed the effects of a hypothetical carbon tax (starting at $27 in 2020 and rising until 2050) in the US. They found no evidence of carbon leakage. If anything, the slight slowing of the US economy appeared to result in lower emissions abroad (negative leakage). Interestingly, in one scenario, carbon taxation revenues were returned to households by lump-sum transfer, as advocated by 3,000 US economists (2018). In this scenario, the addition of a CBT actually reduced domestic output, contrary to its objective. This happened because the CBT (a tariff) raised the price of imports for American citizens, leading to weaker demand for imports and hence foreign currency. This caused an appreciation of the dollar, reducing American exports. The effect of the CBT on net exports was thus negligible, but noticeable in terms of reducing the overall volume of trade.\nOverall, ex-ante models have tended to predict the existence of positive but limited carbon leakage at the aggregate level. Typically, the indirect energy prices channel dominates.\nEvidence of leakage in carbon-intensive sectors\nCarbon leakage, if it exists, will be dominated by relatively few industries. Carbon intensive and trade exposed (CITE) sectors are the most likely to be at risk of losing out, given the high carbon content of their products and their exposure to international markets. High trade volumes increase competition and make firms less able to pass price increases through to\nThis definition of carbon leakage is the same for the rest of the literature estimates presented: if one economy implements a domestic climate policy, carbon leakage would be the ratio of the increase in emissions outside that economy to the decrease in emissions that occurs within the economy.\n10 See footnote 9.\n11 The intuition being that according to models, CBT can have some effect in combatting leakage. Burniaux et al (2013), among others, confirmed this result. Branger and Quirion (2014) noted that computable general equilib- rium models dominate results, and that these models estimate statistically significant higher leakage rates than other models. The likely explanation for this is that in computable general equilibrium models, a large portion of leakage usually derives from the indirect, energy price channel (Kuik and Hofkes, 2010; Condon and Ignaciuk, 2013).\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nconsumers. The three main industrial sectors considered to be vulnerable to carbon leakage because of their participation in the ETS are steel, mineral products/cement and aluminium production.\nSimilarly to aggregate findings, ex-post empirical literature has tended to find little to no leakage in these sectors as a result of the ETS. For example, Branger et al (2017) estimated empirical regressions for cement and steel under the ETS and found no evidence that the ETS led to carbon leakage between 2005 and 2012. Healy et al (2018) found no leakage in the clinker and cement sectors. This is not surprising given the low emission prices and free allowances given to companies during the second phase of the ETS (2005-2012). Dechezleprétre and Sato (2017) reviewed ex-post studies on environmental regulations and their impact on particularly polluting and energy intensive sectors. They concluded that ambitious environmental policies can lead to small ... adverse effects on trade, employment” and that “the effects tend to be concentrated on a subset of sectors for which environmental and energy regulatory costs are significant”. They also found strong evidence for environmental regulations promoting innovation in cleaner technologies, highlighting the uneven effects of carbon pricing by sector.\nEx-ante modelling tends to estimate more significant rates of leakage for CITE sectors. Kuik and Hofkes (2010) found a total leakage rate of 10.8 percent arising from the ETS. Of this, the steel and mineral products sectors were responsible for 5 percentage points. More generally, leakage rates of between 8 percent and 90 percent were found for cement, aluminium, and steel and iron production when no measures are taken to address leakage (Cosbey et al, 2019). Such a large range highlights the high degree of sensitivity of modelling results to complex underlying assumptions, and makes the interpretation of results difficult.\nA literature review provided to the European Commission for the identification of sectors exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage found sectoral estimates from ex-ante studies ranging from 2 percent to 73 percent of carbon leakage (Oko-Institut and Ecofys, 2013). This range again highlights the complexities associated with modelling real-world policies. Oko-Institut and Ecofys (2013) attributed lower estimates to the assumption of continued measures aimed at protecting exposed sectors, while the higher rates seemed to be associated with rather simple modelling assumptions relating to underlying elasticities (eg homogenous products), leading to over-estimation of leakage.\nAt higher carbon prices, especially higher global carbon pricing differentials, any leakage would likely be in CITE sectors. This is certainly one reason why the European Commission plans to focus any eventual CBT on selected sectors.\nZachmann and Cipollone (2013) showed that on average, energy-intensive sectors generate fewer jobs and less value added than other sectors, representing only slightly more than 10 percent of EU value added and employment.\nThe literature also highlights in particular that there are many factors beyond carbon pricing that determine how competitive a sector is. By reviewing ex-post results, Dechezleprétre and Sato (2017) showed that aggregate competitiveness effects arising from environmental regulation are small relative to the other determinants of trade (infrastructure, geography, availability of raw materials and skilled labour). Depending on the type of leakage (operational vs investment), factors such as transportation, non-tariff costs, political risk, exchange rate concern, product differentiation, quality of capital, labour and energy available in an economy can all be expected to outweigh any leakage effects.\nSubstantial energy price differentials had surprisingly small effects on the location of downstream sectors\nGiven that carbon pricing differentials might not yet have been large enough to significantly influence competitiveness, energy price differentials could be used as a proxy for the expected effects of hypothetical carbon pricing.\nAldy and Pizer (2015) used US manufacturing industry data from 1974 to 2009, covering 450 sectors and sub-sectors. They estimated the effects of changing energy prices on domestic\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nproduction and net imports for each of these sectors, with changes to net imports considered as the ‘competitiveness effect: They found that for the most energy-intensive sectors (such as iron and steel, aluminium and cement), of the reduction in domestic production attributed to arise in energy prices, only about one-sixth could be attributed to ‘competitiveness effects’ Meanwhile, for sectors with median energy intensity there is no statistically significant effect of changing energy prices on net imports.\nResults therefore suggest that buyers of products such as steel and aluminium respond to changing prices, but appear to do so not by shifting consumption to foreign substitutes, but in other ways, including by switching to other, less energy-intensive materials or by using less of the good in the manufacture of their final product. The authors suggest this might be because imports are imperfect substitutes for domestically produced products, or that other trade determinants limit substitution possibilities.\nFigure 2: Natural gas used as feedstock for hydrogen production in US regions\n90000\n1.00\nmmm Gulf Coast (PADD 3) mmm WestCoast (PADD 5)\n80000\n0.90\n\\ Gulf West price (right scale)\n70000\n0.80\n0.70\n60000\n:\n0.60\n50000\nnq ,\n| | NLL 0.50\ni\n40000\nELT\nUT |\n|\nI\n| Mtl 0.40\n|\n30000\nETT |\nET TT |\nHTT 0.30\n20000\nET TT |\nTT TT\nHT 0.20\n10000\nPO\ni\nHW\n0.10\n0\nSource: Bruegel based on US Energy Information Administration, available at: https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet pnp feedng k a.htm and https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser.

PADD 3 corresponds to New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama with the corresponding price data from Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. PADDS corresponds to Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii. The corresponding natural gas price is for the same states without Nevada and Arizona.\nThe response of industry to changing energy prices can be illustrated with another example from the US, showing how industrial prices for natural gas vary significantly. One would expect that industries are more able to relocate within a country than between countries in response to changing energy prices. A major use for natural gas is as a feedstock for production of hydrogen, which is then combined with nitrogen to produce ammonia. This is done at facilities across the US. Figure 2 shows that in spite of an almost 50 percent decrease over ten years in the price of natural gas along the Gulf Coast relative to the West coast price, the levels of natural gas consumed as feedstock in each region have not changed.\nIn conclusion, while CITE sectors might experience some carbon leakage as a result of strongly diverging carbon prices, the evidence indicates that the effects are likely to be smaller than certain economic models would suggest.\nPolicy Contribution | Issuen’5 | March 2020\n3 Acarbon border tax would be very difficult to implement\nWe have argued that there is little solid evidence for a risk of dramatic carbon leakage. The benefits of a carbon border tax as a means of addressing direct leakage would therefore be limited. Furthermore, the implementation of a carbon border tax would be exceptionally difficult and potentially costly. Implementation could be done in two ways: (i) comprehensive coverage with all goods priced according to their carbon content, or (ii) limited implementa- tion with only some carbon-intensive goods covered. The European Commission currently fa- vours the second approach, but it will be difficult to defend a strict division between selected and initially not-selected sectors, and a gradual expansion of coverage would be likely, once an effective sectoral CBT is implemented.\nAcomprehensive carbon border adjustment\nFor a full-scale carbon border adjustment, it would in principle be necessary to establish the carbon emissions linked to each product. Ideally, all direct and indirect emissions along the entire value chain would need to be calculated. This raises a number of practical issues:\nCompanies might object to disclosing details of their supply chains which are often considered to be trade secrets; For some inputs including electricity or transportation there are big differences between marginal and average emissions” and it is very difficult to make distinctions. For exam- ple, all aluminium smelters in a country where 95 percent of electricity is produced from coal might claim when exporting aluminium to the EU that they only use the 5 percent green electricity share; A CBT will imply some trade deviation. Exporters can to some extent re-route their products from countries that levy carbon tariffs to unregulated markets. For example, steel exports from Ukraine to the EU might drop, but then Ukraine might export steel to the US, which in turn stops using its domestically produced relatively low-carbon steel and sells it to the EU*; A CBT can be a substantial non-tariff barrier. For small companies from less-developed countries in particular, it will be very difficult to comply with complex rules of origin, lead- ing to further sector concentration and discrimination against less-developed countries\".\nThe complexity for importers could be reduced by setting default carbon values for each product and calculating the border adjustment based on these, while allowing importers to pay less if they can prove their imports are greener. In our view this will not prevent objections (i) to (iii), as listed above. It would reduce concern about non-tariff barriers but would still\n12 Average emissions depend upon total production whilst marginal emissions depend upon the production source that provides flexibility to accommodate an extra unit of demand. For example, an electricity grid might on average provide relatively clean electricity but with flexibility provided by natural gas plants. Additional demand will then result in an increase in supply from natural gas. The operations of an aluminium plant would have low average emissions but very high marginal emissions.\n13 In 2018, the US produced 68 percent of its steel using electric arc furnaces (with a relatively clean fuel mix), while\nUkraine produced 70 percent of its steel using oxygen furnaces and 8 percent using open hearth. Rough estimates of the emissions associated with each production type are 0.2 to 0.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per tonne of recycled steel for electric arc furnaces, and 1.8 to 3.0 tCO2e per tonne virgin steel for oxygen furnaces (World Steel, 2019, p10; Carbon Trust, 2011, p11).\n14 Special provisions for developing countries may be implemented to attempt to solve this problem, but would in themselves lead to further complications in designing such exemptions. Most pertinently, such provisions would appear to violate the ‘most-favoured nation’ principle under the WTO.\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\ndiscriminate against smaller/less-developed players. The incentives for more polluting firms to decarbonise will also be reduced. A firm will receive no economic benefit unless they are able to reduce carbon content below the benchmark, taking into account the economic cost of self-reporting. Moreover, the setting of default carbon values will imply judgement calls similar to the benchmarks used for distributing free allowances in the ETS, which became a major lobbying battleground in Brussels.\nOne possibility would be to use the EU ETS benchmarks. Under the ETS, free emissions allowances are given to companies based on how well they perform against product- related benchmarks, with only the best 10 percent of performers receiving all allowances for free. Benchmarks (for example, 1.62 tonnes of CO2 generated per tonne of ammonia produced) have been determined for more than 50 products’®. Using such a well-established methodology, which has not so far been challenged at the World Trade Organisation, could resolve some complicated technical questions at the beginning. But over time the question will arise whether the benchmarks should evolve in step with EU decarbonisation\" or if the benchmark should be kept at its initial level’’.\nAcarbon border adjustment covering selected sectors\nPrevious discussions about a CBT within the EU have focused only on CITE industries (Mehling et al, 2019), in line with the general conclusion in the literature that a limited CBT is the most politically and legally feasible option, whilst also capturing the majority of any leakage benefits (Cosbey et al, 2019).\nThis is because most industrial emissions stem from very few traded sectors'*. Twelve sectors highlighted by the ETS as particularly polluting accounted for approximately 55 percent of EU industrial process and product-use emissions in 2018”. Logistically, applying a CBT only to these products would be significantly easier, as it would not require investigating complex value chains, and would avoid placing an additional administrative burden on all other products, which currently account for 98 percent of the EU’s imports in terms of value”.\nThe main problem with such an approach is that it could have a more damaging impact on EU competitiveness effects compared to no CBT at all. Putting a border-tax on specific carbon-intensive inputs (such as steel) could imply trade distortions for other parts of the value chain. So if leakage is an issue, a selective carbon-border tax could result in a situation in which instead of importing steel from less-regulated countries, the EU will instead import downstream products from the steel value chain (such as nails) from those countries. This would lead to a higher loss in terms of value added and jobs.\nThe Trump Administration’s steel and aluminium tariffs have shown the potential impact. A White House report found that domestic steel capacity did not increase after the 25 percent tariff was introduced on 23 March 2018. At the same time, a 10 percent tariff was introduced on aluminium. The reason for the lack of change in US production is that although imports of steel decreased after the imposition of the tariff, imports of certain steel products significantly increased. From June 2018 to May 2019, imports of steel nails, tacks, drawing pins, corrugated\n15 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0331&from=EN.\n16 If the benchmark is regularly updated in line with the best 10 percent of EU installations, the benchmark will\nsteeply decline when the EU decarbonises - undermining the instrument.\n17 Then trade partners will complain that the gradual improvements in technology they make are not properly reflected.\n18 According to a European Commission (Regulation (EU) 2019/331) definition, these are: hot metal, aluminium, grey cement clinker, white cement clinker, lime, dolime, sintered dolime, adipic acid, soda ash, carbon black, ammonia, hydrogen.\n19 Industrial process emissions are only a small proportion of total emissions. However, our calculations do not consider indirect emissions. Including indirect emissions from these sectors would also account for a significant proportion of overall emissions: see Monjon and Qurion (2011), who estimated that steel, cement, aluminium, and electricity accounted for 75 percent of emissions covered by the ETS.\n20 Trade data from UN Comtrade for codes: 2521, 2523, 2606, 2803, 280410, 2814, 283620, 291712, 72.\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nnails, staples and similar articles increased by 33 percent, while imports of aluminium wire, cables, plaited bands and similar increased by 152 percent”. The result was detrimental to domestic demand for US-produced steel and aluminium”. The Trump Administration has now decided to extend tariffs further down the value chain, illustrating nicely the theory of ‘cascading protectionism’*. Given the complexities of a more comprehensive CBT, it is not clear how easy it would be for the EU to engage in this game of chasing carbon down the value chain.\nThe closest to an explicit analysis of the magnitude of this effect we have been able to find comes from Burniaux et al (2012). The authors modelled unilateral climate policy by groups of countries (EU, Annex 1 Kyoto) with and without a CBT. They found that a CBT would have no effect on reducing the output losses associated with energy-intensive industries as a result of carbon taxation. This is because any international competitiveness benefit is outweighed by the increased production costs that such firms face (because of the increased price of imported intermediate goods). Their results suggest that energy-intensive industries might not actually benefit from a limited CBT”.\nLegal issues\nThe European Commission under Ursula von der Leyen has made it clear it wants a carbon border adjustment that is compatible with the rules of the WTO. The political reason for this is that the EU sees itself as a main beneficiary of the multilateral trade architecture (European Commission, 2015) and does not want to be seen to be undermining it. A CBT that is WTO- compliant is in principle possible, but rests on complex preconditions that will imply a trade- off between political feasibility and effectiveness”.\nJennifer Hillman (2013) provided an overview of the challenges a CBT would face at the WTO. Article II.2 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade requires any border tax to be implemented on ‘like’ products to those taxed domestically, and that the border tax cannot exceed the domestic tax rate (Article III.2). Determining whether products are the same creates a trade-off between ease of implementation and environmental effectiveness - for example, is steel the same product if produced by a blast furnace or an electric mill. The carbon emissions for ‘like’ products can thus be drastically different, and to be effective, benchmarks would have to be determined for a whole host of products and variations of those products. Until now, the WTO has determined whether products are ‘like’ one another by “examining their end use, consumer tastes and habits, and their physical characteristics, along with whether they compete with each other” (Hillman, 2013). There would arise a legal debate over how alike products produced via different methods are. Trachtman (2016) suggests that the best option for WTO compatibility would be a “product-based tax that does not vary by reference to carbon intensity of production but is set at a fixed rate for specified categories of products”.\n21 Both figures are compared to the figures from the previous year: June 2017 to May 2018.\n22 Domestic steel price increases because of a tariff on imports are not the same as domestic steel price increases because of a domestic carbon price. Under imperfect competition, the former will increase the market power of domestic producers, leading to higher prices but not massively increased production. The latter will put more competitive pressure on domestic producers, causing some of the burden of the carbon tax to result in lower rents for capital owners.\n23 Bown (2020) highlighted that even more cascading protectionism has occurred in the USA as a result of upstream steel and aluminium industries lobbying for antidumping measures. An estimated $5 billion of additional goods has faced antidumping measures since March 2018.\n24 The industries they consider as emissions intensive are: chemicals, nonferrous metals, fabricated metal products, iron and steel, pulp and paper, non-metallic mineral products.\n25 See Horn and Sapir (2013). Amon the issues they raise are principles of international allocation of jurisdiction,\nfears of evolution into protectionist measures, and providing evidence that any CBT would be internationally fair. 26 Such an approach would be difficult to reconcile with the WTO ‘like products’ Article II.2, as it is not the system currently applied for EU production.\n10\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nTensions between developed and developing countries in international climate negotiations have long existed; a carbon border tax might exacerbate this\nIn the event that a CBT was legally challenged and found to violate Articles II.2 or III.2, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade exemptions can be applied for tariffs that “protect human, animal, or plant life or health” or when they are related “to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources”. A CBT would likely meet these criteria, but explicit measures would have to be taken in the design of the tariff to highlight that it is implemented for global environmental purposes rather than to protect the economic competitiveness of EU firms (Hillman, 2013).\nFurthermore, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) rests on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” This implies that less-developed countries (and possibly countries that contributed less to the current stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) should not face the same mitigation burden as richer, developed countries. A CBT which gives preferential treatment to clean domestic and foreign producers might unduly affect developing countries. Tensions between developed and developing countries in international climate negotiations have long existed and there is concern a CBT might significantly exacerbate this. The EU might therefore wish to design a CBT which to some extent excludes developing countries. This would again raise the trade-off between overall effectiveness and addressing the concerns of developing countries.\nBGhringer et al (2016) showed that carbon border tariffs would exacerbate pre-existing income inequalities as richer countries shift the burden of emissions abatement to poorer countries. In a scenario in which OECD countries take action to reduce emissions and implement CBTs on all embodied carbon within imports, OECD countries would end up free riding on their own climate policies at the expense of the developing world, because of shifts in the global terms of trade. Bohringer et al (2016) concluded that the “main effect of carbon tariffs is to shift the economic burden of developed-world climate policies to the developing world”, while reducing the global cost-effectiveness of climate mitigation, based on numerous welfare estimations.\nForeign political issues\nThe impact of a CBT on exporter countries will depend on whether the CBT is comprehensive or limited, and on the sectoral structure of the country. There might be a windfall profit for countries such as Costa Rica and Switzerland with clean fuel mixes, while India, South Africa and other countries with particularly carbon-intensive industries would be disadvantaged (Figure 3). The latter countries would be negatively affected by a CBT and would likely strongly oppose such a measure.\nThe administrative costs of a CBT - especially if comprehensive, requiring the disclosure of value chain information - will be opposed by all of the EU’s trading partners. The implementation cost of such non-tariff barriers has been estimated at up to $70,000 for the certification of one product with a complex supply chain (Persson, 2010)*’. Calculating embedded carbon is an expensive process, which will favour larger producers in developed countries with more resources, benefiting from economies of scale.\nMoreover, a CBT might be seen as extraterritorial regulatory overreach by powerful countries that care a lot about their sovereignty. The narrative that the EU is introducing a CBT to trigger decarbonisation in other countries” is unlikely to help.\nA proposal for the EU to retain revenue from the CBT for redistribution to industry or the economy would be particularly damaging in terms of legal compliance and cooperation with foreign partners. Powerful voices have already begun to express such sentiments. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has suggested that revenues from a CBT could be used\n27 It should be noted that were the EU to pursue a more limited form of CBT only for particular heavy industries, costs may be lower.\n28 Ursula von der Leyen’s January 2020 speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which touched on a CBT, triggered media responses such as: M. Khan and G. Rachman ‘Davos 2020: Ursula von der Leyen warns China to price carbon or face tax, 22 January 2020, Financial Times.\n11\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nto fill the hole in the EU’s budget following Brexit”° (Krukowska, 2020). Such an argument blurs the distinction between a CBT as a measure designed for global environmental purposes and green protectionism. As an advocate of free trade, the EU must be careful to steer clear of the argument that a CBT is a disguised restriction on intentional trade. Rather than accruing to the general budget, any EU CBT revenues should be sent back to developing countries affected by the tax.\nFigure 3: Intensity of CO2 emissions embodied in total gross exports of final products in 2015 (in tonnes per $ million for the six lowest and highest countries)\n1,400\n1,200\n1,000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0 _— osm Eee\n|_|\neee eee ees eee\na\no mo}\no &\nc\no\n=\nx=\nn c\nn\n=)\nn\n= o\n=\n=\npad\nmw\noO\nx\ngq\nao\noO\n<<\nSource: OECD.\nBecause of the negative impacts for carbon-intensive exporters, the cost of compliance and fears of extraterritorial overreach, many of the EU’s trade partners will be firmly opposed to an EU CBT. Other countries have already shown their willingness to retaliate in similar circumstances. When the EU tried in 2012 to introduce carbon pricing for the full distance of flights arriving from outside the European Economic Area, the US, China and other countries quickly resisted (Sapir and Zachmann, 2012). The EU was forced to bury the proposal, in particular after reported Chinese threats to cancel Airbus orders” (Lewis, 2013). It is highly likely a unilateral EU CBT would trigger similar reactions”.\nThe US would certainly strongly oppose - US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already said as much* (Tett et al, 2020). One possible area for retaliation would be tariffs on automobiles, which could have a similar effect on the EU as the Chinese threat to Airbus in 2012. Introducing a CBT would thus require strong commitment and a coherent position from each EU country, in order to overcome the inevitable foreign opposition.\nA wide international alliance with other countries that might join an EU initiative to introduce domestic climate policies, together with a jointly-designed CBT might alleviate some of the concerns*. But some countries, including the US and China, might have structural reasons to dislike such an approach (BGéhringer and Rutherford, 2017). Therefore,\n29 See E. Krukowska, ‘Carbon Border Tax in Europe Gets Backing From Polish Premier, 6 February 2020, Bloomberg. 30 See B. Lewis, ‘Exclusive-Airbus to China: We support you, please buy our jets, 13 May 2013, Reuters. 31 Zhao Yingmin, China’s vice environment minister, said in 2019: “We need to prevent unilateralism and protection-\nism from hurting global growth expectations and the will of countries to combat climate change together.” See C. Cadell, ‘China says CO2 border tax will damage global climate change fight; 29 November 2019, Reuters. 32 See G. Tett, C. Giles and J. Politi, ‘US threatens retaliation against EU over carbon tax, 26 January 2020, Financial Times.\n33 See Victor (2015) for the arguments for an alliance, or club. The proposal from Nordhaus (2015) was to raise uni- form percentage tariffs on all imports from countries which are outside of the club, ie tariffs not linked to carbon emissions. This may be even more difficult to reconcile with WTO rules than a CBT.\n12\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nat best, it would require time, political capital and compromise on essential design elements, such as the desired carbon price, to develop such a coalition. At worst, such coalition- building will fail and leave the EU with the option of abandoning the idea of a CBT or doing it unilaterally.\nDomestic political issues\nDifferent industries and different EU countries have different preferences with respect to a CBT. Export-oriented industries and countries fear a CBT might trigger retaliation* (Nienaber, 2019), while industries and countries that fear foreign competition from carbon- intensive foreign suppliers might be interested in very strict border adjustments. The design of a CBT implies decisions about which products to cover and how to set the adjustment for different products from different suppliers/countries. There cannot be an objectively optimal set-up and the choices will impact different countries and industries differently. Spain, for example, might want to use the marginal carbon intensity of a country’s fuel mix to calculate the adjustment for electricity imports, to protect itself against imports from Morocco, while Germany might want upstream emissions in natural gas imports not to be covered to reduce its gas import prices from Russia.\nOn other design elements, positions will also vary widely. Particularly difficult questions include:\nWill CBT revenues be returned to trade partners, used in the EU budget, or given to EU countries? Will existing leakage protections such as free allowances and indirect cost compensation be immediately abolished, phased out, or kept indefinitely? How long will a limited CBT last? Will it be limited to CITE sectors indefinitely, or will revi- sion clauses be inserted allowing for the gradual extension of the CBT along value chains, turning it into a more comprehensive measure?\nThis suggests that compromises will lead to either reduced environmental effectiveness or less international/legal acceptability. Complex internal discussions will expend significant time and effort and risk political stalemate. Moreover, when final decisions are made on a CBT, so much domestic political capital will have been invested that it will be very difficult to change/undo the design of the CBT as the international situation evolves.\nTable 1 on the next page provides a broad overview of the complexities.\n34 See M. Nienaber, ‘German industry sounds alarm over EU carbon border tax; 25 September 2019, Reuters.\n13\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nTable 1: Advantages/disadvantages for different elements of CBT\nElement\nSelected advantages\nJustification for CBT\nCompetitiveness\nImportant in the domestic debate: Industry\nargument\nwants protection from higher carbon prices\nInduce stricter climate\npolicies abroad\nEnvironmental\nargument\nPotential to reduce emissions abroad\nWTO compatible\nNot WTO compatible\nTrade partners will be encouraged to retaliate\nBeggar-thy-neighbour sentiment\nImplies extra territoriality (no increase in\nforeign emissions) which might be politically\nsensitive\nCarbon leakage evidence is not clear\nImpede upon sovereignty concerns of other\ncountries\nViolates UNFCCC principle of ‘common but\ndifferentiated’\nSelected disadvantages\nCoverage of CBT\nComplete value chain\nSelected sectors\nFair\nEasier to manage\nMaximise\nleakage prevention / logistical difficulty\nDesign elements\nLogistically difficult\nTrade deviation (steel->nails); Incentive for\n‘cascading protectionism’ with CBT moving up\nthe value chain\nCompute exact carbon\nemissions\nEU product\nBenchmarks [1t steel =\n0.8t of CO2]\nWTO Compliance\nKeeping the revenue\nCBT to replace free\nallowances\nDefending the multilateral trade system is in\nthe EU’s interest\nSine qua non for some member states\nAdding to EU resources could help stabilise Some EU member states oppose giving EU own\nnational macroeconomic shocks\nresources\nGenerating revenues makes it difficult to claim\npurely environmental reasons undermining\npolitical and legal arguments for CBT\nInteraction with existing system\nFree allowances were very distortive\nAs CBT will not be perfect, companies will\nlobby for allowances\nMaintaining two instruments will be difficult\nto defend legally and politically\nTime-limited parallel scheme might be a\nsolution\nLogistically easier than computing exact\ncarbon emissions\nLargest and fairest effects\nLogistically difficult: non-tariff barrier, ‘trade\nsecrets’\nNo incentive for excessive polluters\nDifficulties over how to adjust benchmarks\nover time\nReduced effectiveness\nWill be challenged by trade partners regardless\nCBT to replace indirect ICC distorts internal market and international As CBT will not be perfect, companies will\ncost compensation\ncompetition\nlobby for allowances\nRevision clauses\nMaintaining two instruments will be difficult CBT might not work further up the value chain\nto defend legally and politically\n-> argument for ICC\nSystem will be imperfect at the start and\nRisk that trading partners see a limited CBT as\nupdates might be sensible\nonly the start of a new tool, that risks growing\nmassively into ‘cascading protectionism’\nSource: Bruegel.\n14\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\n4 Alternatives are available\nPutting a price on carbon contained in imports is not the only way to treat leakage concerns.\nCompensating trade-exposed polluters\nOne alternative is to compensate carbon-intensive domestic industries at risk of carbon leakage for the domestic carbon cost they face. This has been practiced under the EU ETS in two forms. First, many companies were eligible to receive free emission allowances. The complex design of the allocation rules was supposed to ensure that companies have an incentive to reduce emissions, while being largely compensated for the carbon cost, in order to remain internationally competitive. The system likely led to significant overcompensation of carbon-intensive companies, which passed the market price of free allowances through to consumers*. The system also caused a fight over allocation rules and reduced the incentives for a deep transformation of the corresponding sectors. The second compensation mechanism was that the EU allowed governments to return some national ETS revenues to certain electricity-intensive companies. The rules differed widely between countries and led to distortions in the internal market, in addition to most of the aforementioned problems“. Thus, we would advise against continued large-scale compensation schemes for carbon intensive producers.\nSupporting clean alternatives\nA better alternative would be to support low-carbon production of products that are linked to high carbon emissions in their production. The EU would provide large-scale public support to the deployment of green steel, green cement or green aviation. This would produce a double benefit. First, it would strengthen the long-term competitiveness of the EU in these currently high-carbon sectors. Second, it could provide the world with the technologies needed for deep decarbonisation. The obvious blueprint is the renewable energy revolution that enabled unexpected cost reductions in wind and solar technology, and perhaps to a lesser extent the electric vehicle and batteries revolution that has also been supported by sizeable public programmes.\nOne approach to achieve such support is payments for low-carbon production. For steel, cement, pulp-and-paper, aluminium and other products, the EU could define emission benchmarks for disruptive low-carbon alternatives (for example, less than 0.75 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of non-recycled steel, compared to an industry average of approximately 1.5 tonnes of CO2). Companies beating this benchmark would be given access to a fixed fund, potentially based on the auctioning of emission allowances that are currently distributed for free (at a carbon price of €40/tonne that would be €32.5 billion per year)*”. Companies would receive a pro-rata allocation from the fund based on the amount of emissions they save compared to the benchmark. The challenge would then be to define products and benchmarks in a way that would give companies flexibility in finding new solutions, such as new materials that meet the same demand, while closing loopholes that provide windfall profits to providers (for example, by recycling the same steel repeatedly and claiming the premium each time). The feed-in tariff system for renewables managed to deal with similar issues without being\n35 Zachmann et al (2018, p84) calculated that between 2013 and 2017 this transfer amounted to €45 billion. 36 For example, Italy provided no such compensation, while Germany returned €202 million in 2017 (See Marcu et al, 2019, p24).\n37 The EU ETS Innovation Fund already builds on a similar logic, using a share of the revenues of the ETS to support low-carbon technologies in sectors covered by the ETS (Article 10bis, §8 of Directive (EU) 2018/410). However, available funding will only correspond to the market value of at least 450 million allowances for the period 2021 to 2030, amounting to approximately €10 billion over ten years.\n15\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\nsignificantly derailed by WTO disputes”.\nIf well designed, such a system could increase tenfold the incentive for emission reductions”. Such a competitive scheme to reduce emissions and develop new low-carbon technologies would be much more forward-looking than current schemes that compensate emission-intensive producers.\nMeasures to create markets for low-carbon alternatives can also be developed”. Similar to renewables support, a quota system for green products could be considered, in which the government sets the percentage of the product, such as steel, that must come from low- carbon sources and then allows the market to determine the cost.\nStandards for products that can be used in the EU might be developed so that very carbon-intensive products are excluded. This might work best for products where the ‘dirty’ alternative can be clearly identified.\nContracts for difference are another support system for low-carbon alternatives*!. These guarantee to investors in green projects a certain carbon price, which might be significantly above the market price. Contracts for difference are not linked to a measurable output, for example tonnes of green steel. That makes the contracts easier to administer, but also results in only indirect incentives for the production of low-carbon products. So, an investor might benefit from the contract for difference initially obtained, irrespective of whether the green steel installation is fully used or not.\nPublic procurement represents a huge market in the EU for building materials and other products. Rules on public procurement should be designed in a way to better stimulate demand for low-carbon products.\nIf, as we argue, carbon leakage is not a massive problem for the majority of producers in currently carbon-intensive sectors, and over time alternative low-carbon products and production processes will become competitive, the best way to reconcile long-term competitiveness with decarbonisation becomes a question of timing. While a CBT or allowances and compensation might buy time for incumbents, they will have political and financial costs and will delay the transition. Meanwhile, support for low-carbon alternatives might speed up the transformation and provide the EU with a lasting competitive edge in new sectors.\nSupporting global decarbonisation efforts\nActive climate diplomacy should complement the EU’s decarbonisation efforts. Pushing for a price on carbon, for example, can be linked to preferential treatment for countries, such as allowing Ulzaine to participate in the EU’s Energy Union. Current work to provide technical and financial support to countries that implement carbon pricing should be continued and can have substantial returns.\n38 Some provisions - such as local content provisions - were however ruled incompatible with WTO rules. See https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds426 e.htm.\n39 Initial implicit carbon prices of renewables support schemes were up to €1250 per tonne in 2000\n40 See, for example, OECD (2019); Agora (2019); Neuhoff (2018).\n41 See, for example, Sartor and Bataille (2019) or Zachmann (2015).\n16\nPolicy Contribution | Issue n°5 | March 2020\n5 Conclusion\nCarbon leakage is real but limited and it should receive the political attention it merits but no more. All measures to address carbon leakage are imperfect, including carbon border taxes. A CBT could be introduced in very different ways. The EU will have to choose between more efficient but highly complex and politically risky approaches, and almost ineffective but easily implementable mainly symbolic solutions.\nDeveloping a CBT will however certainly expend significant amounts of human and political capital, whilst alienating and provoking international partners with whom cooperation is essential for successful decarbonisation. Moreover, given the predominance of indirect leakage, and difficulties in measuring embedded carbon from foreign producers, it is not overwhelmingly clear that CBT would actually significantly address leakage.\nThe EU should therefore be careful not to fall into the trap of viewing a CBT as a carbon panacea, and should not put a CBT too high on its list of political priorities within the Green Deal. The EU must first begin to develop a series of more effective climate policies, such as a higher price on carbon, applied more widely, and broader support for low-carbon technologies. Through such a strategy, Europe will be better placed to decarbonise internally and to spread this decarbonisation globally via the export of green technologies and know- how.\nWhilst implementing such policies, the EU should closely monitor the risk of carbon leakage. If significant evidence arises that it is indeed becoming a substantial issue, the possibility and feasibility of a CBT could be further explored. However, a focus on strengthening domestic policies, before resorting to a CBT, would hopefully offer solutions rather than problems to the EU’s international partners.\nReferences\n3000 US Economists (2019) ‘Economists Statement on Carbon Dividends; available at https://clcouncil. org/economists-statement/\nAgora (2019) ‘Climate-Neutral Industry (Executive Summary): Key Technologies and Policy Options for Steel, Chemicals and Cement, Agora Energiewende and Wuppertal Institute\nAichele, R. and G.

        "feedback": "Making an EU Carbon Border Tax easier with a Carbon Club\n\nA border tax must be built on the ETS; that goes for the level of the levy and for use of a possible link with ETS and CO2 markets in other countries. In the preparation of a carbon border tax, in my opinion, the following 6 principles should also apply.\n1.\tNo carbon border tax application for trading partners with its own ETS or CO2 tax, such as Canada, South Korea, New Zealand and Mexico. A list of these can simply be drawn up. The question then is what one does with imports from California, because that has a similar ETS system, which means for the producer CO2 costs. Such a list of countries is a good step for setting up a “Carbon Club“, a concept developed by Environmental Defense Fund. I am thinking of a ‘GATT’-like trade agreement, where products can be traded among themselves, without CO2 tax and in which countries. And in such a club, companies are allowed to use each other’s emission rights or credits to meet CO2 requirements. The club can then apply a joint carbon border tax on imports from third countries. A carbon club of countries with carbon pricing systems is also good alternative if the Climate Summit in November in Glasgow fails to reach common rules on international CO2 trading.\n\n2.\tDetermining the basis of the levy is not yet easy. The EU must request a carbon label for each product (x grams of CO2 per washing machine). The question remains to what extent the LCA and indirect emissions should be taken into account, where the EU ETS itself does not. The tax can also be levied on the ‘avoidable’ emissions just like the upcoming Dutch tax designed for the industry, additional to ETS. That may be fair, but it does not yet provide a level playing field for the EU’s CO2 costs compared to the competition. \n\n3.\tHere, the question arises as to whether, when introducing a carbon border tax, the EU should stop allocating free allowances at all and go for 100 percent auction. In doing so, it is assumed that the border tax already guarantees level playing field. The European Commission will need to investigate how quickly the percentage of allowances to be auctioned can be increased for industry and whether costs can be passed through. The industry will applaud a carbon border tax but against 100% auction. Auction is also not necessary for achieving the CO2 targets, with a decreasing budget, but in the long term there will also be no room for a CO2 budget.\n\n4.\tFor the level of the tax the best is to start low, say 5 euros per tonne to help acceptance and to star having at least a a price signal. A high levy of say 26 euros, like the current EU ETS price is of course more stimulating to reduce the CO2 emissions of the exporter. IF the EU will apply a 100% auction, than the border tax should be at least equal to the auction price.\n\n5.\tThe revenues of the tax should be spent smart. It is suggested that the European Commission should use the revenue to purchase EU allowances. This is not wise, as this leads to a higher CO2 price for the own industry than is necessary to achieve the CO2 target. And it frustrates the operation of the Market Stability Reserve, which could then bring extra permits to the market. I would rather like to divide the revenue destination as follows,\n1.\tpartly to the companies that export goods, with higher CO2 costs than in the country of destination,\n2.\tpartly to innovation funds\n3.\tpartly to the country of importation.\n\n6.\tCountries exporting goods to the EU do not have to pay the carbon border tax if they surrender commensurate allowances or carbon credits in line with the carbon label. The EU can use these credits to help achieve sharper CO2 targets, as en the same CO2 reductions are achieved as if production had taken place in the EU. And the exporter then incurs comparable CO2 costs at the border.",

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract This paper proposes the creation of a club of carbon markets (CCM), to promote deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by supporting the development, harmonization, and increased ambition of domestic carbon markets. To achieve its aims, the club would establish common or reciprocal standards for environmental market infrastructure, transpar- ency and environmental integrity; offer mutual recognition of members’ emissions units; allow participating jurisdictions to share experience and gain assistance in building institutional capacity; and promote domestic and cross-border investment in low-carbon development. Using a suite of incentives, including some from the trade arena, a club of carbon markets could serve as a powerful attractive nucleus for broadening the participation of jurisdictions in climate mitigation, much as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) served as the nucleus for broadening trade in products and services. A carbon markets club could be launched under UNFCCC auspices, but a more promising avenue might be to pursue the creation of the CCM as a complement to but outside the UN talks.\n1 Introduction\nWith the impacts of climate change already evident and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continuing to rise, the scientific and economic case for climate action is overwhelming (IPCC 2014). Because it is a global challenge, international cooperation to curb emissions is needed. Indeed, an extensive climate change “regime complex” has emerged comprising a wide range of initiatives and institutions aimed at reducing emissions (Keohane\nThis article is part of a Special Issue on “‘Alternate Structures for Global Climate Action: Building Blocks Revisited” edited by Richard B.

While a growing number of jurisdictions are implementing emission trading programs to cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, no part of the current regime complex has capitalized on these efforts to promote the broader expansion and coordination of such policies. It is a premise of this paper that mobilizing markets much more broadly, through well- designed emission trading programs that place durable, declining limits on emissions, will be critical to drive large-scale emissions reductions, spur the development and deployment of clean technologies, and channel necessary investment into low carbon development.\nTo that end, we propose a club of carbon markets (CCM).' The club’s goal would be to promote deep reductions in emissions by supporting the development, harmonization, and increased ambition of domestic carbon markets, including in fast-growing economies. Mem- bers would establish harmonized or reciprocal standards for monitoring and reporting emis- sions, accounting, transparency, and environmental integrity; create a shared market infrastructure to support the mutual recognition of emissions units; share experience and cooperate in building institutional capacity; and work jointly to further the ability of these markets to promote domestic and cross-border investment in low-carbon technologies.\nOur proposal joins a rich and growing literature on plurilateral climate governance in a fragmented or “bottom-up” world.” Within that literature, a number of commentators have contemplated linking carbon markets.* What distinguishes our proposal is the focus on carbon markets as a means of boosting ambition and participation in climate action, and the close * attention to the formation of a plurilateral club to foster them.\nWhile club members would enjoy the intrinsic benefits of linkage, we see the CCM as much more than a set of linking arrangements. We envision a CCM in the mold of plurilateral institutions, in areas such as trade and security, which jurisdictions have joined because the benefits of membership justified the disciplines that membership imposed. Just as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) served as the nucleus for broadening participation and ambition in the multilateral system of trade in products and services, the CCM could serve as a crucial and powerful attractive nucleus for broadening participation and ambition in climate mitigation.\nBy establishing a stable institutional structure with harmonized rules and procedures, the CCM could provide greater incentives for climate policy durability over time and encourage greater investment in low-carbon development in participating jurisdictions. Through mutual provision of technical support and capacity-building, along with a ready-made market infra- structure, the CCM could reduce new members’ transactions costs in setting up emission trading programs. The reputational benefits of membership could provide incentives for newly\n'\nWe use the term “carbon markets” to refer generally to greenhouse gas emissions trading (or “cap and trade”) programs.\n?

And perhaps most importantly, since club members would have an incentive to ensure credible carbon “curren- cies” among participants and avoid “carbon inflation,” the CCM could generate mutual pressure for greater ambition in future commitments.\nAlthough in principle a CCM could be formed inside the UNFCCC, creating the club outside the UN climate talks would likely be nimbler and more efficient, and could invite participation not only by national and regional jurisdictions, but also subnationals (e.g. states and provinces). The relevant qualification would be a jurisdiction’s capacity to ensure com- pliance with its domestic emissions limits and required carbon market infrastructure.\nWhile a club approach appears to be a more promising avenue than the UNFCCC for plurilateral cooperation on carbon markets—and indeed for greater ambition on climate—it is not a panacea. Each carbon market must first learn to “walk” before it can “run,” let alone run a relay race; particularly in developing countries, the initial focus must be on building institutional capacity to implement markets successfully, rather than quickly attempting to link with other markets. Differences in jurisdiction-specific political, financial, regulatory, technical, and cultural contexts will complicate club formation. Despite these obstacles, however, it would surely be easier to reach agreement on the infrastructure and standards for a common carbon market among the subset of jurisdictions with a keen interest in carbon markets. With over 50 jurisdictions implementing or beginning to implement carbon markets, such a club’s time may have arrived.\nThe next section briefly reviews the rationale for our focus on carbon markets. Section 3 presents key functions and provisions of a CCM. Section 4 considers participation and incentives: who would join, and why? Section 5 explores antecedents, drawing particularly on trade and security. Section 6 explores the potential relationship of the CCM to the UNFCCC. Section 7 concludes.\n2 Why carbon markets\nThe economic rationale for market-based instruments, including emission trading, is well- established (Baumol and Oates 1988). Market-based instruments are cost-effective: in theory, they achieve a given level of emissions reduction at least cost. By putting a price on emissions (whether directly as a tax or fee, or indirectly through an emissions market), market-based instruments force individual actors to internalize the cost of their pollution, which would otherwise be external to their decision-making. These instruments give all polluters an economic incentive to reduce emissions, spurring innovators to come up with better, cheaper, faster ways of reducing emissions, and rewarding less and less pollution. And systems that allow firms to “bank” reductions for later use provide an incentive for early reductions.\nA standard result from economic theory is that if the benefits and costs of abatement were known and fixed, “price” instruments (such as carbon taxes) and “quantity” instruments (emission trading) would be essentially equivalent; a robust academic economics literature considers the theoretical case when abatement costs are uncertain (Weitzman 1974; Newell and Pizer 2003; but see Keohane 2009).\nPractical experience, meanwhile, suggests a number of advantages for emission trading over a carbon tax, especially in a “bottom-up” international context.° Climate policy objectives are often framed in terms of limiting emissions, facilitating their translation into quantity\n>\nKeohane 2009. See also Wiener (1999).\nval Springer\n84\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81-95\ntargets (caps). Emission trading also provides a readier basis for cost-effective emissions reductions in a “bottom-up” world. Efficient allocation of abatement effort requires that the marginal abatement cost—that is, the cost of the last ton of emissions reduction—be equal across jurisdictions. (Otherwise, the same amount of abatement could be achieved at lower cost by shifting effort from high-marginal-cost jurisdictions to those with lower marginal costs.) Under emission trading, this “equimarginal” condition can be achieved directly, through linking: trading will equate the carbon price, and therefore the marginal abatement cost, across any two fully-integrated, linked markets (in the absence of exogenously introduced limits on trading). In contrast, equalizing the marginal abatement cost in a tax system requires explicit coordination—“top-down” multilateral negotiation—to set a common tax. Such coordination has been unavailing even in the economically integrated European Union.\nEmission trading systems have worked well in practice. Perhaps the best-studied market- based policy is the U.S. sulfur dioxide trading program created by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (Ellerman et al. 2000); other successful applications include the phasedown of leaded gasoline in the United States (Newell and Rogers 2007), the control of nitrous oxides in the eastern U.S.,° and the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer (Stavins 2003). More recently, the European Union’s Emission Trading System (EU-ETS) has achieved its targets and successfully reduced emissions, although a deep recession, a host of complemen- tary energy policies, and the lack of demand from other jurisdictions for offset credits has contributed to lower-than-expected allowance prices (Convery and Redmond 2013). Meanwhile, California’s carbon market has performed well since it began operating in 2013, and has established a linkage with Quebec. All told, more than 50 national and subnational jurisdictions with nearly one billion inhabitants have launched emission trading programs.’\nThe experience of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol is instructive—both for its failings and for its positive lessons. The Protocol placed legally binding caps on the emissions of more than thirty industrialized countries for the years 2008-2012 and established international market-based flexibility mechanisms to aid their achievement. The Protocol’s failure to include all major emitters under its emissions caps, and the hurdles it erected to broadening participation, contributed to opposition in the U.S. Senate (it was never submitted to that body for consent to U.S. ratification), and ultimately undermined its effectiveness in reducing global emissions.\nNonetheless, the Protocol provided positive lessons on policy design. Key system design elements,*® many of which are also incorporated in the EU-ETS, include:\nAbsolute, legally binding multi-year emissions budgets; Transactions limited to approved types of emissions units; Standardized, serialized, vintaged, fungible emissions units denominated in tonnes of CO2-eq; Transparent reporting of emissions; Transparent tracking and reporting of emission unit transactions, including explicit re- quirements that transfers of emissions allowances be subtracted from the transferor’s emissions budget account and added to the transferee’s; Accountability for emissions as compared with units held;\n® See United States Environmental Protection “NOx Budget Trading Program,” http://www2.epa.gov/ Agency, airmarkets/nox-budget-trading-program.\n7 The jurisdictions include the 28 Member States of the plus Lichtenstein, and Iceland; Switzerland; EU Norway, New Zealand; Kazakhstan; Korea; California; Quebec; the nine states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative; Tokyo; and seven Chinese cities and provinces with pilot emission trading systems in place. 8\nSee, e.g., Dudek et al. (1998).\nval Springer\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81—95\n85\ne “Banking,” i.e., the ability to carry surplus reductions forward from one commitment period to a subsequent period; and e Stringent, specified consequences for non-compliance.\nWhile the Kyoto Protocol was the archetype of a “top-down” multilateral climate treaty, these design features holds useful lessons for market-based policies in a “bottom-up” world.\n3 A new infrastructure: forming the club of carbon markets\nIn a “bottom-up” climate architecture, individual jurisdictions establish their own domestic climate policies, including emission trading programs. A core purpose of the CCM would be to fulfill the functions necessary to link carbon markets across member jurisdictions, encourage new jurisdictions to join, and ultimately increase ambition. In particular, the CCM would need to create the conditions for mutual recognition of emission units among members; maintain the market infrastructure necessary for trading; establish clear criteria for membership; and inform assessments of mitigation effort and ambition among prospective and current members.\n3.1 Mutual recognition on the basis of harmonized standards\nAt the core of the CCM would be mutual recognition of carbon emissions units among members. By joining the CCM, each jurisdiction would agree to allow entities with compli- ance obligations under its domestic carbon market to meet those obligations using emission units issued by any other member jurisdiction in good standing.\nTo promote the fungibility of emission units, the CCM would establish and maintain harmonized standards among its members. For example, the CCM would provide a common emissions accounting framework to ensure that “‘a tonne is a tonne,” including mutually agreed procedures for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of emissions. The CCM would also ensure the harmonization of rules governing the creation and use of “offset credits” for verified reductions outside of capped sectors.\nMutual recognition need not require that members adopt identical regulations. Even California and Quebec, which have linked their markets to an unprecedented degree, are developing separate offset protocols. To ensure flexibility while also providing clear guide- lines, club members might agree on a “minimum list” of regulatory design features or parameters that were essential for membership; a “negative list” of design features or param- eters that would be ruled out; a “positive list” of features that would be automatically accepted; and perhaps a final category of design features that would require case-by-case judgment by existing members based on an agreed set of high-level principles.\nThe CCM could provide routine, periodic review of member jurisdictions to ensure that they observed the agreed standards and guidelines. Such a review process could draw on precedents for policy surveillance in the IMF, OECD, and other institutions (Aldy 2014). Anticipating that political and economic circumstances might alter the willingness of member jurisdictions to stay in the CCM, the CCM would also need to identify rules for exit, including ” the treatment of banked allowances.\n°\nSee Pizer and Yates (2014).\nval Springer\n86\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81-95\n3.2 A shared carbon market infrastructure\nA second core function of the CCM would be to maintain the shared carbon market infrastructure necessary for trading. Thus the CCM would establish either a common registry of emissions units, or a formal means of communication among member registries, in order to facilitate the tracking of emissions units from their creation (either as allowances under a cap or as offset credits) to their retirement. To avoid “double-claiming” of reductions, the CCM would establish double-entry bookkeeping rules to ensure that all units, whether offset credits or allowances, transferred from one jurisdiction, are subtracted from the transferor’s unit account.\nIn addition, the CCM (or a third party designated by the CCM to act on behalf of its members) could perform other market functions such as administering common allowance auctions, maintaining allowance accounts for regulated entities, and even overseeing and operating a “reserve” of allowances to be released into the market if prices rise above certain thresholds.\nWhile these functions could in principle be provided through bilateral linkages, the CCM would take advantage of economies of scale in establishing a common carbon market infrastructure.\n3.3 Criteria for membership\nSince the CCM would not be a treaty, participants could include sub-national jurisdic- tions such as states and provinces, as well as nations. The key requirement would not be “capacity to treat” but capacity to administer a market—i.e., establish an emissions cap, issue and accept emissions units, require compliance, and penalize non- compliance.\nMinimum eligibility criteria for membership in the CCM could include:\nEmission targets defined as emissions budgets over some minimum duration, e.g. a decade, covering all or a significant portion of a jurisdiction’s emissions of one or more greenhouse gases, denominated in tonnes of CO2 or CO2-eq.; The use of emission trading to meet the cap; Jurisdictional law requiring covered entities to comply; clear, sufficient penalties for non- compliance; and institutional capacity to enforce the cap; and A commitment to transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification of emissions and transactions.\nThat the CCM would not be structured as a formal treaty might also increase the potential for eventual U.S. participation. In the postwar period from 1946 to 2006, 94 % of international agreements negotiated by the United States were “executive agreements,” implemented under existing authorities and never submitted to the Senate for advice and consent under Article II of the Constitution (Krutz and Peake 2009). In line with this trend, U.S. participation (including by U.S. states) might be more likely if a CCM were constituted not as a treaty, but as a voluntary association among jurisdictions with the capacity to administer their own internal markets, specifying obligations congruent with authorities afforded to the US. Executive Branch and the U.S. states by virtue of the Constitution and already-enacted legislation.\nval Springer\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81—95\n87\n3.4 Mitigation effort and ambition\nTo assure the environmental integrity of emissions units, CCM members would need to tackle the thorny challenge of assessing the stringency of each other’s emission caps—both at the time a prospective member applied to join (or, for founding members, at the time of the CCM’s creation), and periodically thereafter to ensure that participating jurisdictions remained “in good standing.”\nFor prospective members, a natural approach might be to conduct a case-by-case review (and negotiation) of the emission targets proposed by the jurisdiction, much as applicants to the WTO must negotiate a schedule of tariff bindings.'° Another model of case-by-case review is the process established by the UNFCCC’s 2013 Warsaw Framework for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), under which Parties may propose REDD reference levels, submit those for independent technical expert review, and respond to the published results of the review. In either case, the CCM could oversee the process of gathering and disseminating information on prospective members. Information relevant to an assessment of ambition would include mitigation policies and accounting rules, including the treatment of direct and indirect emissions from capped sectors and procedures to address potential emis- sions leakage. To encourage broad membership, the CCM might offer consultations to jurisdictions whose initial applications were rejected.\nOnce having joined, member jurisdictions could be subject to periodic assessments to ensure that they maintained or increased the ambition of their targets, as part of the routine policy surveillance mentioned above. Such a routine review would help to guard against the perverse incentive that might otherwise exist for jurisdictions—having linked with each other—to loosen their in order improve their emission units “balance of trade. sll targets to\nTo help inform both ex ante and ex post reviews, the CCM might develop a set of metrics for assessing “comparability of effort.” A range of approaches has been suggested in the literature, including evaluating targets on the basis of percentage reductions below historical or projected baselines, taking into account differing national circumstances; comparing targets to modeled emission trajectories consistent with a specified level of overall ambition; and estimating mitigation costs.\n4 Incentives to participate\nCrucial to the effectiveness of the CCM approach is the creation of incentives to encourage jurisdictions to join—and having joined, to comply with the obligations of membership. We envision the CCM as a true “club” in the economic sense: that is, a voluntary group whose members share a set of benefits from which non-members are excluded (Buchanan 1965).\n4.1 Benefits from linkage\nBy enabling trading of carbon units among a set of jurisdictions, the CCM would secure a range of benefits associated with linkage, including lower overall abatement costs (the\n10 See World Trade Organization, Handbook Accession the WTO, chapter 4, https://www.wto.org/english/ on to thewto_e/acc_e/cbt_course_e/c4s6p1_e.htm.\n\"\nSee, e.g., Green, Sterner, and Wagner, supra.\n2 See, Aldy and Pizer Aldy al. and Climate Action Tracker, http://climateactiontracker. e.g., (2014); et (2015); org/indcs.html.\nval Springer\n88\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81-95\nbroader trading area provides greater heterogeneity, lowering the cost of emissions reduc- tions), potentially greater price stability (assuming that price shocks are at least partially uncorrelated across jurisdictions), and greater market liquidity. These benefits are likely to be particularly attractive for “small” jurisdictions, or those dominated by a handful of emitters. While a small economy could face significant allowance price uncertainty in an independent domestic market, it could be more certain of prices with plurilateral linkages. Access to a larger market could also be significant for jurisdictions with only a handful of major emitters. For example, South Africa’s public utility, Eskom, generates over 90 % of the country’s electricity—making it a near-monopolist in South Africa, but a price taker in a potential CCM.'?\nAs in any trade relationship, other benefits of linkage would vary. Jurisdictions with relatively abundant low-cost abatement opportunities would value the access to jurisdictions where demand for those is strong. At the same time, higher-cost jurisdictions might be attracted by the opportunity to meet compliance obligations by financing lower-cost abatement opportunities elsewhere—while being assured by the cap that the resulting emissions reduc- tions would be “real and additional.”\n4.2 Reduced barriers to policy adoption\nThe CCM could help prospective and existing members by lowering barriers to estab- lishing carbon markets or improving the efficacy of existing systems. Jurisdictions with less experience in designing and implementing environmental markets could access capacity-building assistance, technical expertise and analytical support. Jurisdictions without capacity or infrastructure to meet CCM membership criteria might be able to gain recognition as “Observer” or “Affiliated” members with the intention of joining later.\n4.3 Enhanced transparency and MRV\nScholars have long highlighted the need for transparent and rigorous monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of emissions. Improved MRV helps jurisdictions understand the scope of the climate challenge, develop strategies to address it, and assess the extent to which policy interventions are succeeding. Robust MRV boosts public and private actors’ confidence in low-carbon investment—particularly when supported with a long-term governmental commit- ment to keep reducing emissions.\nThe CCM could offer policy and technical support to improve members’ and prospective members’ domestic MRV. Such assistance would be in the self-interest of all members, since it would bolster market integrity, enhancing the value of club membership (even for those not receiving such support). Again, useful analogs can be found in the work of the IMF and WTO to assist members in building technical capacity and improving standards for data collection and analysis.'4\n'3 Republic of South Africa National “South Africa’s Policy Interaction Experience,” Presentation Treasury, to the Partnership for Market Readiness (March 2013), www.thepmr.org/system/files/documents/Policy% 20Mapping%201L South%20A frica_0.pdf\n'4 See Aldy, “The crucial role of policy surveillance in international climate policy,” supra.\nval Springer\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81—95\n89\n4.4 Information exchange, institutional capacity-building, and policy coordination\nVisits to observe market infrastructure and implementation, periodic membership meetings, and other information-sharing programs would enable CCM members to share experiences and deepen market ties. Prospective members might be invited to participate in some of these, which might also be facilitated by coordination with other complementary capacity building initiatives, including the World Bank’s Partnership for Market Readiness.\n4.5 Enhanced access to low-carbon investment capital\nCCM membership could help participating jurisdictions attract low-carbon investment. That is because the key entry requirement for CCM membership—a well-designed cap and trade program—also enhances the returns from investments in emissions reductions. Mutual recog- nition and fungibility of emission units could help participating firms access capital in other member jurisdictions and manage risk. CCM membership would also provide a strong signal not only of a jurisdiction’s commitment to reducing emissions, but also its institutional capacity to provide a stable environment for low-carbon investment. Indeed, political leaders focused on strengthening climate action might make membership a criterion for investment decisions by export-import banks, overseas development institutions, pension or sovereign wealth funds, or other large public investors.\n4.6 Reputational benefits\nEnhanced international recognition, strengthened strategic alliances, improved interaction with regional partners, greater credibility in economic transactions, or better negotiating leverage in the UNFCCC might motivate new jurisdictions to join the CCM.'> Cultural and/or political affinities (e.g., the opportunity to learn from high-profile China or Cali- fornia carbon markets) might also lead jurisdictions to perceive it in their self-interest to join the CCM.\n4.7 Safe harbor from potential trade measures on carbon-intensive products\nJust as Parties to the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer prohibited trade in ozone- depleting substances (ODS) with non-Parties, various jurisdictions that have adopted or are considering carbon emissions limits have considered how to address leakage of emissions. “Border carbon adjustments” (BCAs)—requiring importers of carbon- intensive products (e.g., steel or aluminum) from jurisdictions without comparable emis- sions limits to purchase emissions allowances comparable to those required for domestic producers—have been discussed in the EU and elsewhere, and were included in proposed U.S. climate legislation in 2009. While a number of technical issues would arise in determining the exact form of any BCA, a growing body of legal analysis argues that appropriately-designed BCAs could be consistent with WTO rules (Horn and Mavroidis 2010; WTO and UNEP 2009).\nIf jurisdictions with emissions limits decide to impose BCAs on carbon-intensive imports, they would likely make exceptions for jurisdictions with comparably stringent climate policies.\n'S See Hathaway and Spiegel (2007); Rose (2009).\nval Springer\n90\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81-95\nIn such a scenario, it would be natural for CCM members to exempt each other from BCAs, on the grounds that participation in the CCM met the condition of “comparability.” Such safe harbor could represent a powerful additional “club benefit” to joining the CCM. And as the CCM expanded, it would not only increase trade in carbon emissions units and reduce cross- border leakage, but also contribute to freer trade in other goods and services by widening the circle of countries that could claim exemption from BCAs.\n4.8 CCM secretariat\nA small CCM secretariat might strengthen general coordination, facilitate exchange of infor- mation, and provide a clearinghouse for institutional capacity-building. Considering analogies in the trade field among others, the secretariat might also house analytical capacity to undertake expert review of the policies in member jurisdictions, facilitate access to indepen- dent expertise, assess conformance with the membership criteria, and promote transparency in monitoring, reporting, and verification. As the CCM developed, the secretariat might also facilitate deeper coordination among CCM members—for example through centralized trans- action logs, model contracts, uniform contract codes, harmonized registries, shared “strategic allowance reserves” that could be tapped in the event of unexpectedly high prices, or common mechanisms for settling disputes.\n4.9 Exclusion of non-members\nTo ensure that these benefits are exclusive to jurisdictions in the CCM “club,” members would agree not to accept emission units from, or allow the transfer of units to, any jurisdiction outside of the CCM (unless all CCM members agreed to accept units from that jurisdiction). Such an approach would create strong incentives for jurisdictions with domestic market-based programs to conform to or exceed minimum CCM mem- bership criteria, to attract greater interest in linkage and investment from other jurisdictions.\nAgain, the Montreal Protocol provides a model. Its Parties barred trade in ODS with non- Parties unless the non-Parties had adopted comparable measures. That provision created market-pull for more ratifications, better MRV, and a strong market force for the development of low-ODS alternatives (Petsonk 1990; See also Shepherd 2014)—exactly the dynamic that the CCM would seek to replicate in carbon markets.\nSuch a “free-trade area for carbon” should not raise any tensions with the WTO: we agree with the prevailing view that carbon emission units are neither products nor services and thus are not directly subject to WTO disciplines. '°\n5 Antecedents\nThe development of the CCM might draw on lessons from other plurilateral regimes. Here we draw three lessons for club development from the fields of trade and security.\n'© a full discussion of the trade implications of CCM proposal, Keohane and Petsonk See also For our see (2015).

In 1945, as part of negotiations on a postwar American loan, the two countries hammered out a joint commercial policy agreement on a range of issues including tariffs, subsidies, and import quotas, to serve as the basis for multilateral negotiations on tariff reductions. Following a suggestion by Canada, those negotiations were to start among a “nuclear” group of fifteen countries. In parallel, the U.S. proposed a larger UN conference to establish an International Trade Organization (ITO). By October 1947, the “nuclear” group—now numbering 23 countries, and meeting in Geneva—teached a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), even as they and others prepared to negotiate a charter for the larger organization. The failure of the United States to ratify the 1948 Havana Charter in effect doomed the ITO. But because the smaller GATT included provisions for it to take effect even if the ITO didn’t, the GATT was able to form an economic nucleus, using market access to attract, over time, broad multilateral participation in trade liberalization and tariff reduction.\nThe “start small” theme also emerges in the development of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which started in 1987 as an informal political agreement among G-7 countries to limit the risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).!® The MTCR provides guidelines for export license controls on missile and space technologies and products. Although the MTCR, being voluntary, lacks penalties for noncompliance, under U.S. law the U.S. government may (and in some cases must) impose sanctions on individuals, companies, or governments that export controlled items in violation of the guidelines. Sanc- tions include cutting off bilateral aid or arms sales for up to two years (Arms Control Association 2012). The MCTR has grown to some 34 members, with participating nations gravitating to it in part because of the perception that adherence brings market access.'”\n5.2 Second lesson: choose a legal architecture that facilitates participation\nThe GATT, as an “agreement” among “contracting parties” (rather than a treaty), could be implemented by the U.S. Executive Branch, using its existing legal authorities. While the GATT eventually provided the basis for the much broader and more formal WTO, it might never have gotten off the ground in the first place had it not enabled immediate U.S. participation by working within executive authorities. (The very broad Havana Charter likely would have necessitated Congressional action, but was never submitted to the Congress precisely because such approval was unlikely.) Similarly, the MTCR is an informal “under- standing” based on voluntary participation, which allowed it to start promptly with US. participation and has facilitated broader membership since.\nThe history of both regimes thus suggests that a CCM could start promptly and attract eventual U.S. national participation if it were formed as a voluntary association of jurisdic- tions, with obligations that could be met by the U.S. Executive Branch under contemporaneous\n'7 This discussion of the origins of the GATT draws Irwin al.

In the case of the CCM, such a voluntary approach would also facilitate a prompt start by allowing subnational jurisdictions to participate.\n5.3 Third lesson: seek critical mass\nThe GATT 1947, and the MTCR, both started small but with a critical mass of relevant actors (producers and consumers) in their respective fields. That “critical mass” enabled them to exert further market pull to broaden membership. The recent history of multilateral trade negotiations offers similar lessons. In the trade arena, prior to 1994, trade negotiations proceeded along the approach of a “Single Undertaking”, in which nothing is agreed until everything is agreed— multilaterally. (The UNFCCC largely follows that approach.) The result has been that in recent times, those least interested in trade liberalization have exercised hold-out power. Multilateral trade liberalization has sputtered. In contrast, more progress has been made through the WTO’s de facto embrace of “less-than-all” agreements on information technology products, telecom- munications, and financial services, where entry into force is contingent on accession by participants constituting “critical mass” (e.g. 90 % of covered trade.) These recent successes in trade negotiations demonstrate the power of starting small, while seeking critical mass.\nThe importance of reaching critical mass can be seen in environmental agreements as well. For example, the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer, which froze and phased out consumption of ODS, entered into force when eleven nations representing two-thirds of global calculated ODS consumption had ratified the Protocoh—making it economically unattractive for the remaining one-third of ODS consumers to ramp up their own production of ODS. Following this model, the CCM might focus on securing the participation of jurisdictions comprising a significant share (perhaps a majority?) of suppliers and demandeurs in extant cap-and-trade markets. The goal would be to limit the opportunity for a country outside the club to act as a large supplier of low-quality emission units, undermining the environmental integrity of the club.\n6 The CCM and the UNFCCC\nIn principle, a CCM could be formed under the auspices of the UNFCCC, either through negotiations under the “Framework for Various Approaches” or by building on the 2014 decision of the Conference of the Parties to organize technical expert meetings to “[s]upport the accelerated implementation of policy options and enhanced mitigation action, including through international cooperation.””° In this scenario, the UNFCCC itself could provide some of the functions of the CCM (e.g., a common market infrastructure), and might “take note” of a deeper plurilateral agreement on carbon markets reached by a subset of like-minded jurisdic- tions. In practice, however, the COP may not be able to agree more than minimal accounting standards to avoid double-claiming of transferred units.\nAlternatively, the CCM could develop wholly outside the UNFCCC, as a free-standing building block that complements the UNFCCC’s high-visibility platform. Here, the examples\n?0 See “Market and Non-Market Mechanisms,” UNFCCC, http://unfecc.int/cooperation_support/market_and_ non-market_mechanisms/items/7551.php; Lima Call for Climate Action, Decision 1/CP.20 para. 19(a)(v) (December 2014).\nval Springer\nClimatic Change (2017) 144:81—95\n93\nof the GATT, which developed in parallel with efforts to create a larger, more ambitious International Trade Organization, and the MTCR, whose initial membership of seven countries has grown to more than 30, might be instructive. Building on these models, the convening could be done by states, jurisdictions, or non-state actors. It could build on efforts already undertaken by national and subnational jurisdictions, particularly those interested in market- based environmental policy.*! The “platform for a strategic dialogue” on carbon markets included in the 2015 G7 Leaders’ Communique could also provide a basis for initial discussions around a CCM.7”\nIn turn, the CCM could facilitate both the achievement of members’ UNFCCC mitigation obligations and the UNFCCC’s transparency objectives. Since CCM membership would be conditional upon robust MRV commitments from members, the CCM would create strong incentives for jurisdictions with domestic market-based programs to ensure rigorous and transparent measurement and reporting in order to attract greater interest in linkage and investment from other jurisdictions.\n6.1 Role of the UNFCCC in enhancing market coordination\nEven if the CCM were formed outside of the Framework Convention, individual nations’ ongoing work to draft, and later finalize, their post-2020 mitigation commitments as part of any Paris agreement could provide a boost to the CCM’s genesis and illustrate a potential “middle way” forward. Buttressed by the technical expert meetings on international cooper- ative approaches established by the 2014 Lima Call for Climate Action, the submission of national commitments provides an opportunity for any market-interested country to indicate the preliminary criteria that external emission units must meet to be accepted for compliance in its domestic system. Such public transparency could also aid other nations keen to design their own compatible domestic systems, and thus could help guide the development and future membership of a carbon markets club. Indeed, among those “intended nationally determined contributions” for the post-2020 period submitted by June 2015, Switzerland, Mexico, Nor- way, and Lichtenstein indicated their desire to use carbon markets to fulfill their pledges and articulated preliminary criteria for emissions units they would consider eligible for trading.\nOf course, the CCM would need to be consistent with Parties’ obligations under the UNFCCC, including any agreement reached under UNFCCC auspices in Paris in 2015. The Paris talks, and the UNFCCC itself, will continue to have important roles to play. The UNFCCC gives a voice and standing to virtually every country in the world—even the least developed and most vulnerable—on a critical global issue. It also creates a platform (and an obligation) for countries to announce commitments, helping to drive ambition at the national leve 1.2\n?! Examples include the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) the Asia-Pacific Carbon Markets Roundtable; the “Under 2 MOU” initiative launched by the State of California; the Governors Forest and Climate Task Force C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group; and the World Bank’s Partnership for Market Readiness.\n2 See https://www.g7germany.de/Content/DE/_Anlagen/G8_G20/2015-06-08-g7-abschluss-eng. pdf.\n3\nThe November 2014 U.S.-China joint climate announcement and September 2015 joint presidential statement both illustrate this dynamic.

Moreover, existing UNFCCC provisions make clear that UNFCCC Parties also retain full authority to link their markets with similar markets created and administered by other Parties.”* In other words, no additional multilateral authority would be needed for UNFCCC Parties to fulfill their com- mitments under a Paris agreement through a CCM.\n7 Conclusion\nMarket mechanisms such as emission trading systems can play a key role in driving emissions reductions and low carbon investment at a scale and pace needed to meet the urgent challenge of climate change. To that end, this paper has proposed a new addition to the existing “regime complex” on climate change: a Club of Carbon Markets. By establishing a common market infrastructure based on mutual recognition of carbon emission units, with standards to promote transparency and environmental integrity, the CCM could facilitate ambitious emissions reductions and mobilize significant low-carbon investment. Properly designed, the CCM could attract participation by offering carbon market linkage, informational and reputational benefits, and increased trade and investment flows.\nWhile the club could conceivably be formed under the auspices of the UNFCCC, it need not be. We envision the CCM emerging out of plurilateral agreement among carbon market jurisdictions, following the model of the GATT and recent arms control agreements. The CCM seeks to emulate a lesson from those and other examples: To encourage ambition and cooperation in the multilateral arena, create an institution that jurisdictions want to join.\nAcknowledgments We are grateful to Frank Convery, Jos Cozijnsen, Janneke de Vries, Jill Duggan, Dan Dudek, Ruben Lubowski, Robert Keohane, Michael Oppenheimer, Bryce Rudyk, José Eduardo Sanhueza, Dick Stewart, Maja Valstar, Gernot Wagner, three anonoymous referees, members of the E15 Expert Working Group on Climate Change and Trade, and participants at workshops hosted by NYU, Columbia, Harvard, Duke, and OECD/IDDRI/ICTSD.

This would protect European factories currently in transition and therefore less competitive (because they are expensive) from cheap carbon-dependent imports. It is fortunate that Europe is so big that it can solve the supply of products on its internal markets even if the level of imports decreases due to customs duties. Together with me, I hope that other Europeans will be happy to absorb possible price increases in order to achieve the common goal of climate neutrality, but it is important to ensure a just transition for both factory workers to be retrained and poorer buyers.

One describes a world in which global warming is kept well below 2 °C relative to pre-industrial temperatures (as nations later pledged to do under the Paris climate agreement in 2015); itis called RCP2.6. Another paints a dystopian future that is fos- sil-fuel intensive and excludes any climate mitigation policies, leading to nearly 5 °C of warming by the end of the century””. That one isnamed RCP8.5.\nRCP8.5 was intended to explore an unlikely\nlitte,\ne)\nf\nae\n—\nFalling costs for generating clean electricity have led to a proliferation of wind farms, such as this one near Palm Springs, California\nhigh-risk future’. But it has been widely used by some experts, policymakers and the media as something else entirely: as a likely ‘busi- ness as usual’ outcome. A sizeable portion of the literature on climate impacts refers to RCP8.5 as business as usual, implying that it is probable in the absence of stringent climate mitigation. The media then often amplifies this message, sometimes without commu- nicating the nuances. This results in further confusion regarding probable emissions out- comes, because many climate researchers are not familiar with the details of these scenarios inthe energy-modelling literature.\nThis is particularly problematic when the worst-case scenario is contrasted with the most optimistic one, especially in high-profile scholarly work. This includes studies by the IPCC, suchas ARS and last year’s special report on the impact of climate change on the ocean and cryosphere*. The focus becomes the extremes, rather than the multitude of more likely pathways in between.\nHappily — and that’s a word we climatolo- gists rarely get to use — the world imagined in RCP8.5 is one that, in our view, becomes increasingly implausible with every passing year’. Emission pathways to get to RCP8.5 generally require an unprecedented fivefold increase in coal use by the end of the century, an amount larger than some estimates of recoverable coal reserves®. It is thought that global coal use peaked in 2013, and although increases are still possible, many energy fore- casts expectit to flatline over the next few dec- ades’. Furthermore, the falling cost of clean energy sources is a trend that is unlikely to reverse, even in the absence of new climate policies’.\nAssessment of current policies suggests that the world is on course for around 3 °C of warming above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century — still a catastrophic outcome, but along way from 5 °C (refs 7,8). We cannot settle for 3 °C; nor should we dismiss progress.\nPlan for progress\nSome researchers argue that RCP8.5 could be more likely than was originally proposed. This is because some important feedback effects — such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost?” — might be much larger than has been estimated by cur- rent climate models. These researchers point out that current emissions are in line with such aworst-case scenario\". Yet, in our view, reports of emissions over the past decade suggest that they are actually closer to those in the median scenarios’. We contend that these critics are\nlooking at the extremes and assuming that all the dice are loaded with the worst outcomes.\nAsking ‘what’s the worst that could happen?” is ahelpful exercise. It flags potential risks that emerge only at the extremes. RCP8.5 was a use- ful way to benchmark climate models over an extended period of time, by keeping future scenarios consistent. Perhaps it is for these reasons that the climate-modelling commu- nity suggested RCP8.5 “should be considered the highest priority”.\nWe must all — from physical scientists and climate-impact modellers to communica- tors and policymakers — stop presenting the worst-case scenario as the most likely one. Overstating the likelihood of extreme climate impacts can make mitigation seem harder than it actually is. This could lead to defeatism, because the problem is perceived as being out of control and unsolvable. Pressingly, it might result in poor planning, whereas a more realistic range of baseline scenarios will strengthen the assessment of climate risk.\nThis admission does not make climate action less urgent. The need to limit warming to 1.5 °C, as made clear in the IPCC’s 2018 special repor t8 , does not depend on having a5 °C counterpoint.\nAssess realistically\nThe plethora of future emissions scenarios poses a challenge to users of climate data — from policymakers to investors*. More than 1,200 mitigation scenarios were assessed in ARS in 2014. Another 400 scenarios were used in the IPCC’s 2018 special report on 1.5 °C of warming”. Most of these assume a base- line with no climate policy across a range of socio-economic developments. In our experi- ence of working with scenario users, this pro- liferation leads to more confusion than clarity, particularly in the absence of any guidance on the relative likelihood of each scenario.\nOther organizations present relatively few scenarios — the International Energy Agency (IEA), for example, now has just three main ones. Its Current Policies Scenario indicates what could happen to emissions with things as they stand. The Stated Policies Scenario includes current policy intentions and targets. The IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario reflects emissions in a world that is already aligned with the goals set in Paris’. The United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report takes a similar approach, compar- ing countries’ emissions-reduction pledges with global pathways that limit warming to well below 2 °C (ref. 15). These influential agencies\nParting of the pathways\nThe 2021-22 Sixth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will compare different types of trajectory from those weighed in its 2014 report.\nThe Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are a set of four possible climate scenarios for the end of the century’. The RCPs were used extensively in the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, but lack any consistent set of socio-economic assumptions driving future emissions and are simply intended to reflect different potential climate outcomes®. They include RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, with the number reflecting the additional radiative forcing in 2100, relative to pre- industrial times. Radiative forcing (in watts per square metre) measures the combined effect of greenhouse-gas emissions and other factors (such as atmospheric aerosol levels) on climate warming. Current radiative forcing relative to pre-industrial levels is around 2.5 watts per square metre.\nThe Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are five socio-economic and technological trajectories that the world could follow this century’. Each has a baseline in which no climate policies are enacted after 2010 — resulting in between 3°C and 5°C of warming above pre- industrial levels by 2100. In addition, the SSPs can be linked to climate policies to generate different outcomes for the end of the century (analogous to RCPs), with radiative forcing of 1.9, 2.6, 3.4, 4.5, 6.0, 7.0 or 8.5 watts per square metre in 2100.

These depend on which policies are enacted, where and when. In the upcoming IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, the new pathways (SSPs) must not be misused as previous pathways (RCPs) were. Business-as- usual emissions are unlikely to result in the worst-case scenario. More-plausible trajectories make better baselines for the huge policy push needed to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 °C.\n150\n5°Ct\nWorst-case\nno policy\n(SSP5-8.5)#\n100--\nIEA* projections\nsuggest a more\nplausible path.\n50\nHistorical\nemissions\nPledged Current\npolicies policies\n-20\n1980 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 2100\nLF\n*The International Energy Agency (IEA) maps out different energy-policy and investment choices.

Most users of climate scenarios care more about the world as it is now, rather than what might have been had global emis- sions not slowed over the past decade’. Users focused on mitigation are keen to capitalize on emerging opportunities such as cheap renew- ables, or to avoid overinvesting in stranded assets in dying industries. For example, they want to know whether the rapid cost declines in renewables might make investments in fos- sil fuels high risk. ARCP8.5 baseline renders these applications useless, because it implies that recent climate policies and technological progress are halted or even reversed.\nFor policymakers, mitigation policies that depend on the assumptions underlying high-emission baseline scenarios such as RCP8.5 will seem exorbitant, because they do notincorporate the plummeting costs of many low-carbon technologies over the past decade. The marginal investments required to move from 3 °C of warming to well below 2 °C (the main Paris goal) will be much less than mov- ing from 5 °C to well below 2 °C. A narrative of progress and opportunity can make the Paris targets seem feasible, rather than seemingly impossible.\nTowards risk-based scenarios\nThose who are tasked with taking climate action on the basis of information from model scenarios are increasingly calling for a more risk-based approach to help with adaptation and mitigation”. This approach accounts for the relative likelihood of different outcomes.\nFirst, new generation\n620 | Nature | Vol577 | 30 January 2020\n4°Cc\nUnlikely\nAverage no policy |\nReversal of\n(SSP3-7.0)\nsome current\nJ policies\nLikely\nWeak mitigation | Given current\n(SSP4-6.0)\npolicies\n2.5 °C\nModest mitigation\n(SSP2-4.5)\n1.5 °C\nMitigation required to meet Paris goals\n(SSP1-1.9)\nControversially, it requires researchers to assign probabilities to scenarios”. Critics don’t want to do this, because many see it as an arbitrary process. But when specialists refuse to assign probabilities, users often do so themselves. Most do so poorly because they do not have a deep understanding of the assumptions that underpin these scenarios. Initially, the probabilities do not need\n“Overstating the likelihood of extreme climate impacts can make mitigation seem harder thanit actually is.”\nto be elaborate, and could even just iden- tify the most likely scenario resulting from current energy-system trends and policies. Now, scenarios are selected on the basis of their climate outcomes in 2100, not their likelihoods. More complex probabilistic approaches would require modellers to work differently”. For example, they would need to forge new alliances with those in the social sciences® and involve policymakers, inves- tors and industry\".\nThis will require years of work. Meanwhile, three steps should be taken over the next year in the lead-up to AR6, to set the climate com- munity on the right road. The latest genera- tion of climate models has just come out, and many researchers are now selecting which future emissions scenarios to use in studies. the of scenarios called\n4 Highly unlikely\nOften wrongly\n|\nused as ‘business\nJ as usual’\n© 2020 Springer Nature Limited.

Simplify complex processes and reduce unnecessary administrative and_ financial obligations:\nThe upcoming new Commission has made a commitment to simplify and streamline rules and its ambition is to reduce unnecessary administrative burden by 25% for the new legislative terms. The draft implementing act (IA) on authorising CBAM declarants is describing a complex process and reporting mechanisms with a number of administrative and financial requirements for market participants who will be subject to the CBAM requirements as future importers and declarants. The EC needs to ensure that the rules that will be put in place are not disproportionate and do not add administrative burdens on customers, especially for smaller companies or new entrants to the market.\nMost notably, the [A on CBAM declarants in Article 11 puts in place further details on the application for authorisation of future declarants as well as a number of processes and requirements for financial and operational capacity proofs, etc.\n'\\} nemolink\n(>\nNeuConnect\ntL oe ElecLink\nTF,\nAbout us\nLinea\nnationalgrid\n(rm\nNeuConnect\nEL oe ElecLink\nTF,\nIn that context, it should be noted also that in particular Electricity Transmission System Operators and Interconnector TSOs are entities with a particular status when it comes to legal obligations for ensuring security of supply and efficient market operations at all times.\nWith respect to electricity, TSOs are responsible to keep the lights on and to facilitate markets but they are not as such market participants and should not be perceived as energy traders on the market since they do operate in specific circumstances, regulated by European and national legislation, in view of ensuring the balance of the grid and avoiding blackouts. There should not be a need for TSOs to have to prove their financial and operational capacity as described in Article 11 IA. TSOs already have to provide the proof of their financial capacity etc. according to Article 44 of Directive 2019/944 (Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (recast)) and for GB Interconnectors respectively according to the GB Electricity Interconnector Standard Licence Conditions requirements. In the case where TSOs fall in scope of the CBAM obligations, there should be a process that ensures automatic recognition of these entities as CBAM declarants to avoid unnecessary administrative burden.\nArticle 11.3 of the IA stipulates that ‘when examining the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the competent authority shall take into account the specific characteristics of the applicant, including the information on the estimated volume of imports provided by the applicant in accordance with Article 5(5), point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.’\nArticle 5.5(g) of the CBAM Regulation sets out the requirements that inter alia, the application for an authorisation shall include the following information about the applicant: ‘the estimated monetary value and volume of imports of goods into the customs territory of the Union by type of goods, for the calendar year during which the application is submitted, and for the following calendar year.’\nThe issue with this requirement is whether market participants (especially new entry market participants) would be able to estimate import volumes for the next two years. Electricity trade is driven by the market and can vary day to day. In particular, the day ahead market can be volatile due to the dynamic nature of the grid and its components. Electricity demand can fluctuate significantly due to factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and economic activity, making it difficult to accurately forecast how much electricity will be needed. Similarly, the availability of electricity generation can change due to unexpected outages, maintenance schedules, or changes in renewable energy production (e.g., solar and wind generation being dependent on weather). Moreover, electricity trading is done via auctions (explicit auctions for capacity and energy auctions for electricity if they trade their energy volumes via power exchanges). This means the volumes of trade for each market participant can depend and vary based on the respective trading strategies and the market competition at the time of the auctions. All of the above would make it very difficult for market participants to estimate import volumes for future years. We would welcome further clarification on the frequency with which electricity importers are permitted to update their estimated values after submission.\nMoreover, we would like to point out that the requirements in Article 5.5(f) of the CBAM Regulation as below could be potentially quite difficult to fulfil in certain cases, i.e. point ‘(f) regarding information necessary to demonstrate the applicant’s financial and operational capacity to fulfil its obligations under this Regulation and, if decided by the competent authority on the basis of a risk assessment, supporting documents confirming that information, such as the profit and loss account and the balance sheet for up to the last three financial years for which the accounts were closed.’\n'\\} nemolink\nLinea\nnationalgrid\n(rm\nNeuConnect\nL oe ElecLink\nTF,\nThe issue here is whether newer customers would be able to demonstrate the three-year financial statement obligations. Newly established companies may not have had three years of financial records to meet the legislative requirements. The guarantees will create a financial barrier to entry for smaller customers, on top of other fees and collateral requirements needed to trade electricity.\nFurther amendments of Articles 5.5 (f) and (g) to provide the necessary flexibility for all types of market participants in electricity markets would be beneficial as otherwise it would create additional barriers for market participants/customers (especially new market entries) to be able to set up as an authorised CBAM declarant.\n2. Provide timely clarification on the requirements for guarantees and CBAM certificates\nThe CBAM Regulation asks the competent authority to require a guarantee if the CBAM declarant applicant was not established throughout the 2 financial years preceding the year when the application was submitted.\nFirst, the guarantees could create a financial barrier to entry for smaller market participants, on top of other fees and collateral requirements needed to trade electricity. This could have potentially serious negative impacts on market liquidity. Particularly, Article 15(2) provides that the guarantee must cover the estimated obligation of CBAM certificates based on the imported goods. Given the nature of the electricity market, where volumes and prices can fluctuate significantly, the calculation of estimated obligations may not always align with actual import volumes. This could prevent new entry applicants into the market due to the provision of a guarantee and their role in covering estimated obligation of CBAM certificates, therefore creating another barrier to trade. Second, the EC is working on technical studies that should provide further clarity for third countries to apply the CBAM for electricity e.g. on electricity as a CBAM good, on the carbon price paid in third countries and on default values amongst others. However, according to the latest expert group meeting that took place in November 2024, these studies will come out very late in time and some might not even be finalised in time for the CBAM financial start (1 January 2026). The same applies with regards to implementing acts that have been postponed e.g. the implementing act on carbon price and price certificates (Q4/2025).\nBecause of uncertainties on how emissions will be taken into account for electricity, it will be challenging, if not impossible, for customers importing electricity to have clarity on how many CBAM certificates they will need to buy in advance and, in case they need a guarantee, to have this guarantee at a “level sufficient to cover the number of CBAM certificates (...) they would have to surrender” (Article 15 of the IA).\nEnsure that reporting requirements are fit for purpose for the electricity sector: netting of interconnectors capacities in different timeframes and scales should be allowed to avoid importers having to pay for CBAM on volumes that have not been physically delivered into the EU\nAccording to the GB Electricity Interconnector Standard Licence Conditions? (condition 11A(3)(a)), GB interconnectors are required to maximise their available interconnector capacity, which includes ‘the netting of capacity of any power flow in the opposite direction over the interconnector.’\n'\\} nemolink\n1 Electricity Interconnector Standard Licence Conditions 03 08 2021 (ofgem.gov.uk)\nLinea\nnationalgrid\n(rm\nNeuConnect\nEL oe ElecLink\nTF,\nThis means that during a given settlement period, customer requests to import electricity into an EU country from GB must be offset against customer requests to flow in the opposite direction.”\nHowever, as per Article 8 of the (IA) on authorising CBAM declarants, and Article 5(4) of the CBAM Regulation, it is unclear whether an importer’s CBAM liabilities will be based on the pre-netted position (i.e., all nominated flows on an interconnector that would export power into the EU) or the final net-position on the interconnector (i.e., only the power which is physically exported to EU Member States).\nThis creates significant issues that need to be resolved such inter alia:\nas [e) If an importer’s CBAM liabilities will be based on the pre-netted position (i.e., all nominated flows on an interconnector that would export power into the EU), this means that due to the way electricity trading and netting on interconnectors works, the importer may become liable for quantities of electricity imports which may not have been imported in the end due to real-time outcomes. Netting should be applied on the hourly resolution per market participant across the three timescales that are being traded on the interconnector in order to avoid importers having to pay for CBAM on the volumes that have not been physically delivered into EU due to changing positions prior to delivery. Article 8 of the IA should therefore be amended to clarify the conditions for netting of interconnector capacities and to clarify that only volumes after netting should be subject to CBAM reporting in order to avoid importers having to pay for CBAM on the volumes that have not been physically delivered into EU due to changing positions prior to delivery (See in the Annex a more detailed explanation).\nAnnex: In simple terms, how netting works in practice:\nCustomers can buy capacity on the interconnectors across 3 timeframes: Long-Term (auctions from 2 years ahead and up to a month/week before delivery), Day-Ahead (auctions on the day before delivery) and Intraday for within day delivery. Capacity is sold separately for each direction of a border (e.g.: BE to GB or GB to BE on the Nemo Link Interconnector).\nAfter a customer has won capacity in an auction, they will have the option of nominating their capacity. If a customer buys capacity but then later decides not to nominate, there will be no physical flow as a result of the capacity sale for that particular customer. If they do wish to nominate, they can do so for their capacity they bought from different timeframes. Each timeframe has its own nomination deadlines and therefore there are separate nomination gates for Long-Term (LT), Day Ahead (DA) and Intraday (ID) process. For an example, a customer nominated 100 MW of their Long- Term capacity for direction BE a GB for a certain delivery hour of the day (this process takes place on the day before delivery), then on the delivery day, subsequently nominated 150MW of their Intraday capacity for direction GB a BE for the same hour. This would then result in a net position of 50 MW final nominations GB a BE for this customer. The customer would then need to ensure that they also\n? For example, request to flow 250MW from GB to FR would be offset against requests to flow electricity in a the opposite direction during the same settlement period (10OMW from FR to GB), determining the overall net- position and direction of the flow on the interconnector (net LSOMW GB to FR direction).\n'\\} nemolink\nLinea\nnationalgrid\n(rm\nNeuConnect\n5 — ElecLink\nS&S\nsecured the electricity in both markets to deliver their final position that had been nominated on the Nemo Link interconnector.\nAs a result of the netting process, a customer should be subject to CBAM obligations for the SOMW of import from GB to BE only and not for the 1SOMW that they nominated for the intraday timeframe in the GB to BE direction due to the nominations in the opposite direction that they already made for the Long-Term timeframe.\nEXAMPLE: Customer A nominates for the same delivery hour 09:00-10:00 CET day D in\ntwo different timeframes\n100 MW of their Long-Term (LT) rights from BE to GB (at gate closure on day D-1) and 150 MW of their Intraday (ID) rights from GB to BE (at gate closure on day D ),\n> results in their netted flow of 50 MW GB->BE as their final position (before losses applied).\n100 MW of LT rights nominated\nSILA\n150 MW of ID rights nominated\ntt\nUS\n50 MW in final position at ID stage\nWe remain available for discussion in case of further questions.

An elaboration of the individual points can be found in the following corresponding paragraphs.\n1) Timing with the authorization process: Companies face po- tential delays with authorization, as they are informed of CBAM reporting obligations only after importing goods, ne- cessitating solutions like retroactive authorization. 2) Threshold of one tonne: The one-tonne threshold is unclear in its application and implications, requiring further clarifi- cation due to its seemingly low value. 3) Concerns about compliance and authorization: Companies risk losing CBAM importer authorization due to difficulties in obtaining emissions data, highlighting the need for tai- lored compliance mechanisms, especially for SMEs. 4) Administrative capacities: The requirement for proving suf- ficient administrative capacity poses significant challenges for SMEs, necessitating clear criteria for assessment. 5) Revocation of authorization: There is a contradiction re- garding the revocation and reapplication of authorization, requiring clearer guidelines to understand the process. 6) Clarifications for cross-border operations: Clarification is needed on the point of importers of less than one tonne, and the authorization mechanism should account for com- panies operating across multiple Member States. 7) Simplifications for AEO certified companies: A simplified authorization process should be implemented for AEO-cer- tified companies, potentially exempting them from certain financial and operational capacity requirements. 8) Clarifications of deadlines in the legal text: The deadlines for assessing applications are complex and interconnected, necessitating clarity and guidance on how extensions and additional information requests impact the initial deadlines.\nSagsnr.:\n1 Timing issues with the authorization process\nCurrently, companies subject to CBAM are advised of their re- porting obligation after they have imported CBAM goods. If this remains the case in the definitive period, companies will have no knowledge of the need to be authorized CBAM declarants before their goods arrive at the EU border. Thus, companies will not be able to obtain authorization prior to their import of CBAM-goods, and goods will risk being stranded at the border until companies have been authorized as CBAM declarants, leading to significant delays. This appears to be an issue that must be handled urgently.\nA possible solution to this issue could be the possibility for com- panies to be authorized for import with retroactive effect for first-time importers. Another solution could be to implement a minimum threshold for authorization, where imports under a certain level need not apply for authorization.\n2\nThreshold of one tonne\nFollowing the wording in recital no. 11 as well as the threshold specified in art. 13 regarding the consultation period, it appears that one tonne has been selected as a relevant threshold value. However, it appears unclear what this threshold will indicate and/or be applied towards. It would be beneficial to clarify this, especially since it appears to be quite a low threshold.\n3\ncompliance Given the current challenges of many companies to submit CBAM-reports using real emissions data, we are concerned that companies might lose their authorization as CBAM importers if they are considered to be non-compliant with the regulation, despite their efforts to gather data from suppliers. Most com- panies attempt to be compliant and gather the required data to report under CBAM, but in some cases, suppliers are not able or willing to submit real emissions data, making it difficult for importers to be compliant with the regulation.\nConcerns about\nand authorization\nWhile default values will once again be an option in the defini- tive period from 2026, this will be an added cost for companies importing CBAM goods. This will particularly affect SMEs, who are already struggling with the added administrative costs and burdens of CBAM. Thus, we believe that there should be a tai- lored mechanism to address this issue. This could be similar to the option which exists at the moment, where companies have the option to prove and document in the CBAM registry, that\nthey have taken all measures to gather the necessary infor- mation for reporting.\nAdditionally, the proposal states that in order to obtain author- ization as CBAM declarant, companies must meet the condition of not having been involved in repeated infringement of cus- toms legislation and taxation rules amongst other things. Would it be possible to elaborate how potential non-compliance dur- ing the transitional period of the CBAM implementation will po- tentially — if at all — factor into this decision-making process?\n4 Administrative capacities\nRegarding the conditions for financial and operational capacity in art. 11, the proposal states that companies must prove they have an administrative organization suitable for fulfilling the es- timated obligations, internal controls, etc. As CBAM currently represents a substantial administrative burden, especially for SMEs, it is essential to consider the size of many of the affected companies when determining whether the necessary adminis- trative capacity has been proven when applying for authoriza- tion. This correlates to the point in art. 11.3, which takes the specific amount of imported goods into account.\nThere are companies who import high volumes of CBAM goods but have a limited number of employees. Thus, it is important to clarify what specific criteria will be used by the National Com- petent Authority to determine whether the company has the “administrative organization suitable for the fulfillment of CBAM obligations” (Art. 11.1 (d)).\n5\nRevocation of authorization\nIn art. 9, it is stated that when CBAM authorization is revoked, the CBAM account shall remain under the status of ‘closed’ until the fifth year following the revocation. In art. 21, it states that a declarant whose status of authorized CBAM declarant has been revoked, may reapply for an authorization at any time. The two statements of art. 9 and art. 21 regarding revocation and reapplication seem initially contradictory. It would be beneficial to ensure more clarity towards this process and the intercon- nectedness of the mechanisms of revocation and reapplication.\n6\nClarifications regarding cross-border operations\nRegarding no. 11 in the recital, it is stated that “data received during the transitional period shows that importers importing less than one tonne are not engaging in cross-border activity”.\nThis point is rather unclear, as the fact that companies import goods which are subject to CBAM must inherently entail that the company is indeed engaging in cross-border activity. It would be beneficial to get some clarification on this point.\nIn art. 12, the proposal states that the company must not have applied for or been granted authorization in another Member State. It would be beneficial to get elaboration on this point, especially regarding CBAM-importers with subsidiaries within the EU, as well as the reasoning behind the restriction for com- panies to only import CBAM-goods through one Member State.\n7 Simplifications for AEO certified companies Generally, it should be considered to implement a simplified au- thorization process for companies who already hold AEO status. To this regard, it would for example be beneficial to consider companies with AEO status to be exempted from the demon- strating financial and operational capacity as proposed in art. 11. Another point of simplifications would be to either exempt or reduce AEO companies from the requirement to provide a guarantee as proposed in art. 17.\n8\nClarifications of deadlines in the legal text\nOverall, a number of deadlines for assessing applications are presented in the legal text, particularly in art. 4, 5 and 6. These deadlines appears to be both interconnected and complex, which can potentially lead to confusion and delays in authoriza- tion for companies. There is a lack of clarity regarding the rela- tionship between these deadlines, which should be cleared up in the legal text. Additionally, there is a need for guidance on how both extensions and the request for additional information influence the initial deadlines for application as authorized CBAM declarant."

        "pdf_text": "—€ iia group\nCarbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) — authorising CBAM declarants\nResponse to public consultation by Elia Group:\nAs Transmission System Operator (TSO) for electricity, active in both Belgium and Germany, we would like to elaborate on the particular situation with which TSOs are confronted via the current CBAM regulation:\nWith respect to electricity, we are a regulated entity responsible to built, maintain and operate the high-voltage grid in the interest of society in order to keep the lights on. Therefore we should not be perceived as an energy trader.. We assess that the CBAM declarant obligations for electricity would be a disproportionate measure for the TSO to comply with, especially considering the very limited volumes of electricity concerned. Please find attached the arguments provided bilaterally to the European Commission on 14 November 2024 on behalf of our European association, ENTSO-E. With respect to the other commodity goods in scope of CBAM, we would like to provide you with specific feedback regarding article 11 of the implementing act, subject to public consultation. Article 11 defines the conditions for financial and operational capacity but does not make any linkage with the requirements from the operators already in place. Considering the ambition of the EU Commission to reduce unnecessary administrative burden by 25% for the next legislative term, we do not see why TSOs should have to proof their financial and operational capacity as described in article 11 IA. TSOs already have to provide the proof of their financial capacity etc. according to Art 44 of Directive 2019/944 (Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (recast)). A further simplification is needed to avoid unnecessary administrative burden.\nWe trust the new European Commission would be willing to take above and attached contribution into consideration.\nIn general terms, the given deadline for feedback was quite short while many legal questions remain and could not all be captured in this consultation. Therefore, we would highly appreciate providing further guidance with support from the European Association for TSOs to fully capture the societal role of TSOs, the complexity of the electricity market(s) and the regulatory requirements TSOs need to fulfill.\n-€ elia\ngroup\n1. Role of TSOs and related activities under CBAM\nA) Emergency Assistance Agreements— Background info\nIn the context of their electricity interconnectors with other countries, including third countries, (e.g., the UK), TSOs may need “services” from their counterpart (i.e., the TSO or TSOs in the other country) to address congestion or balancing issues. These services agreements are not contracted with market players, but they are negotiated bilaterally between two TSOs.\nEmergency Assistance (EA) is an emergency mechanism, activated manually by System Operators to secure the electricity networkand with no market impact. EA mechanisms can be activated in various situations:\nESSE\nss\nEES\n1. Role of TSOs and related activities under CBAM\nA) Emergency Assistance Agreements— Background info\nEA volumes are validated at the earliest on H-1, i.e. after the market closes. The Emergency Assistance mechanism is only activated during the TSO's operational window, i.e. during the neutralisation period for players, to give the market as much chance as possible to resolve the problem on its own. Such services are therefore used very close to real time and have an emergency nature and are therefore not intended to be auctioned, but only to react to a factual situation.\nThe availability of assistance deliveries, including from third countries, is not only important for ensuring the safe operation of national electricity systems, but also the EU's interconnected electricity system. Even though the amounts of electricity imported via this mechanism may be negligible compared to the volumes of electricity generated and consumed in the EU, they can prevent blackouts as they are provided in critical places at critical times.\nIn conclusion, EA Mechanism participates in inter-state solidarity in emergency situations where the safety of the electricity system and the public service mission of the TSOs are endangered.\n1. Role of TSOs and related activities under CBAM\nA) Emergency Assistance Agreements— exemption from the CBAM Regulation\nEmergency Assistance Agreements should not fall under the scope of the CBAM Regulation:\n1. (Technical) nominations\nEA does not use nominations in the same way as market players, in this case TSOs make (technical) nominations EA is not carried out via exchanges or market players and is operated directly by the TSO in the control roams. The volume required for the EA is determined directly with the other TSO, after which it is compensated directly The prices of the EA are described in agreements and defined bilaterally This manoeuvre is therefore transparentfor market players (e.g. na interventianon capacity purchases)\n2. No risk of carbon leakage\nAs per Article 1(1), the CBAM Regulation aims to prevent the risk of carbon leakage([3], thereby reducing global carbon emissions The inclusion of electricity trade in CBAM is justified by the fact that generation of electricity produces a significant portion of anthrapogenicearbon dioxide, and there is a risk of carbon leakage However, TSOs are not guided by economic considerations when providing EA, but by system safety circumstances in a first place. Indeed, the price of the EA offers is nat the primary criterion for selecting them, since the availabilityof the EA is weighed first, follawed by the risk of creating congestion with its activation. Exempting EA from the scope of the CBAM regulation would therefore not create a risk of carbon leakage, since TSOs do not base the selection of these offers on purely economic criteria. Furthermore, exempting EA from CBAM would not consist a risk for carbon leakage because EA is activated very sporadicallyand represents only limited use per year, in terms of frequency and volume of MWh.\n3. Definition of “importation”\nAs per Article 2(1), the CBAM Regulation applies to the importation into the customs territory of the Unian of certain goods originating in a third country The definition of “importation” provided by Article 3(4) refers to the “release for free circulation as provided for in Article 201 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013\". Article 201 of the Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 says that “{_) goods intended to be put on the Union market or intended for private use or consumption within the customs territory of the Union shall be placed under release for free circulation”.\nThis means that importation under the CBAM shall concern electricity intended to be put on the market or for private use or consumption In the case of EA agreements, the exchange of electricity is not intendedto be put on the market, but above all serves to ensure the security of the electricity system in the EU.\n4. Complex administrative process\nThe complex administrative process for CBAM clearing, especially the necessity to secure specific volumes of CBAM certificates in advance, is not feasible for urgent electricity exchanges It is because their precise timing and volumes is known only very shortly in advance. If transmission system operators’ assistance is not exempted fram CBAM, it will most probablybe preventedin practice, as the process will pose too much regulatory risk for the engaged parties. Leaving CBAM unchanged in this regai a lea increase the risk of blackouts in the interconnectedelectricity systems.\n-& elia\ngroup\n1. Role of TSOs and related activities under CBAM\nB) Intended/unintended exchanges of energy under SAFA- Background\ninfo\nContinental Europe Synchronous Area Framework Agreement (SAFA)\nThe scope of SAFA is to provide a legal framework for the operation of the interconnected grids by the TSOs of the Synchronous Area of Continental Europe[4] through compliance with the methodologies, conditions and values adopted in line with Article 6 of the System Operation Guideline (SO GL) and the Network Code on Electricity Emergency and Restoration (NC ER).\nAlso, the SAFA provides a legal framework for the settlement rules for the intended and unintended exchange of energy pursuant to Article 50(3) and Article 51(1) of Electricity Balancing Guideline (EB GL).\nDue to the due to the physical nature of an interconnected network, there are unavoidably deviations between the intended/planned exchange and the actual physical flow. These deviations, which are indeed determined as the difference between the physical changes and the scheduled changes, are referred to as unintended exchange.\nThere are three different components of these deviations:\nFeu ncy CONLaINMeEnt Droce’s nerey EY)\nresults from the activation of FCR across the synchronous area and it is an intended component results from the application of ramps to the scheduled exchanges and it is also an intended component\n\nthird component, corresponding to the residual amount\nis the actual unintended exchange\neo ——_—\n1. Role of TSOs and related activities under CBAM\nB) Intended/unintended exchanges of energy under SAFA— exemption from the CBAM Regulation\nIntended/unintended exchanges under SAFA should not fall under the scope of the CBAM Regulation:\n1. Unintended and unplanned exchange\nRegarding the third component of deviations between the intended/planned exchange and the actual physical flow in the interconnected network, this component is a residual amount, which comes from unintended and unplanned exchange. This specific component should be excluded from the scope of the CBAM Regulation since it is subject to the laws of physics rather than legal regulations.\n2. No risk of carbon leakage\nThe argument already provided for the EA agreements is as well valid in the case of the exchange of energy under the SAFA\n3. Definition of “importation”\nThe argument already provided for the EA agreements is as well valid in the case of the exchange of energy under the SAFA. In particular, inthe case of exchanges under SAFA, these are energy flows that no one has the intention to obtain as such, but simply happen as result of traffic in the Continental Europe Synchronous Area.\n4. Complex administrative process\nThe argument already provided for the EA agreements is as well valid in the case of the exchange of energy under the SAFA\n—€ iia group\nAbout Elia Group\nOne of Europe’s top five TSOs\nElia Group is a key player in electricity transmission.

        "pdf_text": "There is in a significant risk for the CBAM effectiveness, if CBAM declarants are not sufficiently screened and controlled, and are allowed to make imports of CBAM goods for extended periods of time with emissions declarations that are lower than default values but without having received solid data from the manufacturers.\nIn effect, in most cases the CBAM declarant will not have access to the data, or have the skills necessary to determine on their own whether actual emissions were calculated accurately. The only way for CBAM declarants to have any chance to be right about emissions lower than default value is if they receive emission data that comes from foreign manufacturers that have registered on the CBAM registry, and submitted third-party verified report.\nIn accordance with Article 10 of the CBAM Regulation, installation operators in third countries can apply for registration, upload installation data, and submit emissions data via the CBAM Registry, which will open in January 2025. Operators in third countries who register and provide verified emission data via the CBAM Registry are likely to be more trustworthy in terms of quality of emission data since they are confident enough to share the information directly with the Commission.\nThere is currently no obligation, no incentive even, under the CBAM Regulation for EU importers to make best efforts to import CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry. Thus, the draft Implementing Regulation does not directly include any wording on this.\nAt the same time, we note that the draft IR provides in recital (10) that “to ensure that only bona fide importers become authorised CBAM declarants, the competent authorities should make sure that the applicant has not been involved in a serious or repeated infringement of legislation including economic criminal offences, and that it has a good financial rating” and provides detailed rules on criteria for granting the status of authorized CBAM declarant in Article 10 (serious or repeated infringements) and Article 11 (conditions for financial and operational capacity).\nEUROFER suggests the to amend Article 11.1(e), as indicated in yellow below.\nIn addition, when the competent authority determines the revocation of the status of authorized CBAM declarants in accordance with Article 23 of the draft Implementing Regulation, the competent authority could consider the fact that that the authorized CBAM declarants made use of third country operators registered in the CBAM Registry as an indication of good faith to comply with CBAM obligations.\n**\nArticle 11.1 of the draft IR provides as follows:\nThe criteria laid down in Article 17(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 shall be fulfilled where the following conditions are met:\n(a) the applicant is not subject to bankruptcy proceedings;\n(b) the applicant is not in arrears with the payment of customs duties, taxes or charges which are collected on or in connection with the import of goods, financial regulatory obligations and all other duties related to its economic activity;\nSensitivity: general\n(c) the applicant demonstrates, on the basis of supporting documents provided together with the application, a sufficient financial standing to meet its obligations and fulfil commitments having regard to the type and volume of the economic activity performed by indicating the financial figures and any other financial information;\n(d) the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for fulfilment of the estimated obligations to surrender CBAM certificates, and has internal controls capable of preventing, detecting and correcting errors in CBAM declarations and CBAM certificates management, and of preventing and detecting illegal or any irregular transactions.\n\nSensitivity: general"

A more feasible approach could include the following pillars: - For companies holding the status of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO), the application process to become a CBAM declarant should be significantly streamlined and simplified. This would considerably reduce the administrative burden for both enterprises and authorities and facilitate the overall implementation of CBAM. - Instead of introducing additional minimum threshold levels (as proposed by other respondents, e.g., based on import weights) for the declarant status, a swift adjustment of the overall CBAM De-Minimis is inevitable for the effectiveness and feasibility of the overall scheme.

We offer the following recommendations to support a harmonised and efficient implementation across the EU:\nAuthorisation Process\nShortened Timelines: We recommend significantly reducing the timelines for granting applications. Uniform deadlines for processing applications, including extensions, should be established for all Member States, e.g., 15 + 15 days, in line with Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nTo support a more efficient authorisation process, we propose the following trade facilitation measures:\ne Automatic Approval for Trusted Operators: Automatically grant CBAM declarant status to businesses holding trusted trader certifications (e.g., AEO status) and/or with proven compliance records during the transitional period. Exemption for Low-Volume Importers: Exempt importers with very low volumes (e.g., under 1 ton of emissions per year) or import values below a defined financial threshold. Document-Based Checklist: Implement a pre-set documentary checklist to allow for fast or automated approval for applicants meeting eligibility criteria. Provisional Authorisation: For complex cases, grant provisional authorisation valid for six months, allowing imports while completing the full authorisation/consultation process. Simplified Renewal Process: Enable automatic renewal based on self-certification for existing CBAM declarants with strong compliance records, removing the need for a full re-application.\nFurther Recommendations for Trade Facilitation and SME Support\ne Flat Rate Guarantee Option for SMEs: Instead of calculating guarantees based on estimated imports, provide a flat rate guarantee option for low-volume importers and SMEs, subject to periodic review.\nFurther clarification is required on the following issues:\ne Application process and authorisation coverage for intermediaries, e.g. indirect customs representatives acting as CBAM declarants with several clients in multiple Member States. Calculation of the €500,000 threshold for such intermediaries (Article 11(4) of the proposal). Article 10 on serious or repeated infringements: A more detailed definition of the terminology used in this article is requested to ensure harmonised implementation across Member States. For example, clarification is needed on the practical meaning of terms such as \"administrative and judiciary proceedings\" and \"serious infringements.\"\nWe thank the European Commission for the opportunity to contribute to this public consultation and remain at its disposal for any further clarification or assistance."

Clarification of consultation deadlines: The draft makes several references to different deadlines (e.g. 15, 45 or 120 days). A clear and uniform definition of deadlines for consultation procedures and processing of applications is essential to avoid confusion. 2. Transparent requirements for applicants: The requirements, in particular on the requirement to demonstrate financial and operational capacity (Article 17(2)), should be complemented by clear guidelines. It is important to specify which documents are accepted as evidence (e.g. audited financial reports, internal control systems) and how to assess them. 3. Procedures for smaller companies: The approach of alleviating unnecessary administrative burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is strongly welcomed. However, the criteria and procedures for taking into account specific business characteristics could be further clarified. 4. Ensuring data consistency in the CBAM registry: A key challenge will be the integration and monitoring of data in the CBAM registry. It should be ensured that notifiers can easily update their data without having to go through new application procedures, unless the changes are substantial. 5. Support for affected businesses: Many companies face difficulties in obtaining data along the supply chain. Standardised templates or tools could help to efficiently meet the data requirements. 6.

        "pdf_text": "(ence)\nIKEA comments on the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - authorising CBAM declarants\nIKEA welcomes a well-designed pragmatic legislation to prevent carbon leakage, clearly defining obligations companies are realistically able to fulfil. This will ensure companies are progressing toward their climate targets and are able to maintain their competitive position on the domestic and international markets, while non-EU producers are incentivised to reduce their emissions.\nSustainability is deeply rooted in our vision to create a better everyday life for the many people, and we support the European Green Deal initiative to combat climate change and the efforts to make the European Union climate neutral by 2050. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is an important, pragmatic, and necessary step in promoting global efforts to combat global warming.\nWith this in mind, we want to share our experience based views regarding implementing regulation of CBAM, with focus on the conditions and procedures related to the status of authorised CBAM declarants. For multinational businesses like IKEA, reducing administrative burden are important to ensure more effective and efficient implementation of the legislation.\nThe procedures and conditions authorising CBAM declarants have a direct impact on internal processes and resources in companies and corresponding competent authorities. IKEA operates a full value chain in 63 markets, resulting in substantial administrative burdens for various reporting requirements. In our experience gained through the operation of global goods flows, we would like to share the following insights for the European Commission to consider during the development of processes and tools aimed at authorizing CBAM declarants:\nCentralization of reporting As a global retailer, we will be reporting in many European markets. One key action that can greatly reduce the administrative burden is to establish one common declaration tool enabling a log on to a single account, where multiple country reports can be filed. Central purchasing of CBAM certificates from 2026 is also needed to mitigate the potential complexity of having to purchase separate certificates in each reporting country. Centralisation on the end of the reporting rather than the company will establish a much more efficient process for companies and the competent authorities.\nApplication processing timeline Since a new reporting portal will be established for competent authorities to receive and process all applications, a one year timeline is likely to prove challenging. We anticipate an application handling process to take in excess of 135 days (15+120+ x additional handling days as stated in the draft implementing regulation). It will take time for both the companies and competent authorities to become familiar with and efficient in the use of the new reporting portal. The processing time itself is lengthy. The National Competent Authorities will receive a\nInter IKEA Group November 27, 2024\nInternal\nmassive inflow of applications within 2025. This poses a significant risk to authorisations not being issued until after January 2026.\nSimplified application for AOEs A simplified application procedure would enable a more efficient and accelerated process for Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs) who are an already trusted trader. By applying the mutual recognition principle, verification processes can be simplified, eliminating complex applications.\nSubmission in the applicant's country of main operation Easing the administrative burden for multinational companies and opening for the possibility for the Economic Operator (EOs) to submit applications to the Competent authorities in the country with main accounts of the EOs or at least part of the activities covered by the decision are to be carried out as per UCC, Article 22 (1), 3\" subparagraph is a preferred solution. Already today, this is effective for Binding Tariff Information (BTI).\nClear rules for non-EU resident importers More information and clarification is needed for importers not established in a Member State who wish to become authorised CBAM declarants and what is the possibility for those to represent another EO. Today, the draft implementing act, Article 1(3), states that: \"Where the applicant is a legal person established in a third country and is in one of the situations referred to in Article 5, point (31)(b), of Regulation (EU) 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council4 , the applicant shall provide its address in that third county and its address of establishment in the Member State where the application is submitted.\" But this does not provide information of the purpose of giving that information, nor if a non-EU resident company can become an authorised CBAM declarant.\nUnder the CBAM legislation the declarant is responsible for reporting, forecasting of emissions and future acquisition of certificates and carbon offsets. The declarant is currently defined as only residents of the EU. However, not all importers into the EU are residents of the EU and companies in countries such as Norway, Switzerland or UK would have to set up permanent establishment in the EU, or ask their multiple services providers to take on the risk of legal liability on the companies’ behalf, which would add even more administrative, financial and resources burdens. As the legislation already provides for carbon offset allowances for countries such as Norway and Switzerland, as a minimum, we ask the Commission to consider these non-EU resident importers of countries within the Schengen or EFTA areas as declarants for CBAM purposes, and as such, included in the definition of a declarant.\nFor further information, please contact:\nInter IKEA Group\nKeika Lee\nkeika.lee@inter.ikea.com\nAbout IKEA\nIKEA offers well-designed, functional, and affordable, high-quality home furnishing, produced with care for people and the environment.

        "pdf_text": "There is in a significant risk for the CBAM effectiveness, if CBAM declarants are not sufficiently screened and controlled, and are allowed to make imports of CBAM goods for extended periods of time with emissions declarations that are lower than default values but without having received solid data from the manufacturers.\nIn effect, in most cases the CBAM declarant will not have access to the data, or have the skills necessary to determine on their own whether actual emissions were calculated accurately. The only way for CBAM declarants to have any chance to be right about emissions lower than default value is if they receive emission data that comes from foreign manufacturers that have registered on the CBAM registry, and submitted third-party verified report.\nIn accordance with Article 10 of the CBAM Regulation, installation operators in third countries can apply for registration, upload installation data, and submit emissions data via the CBAM Registry, which will open in January 2025. Operators in third countries who register and provide verified emission data via the CBAM Registry are likely to be more trustworthy in terms of quality of emission data since they are confident enough to share the information directly with the Commission.\nThere is currently no obligation, no incentive even, under the CBAM Regulation for EU importers to make best efforts to import CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry. Thus, the draft Implementing Regulation does not directly include any wording on this.\nAt the same time, we note that the draft IR provides in recital (10) that “to ensure that only bona fide importers become authorised CBAM declarants, the competent authorities should make sure that the applicant has not been involved in a serious or repeated infringement of legislation including economic criminal offences, and that it has a good financial rating” and provides detailed rules on criteria for granting the status of authorized CBAM declarant in Article 10 (serious or repeated infringements) and Article 11 (conditions for financial and operational capacity).\nEUROFER suggests the to amend Article 11.1(e), as indicated below.\nIn addition, when the competent authority determines the revocation of the status of authorized CBAM declarants in accordance with Article 23 of the draft Implementing Regulation, the competent authority could consider the fact that that the authorized CBAM declarants made use of third country operators registered in the CBAM Registry as an indication of good faith to comply with CBAM obligations.\n**\nArticle 11.1 of the draft IR provides as follows:\nThe criteria laid down in Article 17(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 shall be fulfilled where the following conditions are met:\n(a) the applicant is not subject to bankruptcy proceedings;\n(b) the applicant is not in arrears with the payment of customs duties, taxes or charges which are collected on or in connection with the import of goods, financial regulatory obligations and all other duties related to its economic activity;\n(c) the applicant demonstrates, on the basis of supporting documents provided together with the application, a sufficient financial standing to meet its obligations and fulfil commitments having regard to the type and volume of the economic activity performed by indicating the financial figures and any other financial information;\n(d) the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for fulfilment of the estimated obligations to surrender CBAM certificates, and has internal controls capable of preventing, detecting and correcting errors in CBAM declarations and CBAM certificates management, and of preventing and detecting illegal or any irregular transactions."

        "pdf_text": "27 November 2024, Brussels\nBaker Hughes’ response to the European Commission’s consultation on the implementing regulations as regards the conditions and procedures related to the status of authorised CBAM declarant and the CBAM registry.\nIntroduction\nBaker Hughes is a leading energy technology company that provides solutions for energy and industrial customers worldwide. We design, manufacture, and service transformative technologies to help take energy forward —- making it safer, cleaner, and more efficient for the people and the planet. While we operate globally, Europe is a key market and corporate home for Baker Hughes. Across the EU, Norway and the UK, Baker Hughes employs approximately 17,000 people in engineering, manufacturing, and research and development roles.\nBaker Hughes supports the Paris Agreement objectives and the energy and climate goals set out by the European Union. We believe that climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing the world and warrants meaningful action to reduce the environmental impact. In this context, we see the greatest potential in hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) and technologies aimed at emissions abatement. Many of our products (e.g., turbines, compressors, valves, pumps, drilling equipment) are manufactured across the European Economic Area (EEA) and exported globally, contributing positively to the trade balance in a number of Member States. Our products and services are provided to thousands of customers across countries in the EEA in a wide range of industrial sectors and generate billions in revenues'. To develop our products in the EU, we rely on global supply chains purchasing materials and various elements from around the world.\nHaving gained valuable insights during the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) reporting cycle, we would like to share our observations and recommendations in relation to the\nBaker Hughes $3\n' Baker Hughes 10-K Report submitted in February 2024, available here.\nPAGE |1\nBaker Hughes $3\nupcoming supplementary CBAM legislation. Additionally, we have provided comments on the future legislative steps regarding the requirements and the expansion of the EU CBAM.\nRecommendation: Clarify requirements related to guarantees.\nChapter Il of the draft Regulation outlines the conditions and procedures related to the status of an authorised CBAM declarant, including the requirement to register a guarantee in the CBAM registry. This guarantee is intended to cover the number of CBAM certificates that the declarant will be required to purchase in order to cover the carbon emissions embedded in imported goods. According to the draft Regulation, the amount of the guarantee will be determined by the competent authorities and is intended to ensure that companies have sufficient financial capacity to meet their CBAM obligations.\nWhile the draft Regulation provides detailed provisions on registering and adjusting guarantees, there remains an important question regarding whether companies are required to establish new guarantees specifically for CBAM or if existing guarantees (e.g., bank guarantees already in place for VAT or customs) can be used to meet these new obligations. At present, many companies already have bank guarantees which are common requirements in international trade. Given the similarities in financial guarantees for VAT and customs obligations, there is a question as to whether these existing guarantees can be used to satisfy the new CBAM requirements, or if companies will be expected to open entirely new guarantees.\nIn light of the above considerations, we recommend that the European Commission clarifies\nwhether companies are required to establish new bank guarantees solely for CBAM compliance or if existing guarantees (e.g., for VAT or customs) can be adjusted or repurposed to meet CBAM requirements.\nRecommendation: Ensure smooth submission of data via the CBAM registry.\nAs a truly European company with numerous legal entities across various EU countries, we are currently required to manage a separate Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) for each of our entities that need to comply with the CBAM requirements. This necessitates\nPAGE | 2\nBaker Hughes $3\nthe appointment of a declarant with access to the CBAM transitional registry for each legal entity, meaning we need around 30 trained staff members to ensure compliance with CBAM requirements across our operations.\nAt present, this situation is resource- and time-intensive, placing a significant administrative burden on our teams. To streamline this process and improve operational efficiency, we\nrecommend introducing the option to allocate multiple EORIs to one declarant within the permanent CBAM registry.\nBy centralizing the process and appointing fewer declarants, we believe companies could simplify internal workflows, enhance the effectiveness of data collection, and ensure stronger governance to comply with the CBAM requirements. This approach would ultimately reduce the administrative load while maintaining the integrity of the regulatory framework.\nRecommendations for the future developments of the CBAM requirements.\n1 Allow using a set of default values if actual data is not available.\nHaving gained insights through the CBAM reporting cycles, we have identified a critical challenge in its implementation: the lack of actual data on embedded emissions which we are currently working to gather from our suppliers. This requirement is based on the assumption that carbon footprint data is available for every item, article, and/or product that is produced, manufactured, and/or assembled. However, this is simply not the case as we are very early in the process of tracking and accounting for every single item that is placed in the stream of commerce. Because we are early in the journey of carbon tracking and accounting at the article and product level, many suppliers lack the technical expertise in carbon accounting, and it is not feasible to build expertise in 12 months. This means that companies like ours face delays as we rely on data\nfrom hundreds of suppliers. In light of these challenges, we recommend allowing the use of\ndefault values if actual data is not available as this would enable smoother implementation while data tracking capabilities mature.\nPAGE | 3\nBaker Hughes $3\n2. Assess competitiveness before expanding the scope of the CBAM Regulation.\nBefore expanding the scope of the CBAM Regulation by including sectors exposed to carbon leakage, the European Commission must conduct a thorough competitiveness assessment. This assessment should include:\ne A dialogue with affected industries that would lose free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System; Impact on buyers of affected goods - this includes evaluating costs stemming from the reporting requirements and purchasing of the CBAM certificates; Review of already included goods, such as CN 7318, which covers screws, bolts, and nuts. These goods usually have low value, while the administrative burden and financial impact of managing CBAM reporting often exceed the value of the goods themselves and the potential cost of certificates.\nIntroduce verification thresholds and phase-in period to minimize risks with the\nimplementation.\nThe verification processes for embedded emissions are expected to impose significant financial and administrative burdens on companies. In some cases, the costs of verification may exceed the value of the CBAM certificates that must be purchased when importing goods that are on the\nCBAM list. To address this, we recommend the introduction of thresholds for when verification\nis required, ensuring that only imports above a certain volume or value would be required to have emissions verified. This would ensure that the process remains manageable for companies importing smaller volumes. Furthermore, supplementary laws on verification process and accreditation of verifiers are not expected to be published before mid-2025 — this short timeline creates many challenges for companies to comply with the CBAM requirements. Firstly, internal processes will not be developed on time. Secondly, we will have a shortage of trained verifiers. For these reasons, the European Commission should consider accelerating the\ndevelopment of secondary legislation and training programmes for verifiers. Additionally, the Commission should introduce a phased approach to implementing verification requirements.\nThis would provide time for businesses to develop internal processes and for the market to build\ncapacity in terms of trained verifiers and assurance providers.\nPAGE | 4\nBaker Hughes $3\nConclusions\nThe introduction of the CBAM intends to ensure a level playing field for European businesses.\nHowever, the existing CBAM requirements create administrative burden for companies as\nhighlighted by the Draghi report. For this reason, it is important that the CBAM supplementary\nlaws will provide additional guidance to facilitate smooth governance in companies.\nBaker Hughes appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to the draft Regulations and would be pleased to discuss should you have any questions.\nAbout Baker Hughes:\nBaker Hughes is an energy technology company that provides solutions to energy and industrial customers worldwide.

Detailed comment in German:\nWir danken für die Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme zu dieser für die Unternehmen wichtigen Verord- nung.\nC. Das Wichtigste in Kürze\n2026 startet der Echtbetrieb für CBAM. EU-Importeure müssen sich bei den in den jeweiligen EU- Mitgliedstaaten zuständigen nationalen Behörden registrieren, um den Status eines zugelassenen CBAM-Anmelders zu erhalten. Ohne diesen Status können EU-Importeure ab 2026 keine CBAM-Waren mehr importieren. Es ist vorgesehen, dass der CBAM-Anmelder zahlreiche Kriterien hinsichtlich seiner Zuverlässigkeit erfüllen muss. Der Prozess ist komplex. Zusätzlich muss der EU-Importeur ab 2026 am Zertifikatehandel für Emissionszertifikate teilnehmen. Mit diesen Vorgaben soll sichergestellt werden, dass eine präzise Abrechnung des CO;-Grenzausgleichs möglich ist.\nBetroffene Unternehmen wünschen sich eine praxistaugliche Regelung, die klar und einfach formuliert ist. Sie sollte auch die Situation von KMUs und Einführern mit wenigen Importen berücksichtigen. An- sonsten könnte CBAM dazu führen, dass kleine Unternehmen aus dem Markt ausscheiden, da das Ver- fahren zu bürokratisch und unübersichtlich ist - vor allem unter der Annahme, dass es (gerade Klein-) Unternehmen geben wird, die kurzfristig und nur einmalig Kleinsendungen, wie Spezialschrauben als Ersatzteile, importieren müssen, ohne den Status als CBAM-Anmelder zu besitzen und diesen auch nicht weiterverwenden werden. Für diese Fälle sollte ein vereinfachtes Verfahren möglich sein: die Ein- fuhr mit Zahlung nach Standardwerten. Dadurch wird Fit for 55 nicht gefährdet.\nImporteure mit wenigen Importen sollten grundsätzlich zwischen Echtwerten und Standardwerten wählen können. Für Importeure mit wenigen Importsendungen verursacht die Registrierung (und die Beteiligung am Zertifikatehandel einschließlich Abrechnung) einen unverhältnismäßigen Aufwand. Wenn man diese Unternehmen nicht aus dem Import verdrängen möchte, muss die Zulassung radikal vereinfacht werden. Dies wäre möglich, indem Unternehmen mit wenigen Sendungen keine Registrie- rung brauchen, sondern beim Import den Grenzausgleich bei der Verzollung bezahlen - in Höhe der dann ermittelten neuen Standardwerte. Bestenfalls bestünde eine Wahlmöglichkeit der Unternehmen, welchen Weg sie wählen möchten.\nDie Einführung des CBAM-Systems ab 2026 erfordert eine sorgfältige Vorbereitung. Obwohl der Zeit- raum von Januar bis Dezember 2025 auf den ersten Blick ausreichend erscheint, könnte die Zeit knapp werden. Die DIHK plädiert dafür, dass die EU-Kommission die Zulassungsverfahren in den Mitgliedstaa- ten eng begleitet und steuernd eingreift, wenn diese Verfahren ohne verlässliches Ergebnis für die Un- ternehmen verlaufen. Eine vorläufige Zulassung sollte im nächsten Jahr für 2026, für Authorised Econo- mic Operators (AEOs) und für Importeure mit kurzfristigem Importbedarf möglich sein.\nVertretung der DIHK | Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammer bei der EU\n19 A-D, Avenue des Arts | B-1000 Bruxelles\nTel. +32 2 286-1611 | Fax +32 2 286-1605 | Internet: www.dihk.de\n-2-\nD. Bewertung im Einzelnen\nDie Regelung legt das Verfahren und die Bedingungen für die Zulassung von CBAM-Anmeldern fest und soll ab dem 31. Dezember 2024 in Kraft treten. Sie regelt:\n1) die Kommunikation zwischen Antragsteller, Behörde und Kommission, 2) das Antragsformat und dessen Einreichung über das CBAM-Register, 3) die Verfahren und Fristen der Behörde, die die Anträge bearbeitet, 4) Vorschriften für die Behörde, die zugelassene CBAM-Anmelder für die Einfuhr von elektri- schem Strom identifiziert.\nWir nehmen im Folgenden zu den einzelnen Abschnitten der Verordnung Stellung, soweit wir dazu von unserer Mitgliedschaft Rückmeldungen erhalten haben.\n1) Kommunikation zwischen Antragsteller, Behörde und Kommission\n- keine Anmerkungen -\n2) Das Antragsformat und dessen Einreichung über das CBAM-Register - Article 1: Procedures for application\nDas Zulassungsverfahren ist grundsätzlich zu aufwendig, zeitintensiv und bindet zu viele Personalres- sourcen. Es sollte vereinfacht und dadurch praxistauglicher gestaltet werden.\nImporteure mit wenigen Importen sollten zwischen Echtwerten und Standardwerten wählen können\nLetztlich ist die einzige Aufgabe von CBAM sicherzustellen, dass inländische und ausländische Produkte gleich mit CO,-Abgaben belastet werden. Ziel muss daher die einfache und sichere Erhebung des Grenzausgleichs sein.\nDie Regelung zur Zulassung für Anmelder sieht vor, dass jede Einfuhr durch einen autorisierten Anmel- der durchgeführt wird. Diese Anforderung ist angesichts der Häufigkeit von eingeführten Kleinmengen, wie zum Beispiel bei Spezialschrauben als Ersatzteile, unangemessen. Sie überfordert Unternehmen mit wenigen bzw. kleinen Sendungen, die gerade die Bagatellgrenzen überschreiten.\nDass auch Unternehmen mit wenigen bzw. kleinen Sendungen CBAM-gerecht importieren können, lässt sich praktisch am besten umsetzen, indem die CBAM-Abgabe beim jeweiligen Import durch den Zoll miterhoben wird.\nAlle relevanten Daten sind bereits in der Zollanmeldung enthalten (Warennummer, Nettogewicht, Ur- sprung). Das Nettogewicht der Ware könnte mit den für 2026 neu berechneten Standardwerten multi- pliziert und im Abgabenbescheid ausgewiesen bzw. eingezogen werden. Registrierung und Teilnahme am Emissionshandel sind dann nicht erforderlich. Falls ein Unternehmen eine exakte Abrechnung\nVertretung der DIHK | Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammer bei der EU\n19 A-D, Avenue des Arts | B-1000 Bruxelles\nTel. +32 2 286-1611 | Fax +32 2 286-1605 | Internet: www.dihk.de\n-3-\nanstelle der höheren Standardwerte möchte, steht die Zertifizierung und der Emissionshandel als Alter- native offen.\nAlle Unternehmen sollten zwischen den beiden Berechnungsmethoden wählen können, eine Zuord- nung nach Unternehmensgröße ist nur eingeschränkt hilfreich. Maßgeblich muss hingegen die Import- menge und -häufigkeit sein.\nAEOs sollten als Anmelder in einem vereinfachten Verfahren oder automatisch zugelassen werden\nAuch das Verfahren selbst ist kaum praxistauglich, da bereits vorhandene Informationen über Import- eure nicht genutzt werden. Es wäre naheliegend und entlastend zu berücksichtigen, dass ein Anmelder bereits als zugelassener Wirtschaftsbeteiligter (AEO) oder in einer anderen autorisierten Funktion, wie dem zugelassenen Empfänger, tätig ist und bereits Sicherheiten hinterlegt hat. In der EU gibt es rund 20.000 AEOs, die auf diese Weise auf Antrag sofort in den Status des zugelassenen Anmelders versetzt werden könnten.

        "pdf_text": "—\nEF\\ EUROPEAN\nSubject: Input on the consultation on CBAM — authorising CBAM declarants\nThe European Express Association (EEA) is pleased to submit its feedback on the consultation regarding authorising CBAM declarants:\nTimelines for assessing the CBAM application.\ne The proposed assessment periods outlined in Articles 4(1) and 5 of the draft implementing Regulation—120 days for reviewing applications submitted by EU-based importers, extendable to 180 days when additional information is required—are considered by EEA excessively lengthy. Such prolonged timelines risk delaying the timely authorization of CBAM declarants and could impose unnecessary barriers to the import of CBAM goods. The EEA shares this concern and urges the Commission to reconsider these deadlines to ensure a more efficient and streamlined process, facilitating smoother compliance, and avoiding undue disruptions to trade.\nBAM D larant — ibl incr f rrent threshol for th fini ri ?\ne For the last three years, the EEA has proposed to the EU Commission the introduction of a minimum threshold for the most critical flows such as small consignments and B2C traffic based on combined criteria relating to weight, value or volume of the actual importer of CBAM goods. At present, the only de minimis provision in the CBAM regulation is a value threshold set at €150. Unfortunately, the current de minimis provision does not exempt smaller, higher-value consignments (such as those typically carried by express parcels operators) or higher-value consignments with very small CO2 footprints. In order to address this issue, EEA would like to take this opportunity to once again highlight the need to revisit the current threshold.\nChallenges with Forecasting Import Values and Providing Customer Information\ne Article 11 of the draft implementing Regulation further elaborates on the criteria established in Article 17(2)(b) of the CBAM Main Regulation. In particular, paragraph 3 indicates that competent authorities shall take into account the specific characteristics of the applicant, including the information on the estimated volume of imports. Under CBAM Main regulation it is required that declarants provide detailed forecasts, including: the estimated monetary value and volume of imports by type of goods for the calendar year during which the application is submitted, as well as for the following calendar year. As well as the names and contact information of the persons on behalf of whom the applicant is acting, if applicable. While these requirements aim to enhance transparency, they pose significant challenges for indirect customs representatives, such as economic operators offering logistics services, who depend on their customers for this data. The availability and accuracy of such information can fluctuate over time, making precise forecasting difficult. Given these challenges, we urge the Commission to reconsider the feasibility of these requirements or provide additional flexibility for indirect customs representatives, acknowledging the practical limitations of gathering and forecasting such data.\nThe European Express Association - Boulevard du Régent 35, 1000 Brussels, T.

        "feedback": "TLF Overseas is the representative federation of French registered customs representatives. As such, our members will potentially have to submit their applications for applications to become “authorised CBAM declarant” in 2025. In view of the deadline of 1 January 2026, from which it is essential to be an ‘authorised CBAM declarant’ in order to import the products concerned, we have been surprised by the deadline for examining the application for authorisation, which seems to us to be very long (up to 150 or even 180 days). Would it be possible to put in place an accelerated authorisation procedure for operators who have already submitted full reports to the Court in 2024? Registered customs representatives, having largely been granted the status of “Authorised Economic Operator”, already have a high level of compliance with the criteria of absence of customs infringements and financial stability. Can a simplified procedure be put in place for those traders already enjoying trusted trader status, identified by their EORI number, in order to reduce the time taken to obtain the authorisation of ‘authorised declarant’? For large importers, we understand and support the need for an additional audit, but believe that the envisaged criterion of EUR 500 000 in value of CBAM certificates lacks objectivity as the value of CBAM certificates will vary according to the ETS market price. A criterion in tonnes of CO2 equivalent thus seems to us to be more objective and secure for businesses, as it is stable regardless of developments in the ETS market. Conversely, for operators importing small volumes, we consider it appropriate to relax the criteria for obtaining the status of ‘CBAM declarant’ so that they can maintain their activity on 1 January 2026. In view of the number of companies that have not submitted a report, we consider it essential to make access to the status of ‘authorised CBAM declarant’ less burdensome in order to facilitate compliance by operators and to increase the number of ‘authorised CBAM declarant’. We would like to thank the European Commission for the opportunity to contribute to this public consultation and remain at its disposal for any useful clarification.",

Fenex fully supports the feedback submitted by CLECAT and the proposals put forward therein regarding trade facilitation and SME support. Fenex would like to emphasise that in the Draft Implementing Regulation no distinction is made between importers and indirect customs representatives. This leads to uncertainty for instance for indirect customs representatives who represent several importers. Will they have to apply for authorisation for every importer separately and how does authorisation work if the customs representative operates in several Member States? Furthermore, in the Draft Implementing Regulation no account is taken of trusted traders i.e. with AEO-status. Trusted traders are recognised as secure and safe business partners who work in close cooperation with customs authorities. Trusted traders should be able to benefit from a smooth authorisation process, to ensure that importers inside and outside of the EU - and SMEs can benefit from indirect customs representation to import CBAM-goods. There is much overlap in the conditions and procedures related to AEO-status and the status of authorised CBAM declarant. Fenex is strongly in favour of automatic approval or simplified procedures for trusted traders to become authorised CBAM declarants.",

        "feedback": "Dear all, although this is maybe not precisely the gist of this feedback I must urge a question about uncertainties and very poor communication between Commission and declarants. The approach of Commission to CBAM in my opinion is a bit unprofessional and thoughtless. A insufficient amount of data has been provided, methodology has been awaited and obligations of payment are just around the corner. We in Croatia, and other EU bordering country have a lot of problems in understanding CBAM implementation for electricity (in my company case) and we do not have any feedback from Customs or EU in regards to that. Imposition of CBAM tax for which I can find understanding combined with energy market that is not developed fully and that is greatly divided from rest of the Europa thanks to very limited cross border capacity will result in great price deviations and potentially very expensive electrical energy. Beside that it is very likely that it will kill the electrical market in the East. Knowing that this is process that is beyond stopping please take all this factor into account and provide us sufficient date and time to prepare. I sincerely urge Commission to communicate in regards with CBAM more openly and to start providing all necessary data as soon as possible. We need one year of good testing of our declarations to see if the whole thing works. As mentioned, uncertainties, are great and we don not know who to address our questions. Expansion to this ambiguities create problems for our everyday operation. In regards to declaration of CBAM I strongly believe that more opened and explained approach is necessary. Workshops have to organized, official EU commission web page is very poor and does not provide enough data. Legislation and interpretation of CBAM could be widely wrongly interpreted because of this lack of information. A test register should be provided in order that we can check and learn about application of CBAM. Also electrical energy is terribly explained and we can not determine basic facts of what agreements (imports) have to be reported (do we have to have PPA for CBAM exclusion, how transit through non EU country should be reported, what about plain electrical trade transactions, etc.) CBAM is a huge monetary change for trade in all economical aspects. Please provide us sufficient information with practical explanations. And be aware that some countries are more exposed to this legislation than others and that is for them it is of crucial interest to prepare in time. A year period, before taxation will past swiftly and we do not have time to loose in the abyss of misinterpretation and poor communication. Thank you",

The fulfilment of AEO obligations already exceeds the requirements of the CBAM declarant. Therefore, we should be able to act as an AEO as CBAM declarant without further application for authorisation. This would save us and the Authority time and effort and avoid additional bureaucracy. At the same time, it would make the status of the AEO more attractive and in the future contribute to the Trust &amp; Check Operators as part of the planned customs reform. It should also be clarified as a matter of urgency what immediate dependencies will exist between CBAM authorisation and customs status in the future.",

        "feedback": "There is in a significant risk for the CBAM effectiveness, if CBAM declarants are not sufficiently screened and controlled, and are allowed to make imports of CBAM goods for extended periods of time with emissions declarations that are lower than default values but without having received solid data from the manufacturers. In effect, in most cases the CBAM declarant will not have access to the data, or have the skills necessary to determine on their own whether actual emissions were calculated accurately. The only way for CBAM declarants to have any chance to be right about emissions lower than default value is if they receive emission data that comes from foreign manufacturers that have registered on the CBAM registry, and submitted third-party verified report. In accordance with Article 10 of the CBAM Regulation, installation operators in third countries can apply for registration, upload installation data, and submit emissions data via the CBAM Registry, which will open in January 2025. Operators in third countries who register and provide verified emission data via the CBAM Registry are likely to be more trustworthy in terms of quality of emission data since they are confident enough to share the information directly with the Commission. There is currently no obligation, no incentive even, under the CBAM Regulation for EU importers to make best efforts to import CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry. Thus, the draft Implementing Regulation does not directly include any wording on this. At the same time, we note that the draft IR provides in recital (10) that to ensure that only bona fide importers become authorised CBAM declarants, the competent authorities should make sure that the applicant has not been involved in a serious or repeated infringement of legislation including economic criminal offences, and that it has a good financial rating and provides detailed rules on criteria for granting the status of authorized CBAM declarant in Article 10 (serious or repeated infringements) and Article 11 (conditions for financial and operational capacity). We suggest the to amend Article 11.1(e), as indicated below. In addition, when the competent authority determines the revocation of the status of authorized CBAM declarants in accordance with Article 23 of the draft Implementing Regulation, the competent authority could consider the fact that that the authorized CBAM declarants made use of third country operators registered in the CBAM Registry as an indication of good faith to comply with CBAM obligations. Article 11.1 of the draft IR provides as follows: The criteria laid down in Article 17(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 shall be fulfilled where the following conditions are met: (a) the applicant is not subject to bankruptcy proceedings; (b) the applicant is not in arrears with the payment of customs duties, taxes or charges which are collected on or in connection with the import of goods, financial regulatory obligations and all other duties related to its economic activity; (c) the applicant demonstrates, on the basis of supporting documents provided together with the application, a sufficient financial standing to meet its obligations and fulfil commitments having regard to the type and volume of the economic activity performed by indicating the financial figures and any other financial information; (d) the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for fulfilment of the estimated obligations to surrender CBAM certificates, and has internal controls capable of preventing, detecting and correcting errors in CBAM declarations and CBAM certificates management, and of preventing and detecting illegal or any irregular transactions. (e) the applicant imports CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry in accordance with Article 14 of the CBAM Regulation, where possible.",

On October 30, 2024, the European Commission published a draft Commission implementing regulation (EU) .../... of XXX laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the conditions and procedures related to the status of authorised CBAM declarant, including its annex (“the draft implementing regulation”)! and invited feedback which, according to the European Commission, “will be taken into account for finalizing this initiative”. The feedback period is from 30 October 2024 to 27 November 2024 (midnight Brussels time). In response to this mvitation, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation (the “Ministry’”) would like to draw the European Commission’s attention to the European Union’s obligations in the WTO, in particular to Articles X:3 and XI:1 of the GATT 1994 and several provisions of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures, including its preamble and Articles 1 and 3. The above mentioned Articles of the WTO Agreements apply to the draft implementing regulation. The Ministry recalls that from January 1, 2026, the EU will prohibit the importation of goods covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956 into its customs territory for declarants without “the status of authorised CBAM declarant’”*. The EU requires obtaining this status “prior to importing goods into the customs territory of the Union”? Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 and the draft implementing regulation prescribe rules, conditions, and requirements for an application, including supporting documents and relevant information, as well as administrative procedures for obtaining and revoking the status of authorised CBAM declarant. Based on the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 and the draft implementing regulation, it is evident that not all applications for the status of authorised CBAM declarant will be approved. Therefore, the administrative procedures in question fall under the category of “non-automatic import licensing”, as defined by the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.\n' Published in EUR-L 30 October 2024, Document Number: Ares(2024)7706795, online: EUR-Lex ex, - Ares(2024)7706795 - EN - EUR-Lex.

Despite the EU's persistent claims that its CBAM is compatible with WTO law, the draft implementing regulation clearly contradicts these assertions. Reading Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 alongside the draft implementing regulation reveals a complex evolution of an already trade-restrictive and trade-distortive mechanism, escalating it to a next level of trade barriers and distortions. For example, the current text of the draft implementing regulation indicates potential violations of the EU’s obligations under Articles X:3, XI:1 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 1.2, 1.3 and 3.2 of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures. The Ministry recalls that Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994 forbids Members to institute or maintain prohibitions and restrictions, be it through import licenses or other measures, on the importation of any product of the territory of any other WTO Member. Article 1.2 of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures requires WTO Members to “ensure that the administrative procedures used to implement import licensing regimes are in conformity with the relevant provisions of GATT 1994 ... with a view to preventing trade distortions that may arise from an inappropriate operation of those procedures”. Article 1.3 provides that “[t]he rules for import licensing procedures shall be neutral in application and administered in a fair and equitable manner”. Furthermore, Article 3.2 prescribes that “[n]on-automatic licensing shall not have trade-restrictive or -distortive effects on imports additional to those caused by the imposition of the restriction”. Article X:3 of the GATT 1994 requires a prompt review and correction of administrative actions by an independent tribunal or a court. The result of our preliminary analysis demonstrates that the draft implementing regulation will have trade-restrictive and trade-distortive effects on imports. Such effects will be caused, inter alia, by the European Commission’s excessively high standards of protection against alleged risks posed by non-bona fide applicants and their associates. These negative effects on trade will also result from burdensome and costly administrative conditions and procedures outlined in various provisions of this implementing regulation, including: expanded applicant requirements (including coverage of other persons); extensive verification of eligibility; extensive documentation requirements; discriminatory differentiation among applicants; unnecessary consultation procedure, and delays in granting the status of authorised CBAM declarant.\n9. To demonstrate some of these concerns in the draft implementing regulation, the Ministry provides extracts from Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 and provisions of Articles 10(1), 10(3), 11(1), 12(1) and 12(2) of the draft implementing regulation in Tables 1-3 below. 10 Table | illustrates the extension of certain requirements initially applied to “an applicant’ to other persons. It also highlights that, previously, based on Article 5(e) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the EU only required a “declaration of honour” from the applicant — essentially a formal statement affirming that the conditions of this Article were met — without the need for supporting documentation. However, the draft implementing regulation reveals that the European Commission now requires more than just the declaration. For instance, the Commission proposed to prescribe that “the competent authorities shall request” criminal records of natural person- applicant and “the beneficial owner of the legal person acting as applicant and the managers of that legal 95 person .\nTable 1.

Table 2 provides another example of how the European Commission further expands certain\nconditions for obtaining the status of authorised CBAM declarant.\nTable 2. Expansion of requirements related to the applicant’s financial and operational capacity\nRegulation (EU) 2023/956\nDraft implementing regulation\nArticle 5(f)\nArticle 17(2)(b)\nArticle 11(1)\nThe application for an The criteria for granting the The criteria laid down in Article 17(2), point (b),\nauthorization shall include status of authorised CRAM of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 shall be fulfilled\nthe following information declarant shall be the where the following conditions are met:\nabout the applicant:\nfollowing:\n(a) the applicant is not subject to bankruptcy\n(f) information necessary (b) the applicant\nproceedings;\nto\ndemonstrate\nthe demonstrates its financial\napplicant’s financial and and operational capacity to (b) the applicant is not in arrears with the payment\noperational capacity to fulfil its obligations under of customs duties, taxes or charges which are\nfulfil its obligations under this Regulation;\ncollected on or in connection with the import of\nthis Regulation and, if (emphasis added)\ngoods, financial regulatory obligations and all\ndecided by the competent\nother duties related to its economic activity;\nauthority on the basis of a\nrisk assessment, supporting documents confirming that information, such as the profit and loss account and the balance sheet for up to the last three financial years for which the accounts were closed; (emphasis added)\n(c) the applicant demonstrates, on the basis of supporting documents provided together with the application, a sufficient financial standing to meet its obligations and fulfil commitments having regard to the type and volume of the economic activity performed by indicating the financial figures and any other financial information;\n(d) the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for fulfilment of the estimated obligations to surrender CBAM certificates, and has internal controls capable of preventing, detecting and correcting errors in CBAM declarations and CBAM certificates management, and of preventing and detecting illegal or any irregular transactions.\n12. Furthermore, the European Commission’s draft implementing regulation establishes the legal basis\nfor the competent authority’s discriminatory differentiation among applicants in the administrative\nassessment of whether they fulfilled certain conditions. In the third column of Table 2, the Ministry\nprovides the text of Article 11(1) of the draft implementing regulation. The following provisions\nof the same Article outline certain derogations or additional requirements, depending, inter alia, on\n“the specific characteristics of the applicant” and “the applicant’s annual estimated obligation to\nsurrender CBAM certificates”:\n2. If the applicant has been established for less than two years, the financial\ncapacity as referred to in Article 17(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU)\n2023/956 shall be checked assessed on the basis of records and information\nthat are available.\n3. When examining the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the\ncompetent authority shall take into account the specific characteristics of\nthe applicant, including the information on the estimated volume of imports\nprovided by the applicant in accordance with Article 5(5), point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\n4. Where the competent authority expects that the applicant’s annual\nestimated obligation to surrender CBAM certificates exceeds the amount of\nEUR 500 000, when examining the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this\nArticle, the competent authority shall request the financial statement audit\nreport, where applicable, in addition to the financial statements referred to\nin Article 5(5), point (f), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. (emphasis added)\n13. Turning to the required “consultation procedure” involving “the competent authorities in the other Member States and the Commission’, the Ministry highlights several reasons why these procedures and the required “confirmations” from “the consulted parties” constitute unnecessary procedural barriers. See Table 3 below with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 and the draft implementing regulation. 14 The first reason is that all information required by the EU CBAM will be accumulated in the CBAM registry, created by the EU to monitor compliance with the CBAM. The EU considers the CBAM registry as one of the key component of the CBAM framework. Both Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 and Article 12 of the draft implementing regulation require holding the consultation procedure “via the CBAM registry”. The European Commission describes the CBAM registry as “a standardized and secure electronic database containing data elements of CBAM declarations, of applications with a view to obtaining the status of CBAM declarants, registration of operators and installations, accredited CBAM verifiers, and providing handling and confidentiality 9 7 access, case . 15 The second reason is that the structure of the CBAM registry and its main functions ensure easy for authorities, the EU authorities and the European Commission. 8 access competent customs Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 requires the European Commission to “make the information in the CBAM registry available automatically and in real time to customs authorities and authorities”.’ If the information must be available “automatically and in real time”,\ncompetent\n6 Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 states, in particular, that the consultation procedure shall involve the competent authorities in the other Member States and the Commission.\n7 See Article 3 of the proposed Commission implementing regulation (EU) .../... of XXX laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the CBAM registry, online: EUR-Lex - Ares(2024)7742910 - EN - EUR-Lex.\n8 The structure and functions of the CBAM registry described in Articles 4 and 3, respectively, of the proposed\nare Commission implementing regulation (EU) .../... of XXX laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the CBAM registry, online: EUR-Lex_- Ares(2024)7742910 - EN - EUR-Lex. The CBAM registry shall consists of special portals, including: the CBAM Declarants Portal; the CBAM National Competent Authorities Portal, the CBAM European Commission Portal, the CBAM Operators Portal. The CBAM registry shall enable communication, notification, registration, checks and information exchange between the Commission, the competent authorities, authorised CBAM declarants, applicants, persons for whom the status of authorised CBAM declarants was revoked, and operators. It shall also allow for information exchange with customs authorities. ° added.\nEmphasis\nthen additional “confirmations” are not necessary. Another indication of the excessive nature of the\nconsultation procedure is the provision indicating that the consulted parties may not respond to\nrequests from the competent authority. Article 13(4) of the draft implementing regulation states:\nWhere the consulted parties do not respond within the deadline established\nfor the consultation in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, the conditions and criteria for which the consultation took place shall be deemed to be fulfilled.'° 16. The third reason is the condition for the initiation of the consultation procedure by the competent authority, namely its intension “to grant the status of authorised CBAM declarant”. Such an intention must be based on the competent authority’s examination of the application, including its information, and the applicant’s fulfilment of the legal requirements (conditions). Otherwise, the competent authority’s actions and decisions would be arbitrary and illegal. If the conditions for the application for authorization described in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 are met, the applicant shall be granted the status of authorised CBAM declarant without delay. 17. The CBAM registry shall have information updated in real time and provide for “the interoperability” between the CBAM registry and the customs systems “to ensure that data is cross-checked accurately, efficiently and confidentially”.'! Thus, an official of the competent authority will have access to all necessary data to check and re-check it multiple times: immediately after receiving the application, during its assessment, and at the time of the final decision. There is no need to waste 15 working days waiting for “confirmations” in the consultation procedure!” when all relevant information 1s collected in one place — the CBAM registry — and all interested parties have easy access to it to update the information in real time. In other words, the consultation to the and barrier.\nprocedure appears duplicate process\nare, therefore, an unnecessary\nTable 3. The internal consultation procedure: an unnecessary barrier causing delays in granting the status of authorised CBAM declarant\n'0 Emphasis added.\n'! Articles 2 and 14 of the proposed Commission implementing regulation (EU) .../... of XXX laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the CBAM registry (emphasis added), online: EUR-Lex - Ares(2024)7742910 - EN - EUR-Lex.\n2 Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 provides, inter alia, that “[t]he consultation procedure shall involve the competent authorities in the other Member States and the Commission and shall not exceed 15 working days”.\n8\nArticle 17(1) of Regulation (EU) Articles 12(1) and 12(2) of the draft implementing regulation 2023/956\n1 Where an application for an authorisation is submitted in accordance with Article 5, the competent authority in the Member State in which the applicant is established shall grant the status of authorised CBAM declarant provided that the criteria set out in paragraph 2 of this Article are complied with. The status of authorised CBAM declarant shall be recognised in all Member States.\n1. The competent authority shall initiate, in electronic format via the CBAM registry, the consultation procedure involving consulted parties referred to in Article 171), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 (the ‘consultation procedure’) within 45 calendar days from the moment where it received an application in relation to which it intends to grant the status of authorised CBAM declarant.\n2. During the consultation procedure, the competent authority shall require confirmation from the consulted parties of the following:\nBefore granting the status of authorised CBAM declarant, the competent authority shall conduct a consultation procedure on the application for an authorisation via the CBAM registry. The consultation procedure shall involve the competent authorities in the other Member States and the Commission and shall not exceed 15 working days.\n(a) that they do not have any objections to granting the status of authorised CBAM declarant;\n(b) that the applicant has not submitted an application for authorisation in another Member State;\n(emphasis added)\n(emphasis added)\n3 Article 5(2) of the draft implementing regulation.\n'4 Article 5(3) of the draft implementing regulation (emphasis added).\n9\n(c) that the applicant has not been granted an authorisation in another Member State;\n(d) that the applicant has not had an authorisation revoked in\nanother Member State.\n18. Another important issue is the\nand costly delays in granting the status of authorised\nunnecessary CBAM declarant. According to Article 4(1) of the draft implementing regulation, “[t]he competent authority shall assess the application within 120 calendar days from the date of receipt of the application”. If the competent authority requests additional information, this deadline may be extended by up to 30 calendar days.'? In cases where additional information is requested, the assessment of an application should be completed within 180 days from the date of receipt of the application. Another concern is that the deadline for processing the application may also be extended for “investigations” into whether the applicant has been involved in serious or repeated\ninfringements.!> The draft implementing regulation does not provide details on the deadlines for such “investigations” or the associated delays in granting the status of authorised CBAM declarant. 19 Depending on the results of its “assessment” or, in other words, the basis for determining its intention (to refuse or grant the status), the competent authority will either inform the applicant of the refusal or initiate the consultation procedure. Article 12(1) of the draft implementing regulation requires the competent authority to initiate the consultation procedure “within 45 calendar days from the moment where it received an application in relation to which it intends to grant the status of authorised CBAM declarant’”.!° Importantly, within these 45 days, the competent authority must be able to make a sufficient legal assessment of the application in order to formulate its intentions. Even if this deadline is extended by up to 30 calendar days in cases where additional information is requested, the total period will still be 75 days instead of 180 days! The Ministry stresses that delays in obtaining authorizations increase the costs of conducting business and international trade. 20 The Ministry would also like to comment on Article 6 of the draft implementing regulation, titled “Intended negative decision and appeal”, and to stress the importance of effective remedies. Article 6 does not include a provision requiring the competent authority to issue a final decision to the applicant, to register that decision and to explain, within it, the right of all concerned parties to appeal the decision in court. It is unclear from the text of Article 6 whether the “observation” submitted by the applicant will be treated by the competent authority as merely an “observation” (the right to be heard) or as a formal appeal. The current wording of Article 6 creates legal uncertainty and does not require informing applicants and other affected parties of their right to appeal an administrative decision in the European court system. 21 Therefore, it appears that the text of Article 6 does not comply with Article X:3 of the GATT 1994, Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 (see Table 4 below) and Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 47 guarantees everyone the fundamental right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. This Article states, in particular:\n'S Recital 8 of the preamble of the draft implementing regulation.\n‘6 Emphasis added.\n10\nEveryone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union\nare violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in\ncompliance with the conditions laid down in this Article.\nEveryone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time\nby an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law.\nEveryone shall have the possibility of being advised, defended and represented.!”\nTable 4.

Where the competent authority finds that the criteria set out in paragraph 2 of this Article are not fulfilled, or where the applicant has failed to provide information listed in Article 5(5), the granting of the status of authorised CBAM declarant shall be refused. Such decision to refuse the status of authorised CBAM declarant shall provide the reasons for the refusal and include information on the possibility to appeal. (emphasis added)\nIntended negative decision and appeal\n1. When the competent authority intends to refuse granting the status of authorised CBAM declarant, the competent authority shall inform the applicant thereof and shall provide the applicant with the possibility to submit observations.\n2. The competent authority shall state the following in the communication to the applicant:\n(a) the intention of and the reasons for refusing to grant the status\nof authorised CBAM declarant;\n(b) the period within which the applicant can submit its observations.\n3. The period referred to in point (b) of the second paragraph shall run from the date on which the competent authority notified the applicant of the communication and shall not exceed 30 calendar days.\n4. After the expiry of the period referred to in point (b) of the\nsecond paragraph the competent authority, taking into account\nany observations submitted by the applicant, may proceed\nwith its final decision making.\n5.

In conclusion, the Ministry would like to reiterate that the European Union, as a WTO Member,\nshall comply with its WTO obligations. The Ministry urges the European Commission to ensure\nthat its regulations and practices are in accordance with WTO Agreements, including Articles XI:1\nof the GATT 1994 and Articles 1 and 3 of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.\n23 The Ministry stresses that measures aimed at protecting the environment and combating climate change shall not be used as a pretext to conduct protectionist trade policy and requests the European Commission to carefully consider these comments and take them into account.\n2K 8 ok\n12"

        "feedback": "Federal Association of German Industries (BDI) on the draft Implementing Regulation Authorising CBAM Declarants to avoid additional and unnecessary bureaucracy! AEOS should also be able to act as CBAM declarant companies established in the European Union and involved in customs operations can qualify for the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO). AEO status is one of the largest security initiatives in the world. Many economic operators are already authorised as AEOs in Germany and the EU. The requirements for an authorised CBAM declarant are a small excerpt of the AEO Requirements Catalogue. With regard to the applicant’s reputation, in addition to tax and customs offences or general significant breaches of the law, the CBAM declarant also takes into account the breaches of market abuse rules and the CBAM Regulation itself. By way of derogation from the AEO rules, which define a three-year period, the CBAM shall be based on 5 years. AEO status should be taken into account when authorising CBAM declarants. This would be beneficial for both businesses and national competent authorities (NCAs) in terms of avoiding extra burden, as most of the information to be provided by the applicant coincides. AEOS are obliged to report changes independently. They must also be reported if problems arise with the customs process being handled in accordance with the law. It would therefore be useful in any case for AEOs to operate as CBAM declarants without any additional barriers. This would save time and effort for all involved, and companies already regularly prove to the customs authorities that they are reliable as AEOs. At the same time, it would make the status of AEO more attractive to European operators. Extremely tight time for authorisation threatens to cause serious problems. The deadline of 180 days (including queries) appears very generous. According to the Commission, the portal should only be available in Q1 2025, i.e. by the end of March. This would leave only 3 months, during which all potential declarants can/must apply for the status in order to secure a reply (not necessarily a commitment) before the end of 2025. Importers of CBAM goods who (may) act only later in terms of authorisation are facing massive problems. Even if a company were to be newly established later next year (differentiated steering will lead to start-ups), this would be very problematic. In any case, therefore, there is still a need for a kind of hardship or derogation rule with suspensive effect which allows subsequent authorisation (after 1.1.2026) without interruption of value chains, as CBAM goods may no longer be imported from 1 January 2026. The current draft should clarify what immediate dependencies will arise in the future between CBAM authorisation and customs status. Would companies lose their CBAM status if they breach AEO obligations and vice versa?",

Or if they should apply in every Member State they operate? Or in every Member State they are established in? Could they only apply once for the CBAM declarant status, to cover all of their CBAM-scoped imports into EU? “Any importer established in a Member State shall, prior to importing goods into the customs territory of the Union, apply for the status of authorized CBAM declarant” It seems one can only apply in one MS (art. 12(2)) only, however, one needs to have a good standing in all member states (e.g. Art.19(2)). Please clarify where a company importing CBAM-scoped goods into a number of EU Member States shall apply for the CBAM declarant status. It is also not clear (also not from CBAM Regulation 2023/956, art. 5), if importers importing CBAM-scoped goods into multiple EU countries shall: (i) report and surrender CBAM certificates in each relevant country independently (as was the case with reporting in the transitional phase), OR (ii) if they can report (and surrender certificates) jointly for applicable imports in all relevant MS. Please clarify. CBAM applicant and declarant data Art. 2 mandates keeping the application information up to date (2023/956, art. 5(5)) during the application process. Is that also required once the CBAM declarant status is granted? If so, what are the implications of a subsequent change? Please clarify. Response period on intended declarant status revocation Art. 23(3): if the authority intends to revoke the declarant status, the declarant only has up to 10 working days to respond. It is very short.\nPlease consider prolonging the response time for the declarants.\nIn addition, we would like to share one comment on COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2023/1773. In article 4 it is stated that usage of default values is only permissible in 2024 during the transitional period. However, we have noticed while compiling our reports during the transitional period, that in several cases the quarterly monetary value of our imports from a particular supplier is rather low. In such a case, the burden to collect and validate the installation emission information is disproportionate to the theoretical carbon emission differences (or achievable emission savings). In the spirit of the keeping European industry competitive and avoiding disproportionate burden, we would like to ask for the CBAM regulation (EU) 2023/956 to be modified to allow for using the Commission-defined default values past the current transitional period, including using the defaults for the declarations leading to CBAM certificate surrendering (if necessary, up to a defined threshold of value of the\nquarterly monetary\nimport)."

        "feedback": "We welcome the European Commissions efforts to establish clear rules for the authorisation of CBAM declarants. However, certain aspects of the draft Implementing Regulation require refinement to enhance clarity, fairness, and efficiency. Below, we present our consolidated recommendations. Firstly, Article 4(2) introduces the concepts of expert conclusions and third-party conclusions as tools for competent authorities to evaluate applications. However, these terms are not defined in the CBAM Regulation nor in the draft Implementing Regulation, creating uncertainty about the entities qualified to provide such conclusions and the criteria for their evaluation. We recommend explicitly defining these terms in the legal text or adding a recital to clarify which entities can provide such conclusions and their required qualifications. Secondly, the deadlines for assessing applications under Articles 4, 5, and 6 are complex and interlinked, potentially causing confusion for applicants. Article 4(1) provides a 120-calendar day deadline, Article 5(2) permits a 30-day extension if additional information is required, and Article 5(3) states the total assessment period cannot exceed 180 days. Additionally, Article 6 allows a period of up to 30 days for applicants to submit observations to a negative decision. The relationship between these provisions is unclear, especially regarding how extensions impact the overall timeline. We recommend revising the text to explicitly clarify how these deadlines interact, providing applicants with a clear and predictable timeline for application processing. Further, Article 6(3) grants competent authorities the discretion to set the period for submitting observations to a negative decision, with a maximum of 30 days. Without a minimum threshold, applicants could face unreasonably short periods, disadvantaging their ability to respond effectively. We suggest amending the text to include a minimum period of 15 calendar days, ensuring fairness while preserving flexibility. In addition, Article 11 outlines conditions for financial and operational capacity, requiring applicants to demonstrate their ability to fulfil obligations under the CBAM Regulation. For importers with Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, these requirements are redundant, as AEO certification already involves rigorous assessments of financial and operational reliability. We recommend exempting AEO-certified importers from demonstrating additional financial and operational capacity or, alternatively, recognising AEO status as a key factor during evaluations. This would streamline the process for trusted operators without compromising oversight. Finally, Article 14 requires applicants to provide a financial guarantee, which may impose an unnecessary burden on AEO-certified importers. Given the robust financial assessments integral to AEO certification, these importers should either be exempt from providing a guarantee or allowed to provide a reduced amount. This adjustment would balance administrative efficiency with the CBAMs regulatory objectives.

Deadlines for Assessing Applications (Articles 4, 5, and 6)\nZa,\ni=\nDea\n—\nEat oT Se 1\nSa\n(ego\nEUROPEAN ALUMI NIUM — FEEDBACK TO THE DRAFT IMPLEMENTING REGULATION FOR THE STATUS OF AUTHORISED CBAM DECLARANT\nSS\n=—S YY\nPOSITION PAPER\n=\n=\nThis position paper aims to provide feedback on the European Commission’s draft Implementing Regulation on conditions and procedures related to the status of authorised CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) declarants. While we support the overarching goals of the regulation, we believe there are several areas that need clarification or adjustment to ensure a transparent, fair, and efficient process for applicants. The following points highlight our key concerns and recommendations.\nArticle 4(2) refers to “expert conclusions” and “third-party conclusions,” but neither term is defined in the draft text nor in the CBAM Regulation. This creates ambiguity around which entities can provide these conclusions and how they will be evaluated by the competent authorities.\nRecommendation: We recommend adding a recital or further clarifying in the legal text the entities that may qualify as experts or third parties for the purposes of these conclusions. This would provide greater clarity and ensure a more transparent authorisation process.\nThe deadlines for assessing applications for authorised CBAM declarant status are complex and interconnected. Several provisions within Articles 4, 5, and 6 affect these timelines, creating potential confusion for applicants:\ne Article 4(1) sets a 120-calendar day deadline for the assessment. Article 5(2) allows for an extension of up to 30 days if additional information is required. Article 5(3) states that the overall assessment must not exceed 180 days. Article 6(2) and (3) provide a 30-day period for applicants to submit observations following a negative decision.\nThere is a lack of clarity in the relationship between these derogations and the deadlines for applicants.\nRecommendation: We recommend clarifying the interaction between these deadlines in the legal text. Applicants, especially importers or indirect customs representatives, should have a clear understanding of the\nWY\nPage | 1 iw\nGam\noe\nie a\n=\nMH\niis\neA\nPE poms\nWy, Wh\napplication process, particularly given the tight timeline before the definitive period commences. Clear guidance on how extensions and additional information requests affect the overall timeline is essential.\n3. Period for Submitting Observations to a Negative Decision (Article 6)\nArticle 6(3) gives competent authorities the discretion to determine the length of the period for submitting observations to a negative decision, with a maximum of 30 calendar days. This flexibility could lead to extremely short timeframes for applicants, potentially disadvantaging them.\nRecommendation: We recommend amending Article 6(3) to establish a minimum period for submitting observations, with a range between 15 and 30 calendar days. This would ensure that applicants have a reasonable amount of time to respond, fostering fairness in the process.\n4. Conditions for Financial and Operational Capacity (Article 11)\nArticle 11 outlines the financial and operational capacity criteria that applicants must meet to obtain authorised CBAM declarant status. However, for importers who already hold the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, the requirements for demonstrating financial and operational capacity seem redundant, as AEO status already implies robust financial and operational assessments.\nRecommendation: We recommend exempting importers with AEO status from demonstrating additional financial and operational capacity. Alternatively, the AEO status should be explicitly recognised as one of the primary factors in the assessment of these conditions, streamlining the process for qualified operators.\n5. Provision of a Guarantee (Article 14)\nArticle 14 requires applicants to provide a guarantee, as specified in Article 17(5) of the CBAM Regulation. Importers who hold AEO status may already be subject to rigorous financial requirements, making the provision of a guarantee redundant or unnecessarily burdensome.\nRecommendation: We recommend exempting AEO-certified importers from providing a guarantee or, at the very least, reducing the required guarantee amount for these operators. This would reduce administrative burdens for trusted economic operators while maintaining the integrity of the CBAM system.\nWy\nPage ]2 iw\nFor further information:\nHere our answer to the European Commission study on the CBAM scope extension to downstream products (July 2024) Here our letter to DG TAXUD on CBAM double reporting and taxation concerns (February 2024) Here our position paper on the Draft Implementing Regulation on Reporting Obligations during the transitional period (July 2023) Here our memo on the methodology for indirect emissions in CBAM (May 2023) Here our Position Paper on why alumina should not be included in CBAM (November 2022) Here CRU External Study “Assessment of European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Regulation” for European Aluminium (May 2022) Here our detailed position paper on the proposed CBAM (October 2021) 1 pager on why a CBAM on indirect emission will increase global emissions (June 2022) 1 pager on why indirect emissions in CBAM will harm European production (October 2021) e Here our non-paper CBAM and excise duty tax design (February 2021)\nFor more information on European Aluminium’s work on CBAM, all papers, external studies and memos are available at the “Climate & Energy Section on our Website under “CBAM”.\nEmanuele Manigrassi Director, Climate Change & Energy M +32 471 73 53 06 manigrassi@european-aluminium.eu\nLorraine Schréter Climate & Energy Policy Assistant M +32 499 65 12 77 schroeter@european-aluminium.eu\nA\nEuropean =\nAluminium\nWy\nPage 13 iw"

        "pdf_text": "Opinion of the Korean Steel Industry on the EU CBAM Implementing Regulation\n2024. 11. 26., Korea Iron and Steel Association\n<Introduction>\nThe Korea Iron and Steel Association represents the Korean steel\nindustry and has a total of 45 steel companies and distributors as\nmembers. Regarding the two EU CBAM(Carbon Border Adjustment\nMechanism) Implementing Regulations announced on October 30\nand 31, 2024, our association would like to submit the following\nopinions to the EU Commission on behalf of the Korean steel\nindustry.\n* Authorizing CBAM declarant('24.10.30), Eatablishment of CBAM registry('24.10.31)\nOn July 14, 2021, the “EU CBAM’ legislative bill with the goal of\ncarbon neutrality in the European continent was finalized in the EU Parliament in April 2023. The purpose of the bill is to alleviate\nconcerns over carbon leakage due to differences in carbon regulation levels between countries. The Korean steel industry recognizes the need for global carbon reduction and has _ been communicating and cooperating with the EU Commission closely\nthrough interviews and submission of official opinions on the\nCBAM and its implementing regulation.\n-1-\nThe above CBAM implementing regulations contain some\nunreasonable and uncertain elements in the detailed procedures.\nThis will significantly increase the economic and administrative\nburden on exporters from third countries, and. will Cause\nuncertainty in trade and industry between the two countries.\nAccordingly, the Korea Iron and Steel Association strongly urges\nthat smooth trade relations and mutually complementary industrial\nstructures between the two. countries can be maintained by\nresolving uncertainty through the review of the EU’s CBAM\nimplementing regulations.\n<Main Opinion\n1. Necessity to shorten the review and approval period for CBAM\ndeclarant application\nAccording to Article 4 of the Authorizing CBAM declarant\nImplementing regulation, the CBAM authority can review the\ndeclarant application submitted by the importer for 120 days. In\naddition, according to Article 5 of the same regulation, if there are\nadditional documents requested by the CBAM authority, the review\nperiod can take up to 180 days from the date of application. In\naddition, there is no specific period for the reassessment of\ndeclarant qualification under Articles 19 and 20 of the same regulation.\n-2-\nThis application review and approval period is considerably\nexcessive, as it could take up to 6 months from application to final\napproval if an issue such as a change in the declarant arises during\nthe definitive period('26~), which could restrict imports during that\nperiod. In addition, in order to import products subject to CBAM\nwithout a hitch from January 1, 2026, the declarant approval\nprocedures for importers must be completed by then. However,\nconsidering the number of importers in the EU, application\ndocuments, and review period, there are concerns that not all\napplications may be approved by 2025.\nAccordingly, the Korean steel industry requests a shortening of the\nabsolute review and approval period, temporary import permits\nwhen the review period is exceeded, simplification of the review\nprocedure for applications as a declarant for importers who\nfaithfully continued fulfilling their reporting obligations during the\ntransition period('23.10~'25), and specification of a declarant\nqualification reassessment period.\n2. Necessity to specify the types of information that third-country\nproducers can enter directly into the registry\nAccording to Article 10 of the Establishment of CBAM registry\nImplementing regulation, third-country producers can directly enter\nbasic information such as company name, address, and_ business\n-3-\nregistration number, as well as information on production facilities\nand products, into the registry. This can also be confirmed through\nthe ‘EU CBAM Q&A’ released on October 24, 2024.\nHowever, since the types of sensitive information(emissions\ninformation, etc.) that third-country producers can directly enter are\nnot specified in detail in this regulation, confusion may arise in\ncarrying out future work.\nTo avoid the above confusion, the Korean steel industry requests the\nEU Commission to provide specific details on the types of sensitive\ninformation that third-country producers can register directly.\n3. Other Suggestions\nThere were instances in the early transition period where technical\nfaults within the registry caused difficulties in CBAM reporting.\nAccordingly, we request that the EU Commission prevent technical\nfaults in a series of computer work processes, such as submitting\nthe declarant application and uploading data from third-country\nproducers.\nAs mentioned above, the Korea Iron and Steel Association presents\nits opinion to the EU Commission on behalf of the Korean steel\nindustry on the EU’s CBAM Implementing Regulations.\n-A-"

We therefore appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on the approval of CBAM declarants.\nPOINTS TO CLARIFY\n> Article 6 (Intended negative decision and appeal)\n2. The competent authority shall state the following in the communication to the applicant:\n(a) the intention of and the reasons for refusing to grant the status of authorised CBAM declarant;\n(b) the period within which the applicant can submit its observations.\n3. The period referred to in point (b) of the second paragraph shall run from the date on which the competent authority notified the applicant of the communication and shall not exceed 30\ncalendar days.\nPlease clarify what is expected to be submitted to the competent authority as the applicant's \"observations\". In view of the fact that the procedure of notification of the intended negative decision is situated between the request for additional information by the competent authority (Article 5) and the appeal (Article 6(5)), it should be made clear what unique role is expected of such intermediate procedures. Otherwise, it cannot function well, as it either duplicates and prolongs the request for additional information or does not allow sufficient time (i.e. 30 calendar days) for the preparation of the evidence.\n> Article 9 (Status of authorisation and CBAM accounts)\n\n| 1. An authorisation shall be registered in the CBAM registry in one of the following =\n1 <https: ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have- our-say/initiatives/14116-Carbon-border- adjust ment-mechanism-CBAM-authorising-CBAM-declarants en>\nCe ee ene\nee\njapan\ni=jusiness\n| ‘eouncil in\nN=surope\nDate: 27 November 2024\nstatuses:\n(a) ‘active’;\n(b) ‘revoked’.\n2. Where a CBAM authorisation is revoked the CBAM account shall remain under the status ‘closed’ in accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 until the fifth year following the revocation._A ‘closed’ CBAM account shall be reopened by the competent authority allowing the owner to fulfil a obligation to surrender the correct number of CBAM certificates further to the review of a submitted CBAM declaration in accordance with Article 19(5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nPlease clarify how the 'closed' account can be reactivated. We believe that it is not clear whether the CBAM registrant whose account is closed is expected to open a new active account or to reopen the closed account, which retains the information once registered.\nABOUT JBCE\nFounded in 1999, Japan Business Council in Europe (JBCE) is a leading European organisation representing the interests of over 100 multinational companies.

It represents the overall interests of its approximately 175.000 member companies vis-à-vis policy and administration, promotes the business economy and takes into account the economic interests of individual sectors and businesses in a balanced way. The CCI provides support and advice to public authorities on economic matters, thus giving an important voice to the regional economy. The EU CBAM system provides that only authorised CBAM declarants will be able to import into the EU CBAM-affected goods as of 2026. The submitted draft Regulation sets out the framework and deadlines for the authorisation process of the competent authorities in the respective Member States. In the following cases, the envisaged authorisation process does not seem appropriate: 1. Companies with few consignments/small quantities: Analyses of past imports of CBAM goods have shown that between 80 and 90 % of importers import only a small number of consignments and/or small quantities. However, the authorisation process proposed in this Regulation is clearly based on importers of large quantities or numerous consignments. Neither this process nor the trading of certificates is economically feasible for the majority of importers with a small number of consignments. It also imposes unnecessary burdens on the competent licensing authorities. CBAM has the objective of border adjustment and not the objective of creating additional hurdles for importers. For the vast majority of importers, an alternative method of collecting border adjustment should be established. 2. Delays in the authorisation process: What happens if an application for authorisation is not decided by the competent authority before 1.1.2026? When introducing a new, untested administrative procedure covering all importers of CBAM goods in the EU, with a duration of several months, it is foreseeable that never all companies will receive their approval as CBAM reporters in a timely manner. At the very least, provision must be made for these undertakings to continue to import in the form of a provisional authorisation or an alternative procedure. An alternative procedure for companies with a small number of consignments automatically mitigates this problem by significantly reducing the need for authorisations. 3. New importers of CBAM goods: From 2026 onwards, EU companies will continue to import CBAM goods for the first time for different reasons. In this context, is it appropriate and is it for the EU’s competitiveness to provide for an authorisation process of several months before a pack can be imported? An alternative procedure to authorisation as a CBAM declarant is also required for these cases. What can be an alternative process for the CBAM? We propose that border adjustment be collected by the customs administration in the context of import customs clearance. All relevant information (product code, origin and weight) is available and emission values can be based on the country-specific default values available from 2026. The alternative procedure should be open to all importers. This would prevent the problems described above. Companies could decide for themselves which procedure is better suited to them: Authorisation and allowance trading or, in some cases, a higher carbon price without additional significant administrative burden. In view of the foreseeable problems described above, in particular for companies with few CBAM import consignments or small quantities, we consider it essential to provide an alternative to the envisaged authorisation process and certificate trading.",

The association represents the common economic, technical and scientific interests of this unique and diverse industry. VDMA member companies produce many different technological solutions for climate protection and are enablers in the transition to a net-zero economy. However, VDMA believes the CBAM mechanism still needs significant improvement in order to ensure both the competitiveness of European export-oriented companies in the mechanical engineering sector and to attain the desire climate-impact of the CBAM. Considering the authorization of CBAM declarants, our member companies take a cautious view on placing the authorization burden highly on the national authorities considering the lack of administrative support at national level during the first year of CBAM implementation. Simplifying this process would mean that CBAM declarants are given the possibility to be automatically registered as CBAM declarants given the fact that this the same personnel internally in a company dealing with the current and future CBAM implementation. In more concrete points: 1. The implementing act lacks clarity on the absence of an assessment response by NCAs for an authorization request within the dedicated timeframe of 120 days. This would mean that companies would not be allowed to import goods in the absence of authorization. In Germany, the NCA did not respond to any individual request during the first year of CBAM implementation raising concerns for their fast reaction to further CBAM actions. 2. The timeframe of 120 days shall be shortened aiming to accelerate the whole process and to not jeopardize imports of goods in case of delay. Building on the commitment demonstrated by companies in prioritizing CBAM implementation, NCAs must expedite their efforts to ensure a more efficient and effective implementation of the mechanism. 3. With the goal of securing legal certainty, further clarification on the conditions under Art. 11. 1 (c) and (d) would be welcomed for better preparation for the application, less room for national interpretation and accelerated assessment by the NCA. 4. The information provided to the NCA under Art. 12.5 should be strictly between the consulted party and the NCA and not open to all consulted parties as this would endanger data security and protection of trade secrets. 5. An extension of the deadlines of 15 working days under Art. 14.1 and 27.2 (b) would provide companies with the necessary time to address overlapping reporting obligations and well-prepare its point of view for the right to be heard process under Art. 27. 6. VDMA calls the European Commission to provide guarantees for safeguarding company and personal data including cyber security standards aiming to protect sensitive data on the CBAM registry. These guarantees could streamline and facilitate the process of obtaining emissions data from suppliers, as concerns related to data security are often cited by suppliers as a barrier to sharing the necessary information.",

We support the Commissions goal of clarifying the criteria and processes required to become an authorised CBAM declarant, granting further rules and guiding details for both applicants and relevant Competent Authorities. In this context, this paper addresses the shortcomings of the draft text currently under public consultation, providing suggestions to improve the texts clarity and increase procedural certainty. We identified certain aspects of the draft Implementing Regulation that could be fine-tuned and thus provide the recommendations below: 1. Article 4(2) Definitions - In Article 4(2), points (a) and (b), respectively, refer to expert conclusions and third party conclusions, noting that conclusions by these entities may be considered by the relevant Competent Authorities to check if the criteria described in Article 17(2) of the CBAM Regulation are met. However, these terms are not defined in the draft text, nor in the CBAM Regulation. Recommendation: Give an indication of which entities can be categorised to fit within the concepts of expert and third party conclusions (e.g. by adding a new recital) to provide greater clarity and a more transparent authorisation process. 2. Deadlines for assessing applications - Several Articles in the draft text intertwine and ultimately impact the deadlines imposed on the Competent Authorities for assessing applications for authorised CBAM states: Article 4(1) states Competent Authorities are granted up to 120 calendar days to assess applications for authorised CBAM declarant status. Article 5(2) enables Competent Authorities to extend the deadlines set in Article 4(1) by up to 30 calendar days if they intend to request more information from the applicant. Article 5(3) notes that the assessment of an application for authorised CBAM declarant status where additional information is requested by the Competent Authority to the applicant cannot exceed 180 days from the date of reception of the application. Article 6(2) and (3), respectively state that Competent Authorities aiming to submit a negative decision to an application, must communicate to the applicant the reasons for refusing and provide a period of up to 30 calendar days for the applicant to submit observations. Recommendation: Clarify in the legal text the relationship between the derogations for extending the deadlines in order to provide more clarity for applicants. Importers or indirect customs representatives applying for authorised CBAM status should have a clear understanding of the application process, particularly considering the tight timeline until the effective start of the definitive period. 3. Period for submitting observations to a negative decision - The provisions in Article 6(2) and (3) provide the Competent Authority with the freedom to set up any length for the period in which the applicant can submit its observations to the Competent Authoritys communication on its intention to refuse granting status of authorised CBAM declarant, with a maximum of 30 calendar days. The current draft legal framework is unfair for applicants, considering that if a minimum threshold is not clearly spelled out in the legal text, the Competent Authorities will be allowed to set up extremely short periods for submitting observations, leading to a highly disfavourable scenario for applicants. Hence, the Competent Authority should also be bound by a minimum threshold for the period it sets up for the applicants observations. Recommendation: Amend the legal text in Article 6(3) to set up a minimum threshold for the period granted by the Competent Authority to the applicant for the latter to submit its observations (e.g. between 15 and 30 calendar days).",

        "feedback": "1.Clarification： (1).Application Conditions. §2.(3) Importers face difficulties in estimating the volume and value of EU CBAM imports. According to Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the draft, and Article 5, Paragraph 5(g) of Regulation 2023/956, importers need to estimate future import volumes and values. What documentation is required to meet EU regulations? If actual imports exceed estimated volumes, are there penalties? (2)Application Process - Consultation Procedure.§12(1) Article 12, Paragraph 1of the draft requires the competent authority to initiate a consultation procedure with consulted parties within 45 days after expressing intent to approve a CBAM declarant application. Does this 45-day period start from the date of application receipt or from the date the competent authority expresses intent of approval? 2.Request： (1).Application Process. §4(1)+§5(3) Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the draft allows the competent authority a maximum of 120 days to process the authorization for a CBAM declarant. Additionally, Article 5, Paragraph 3 permits up to a 180-day extension if additional documents are requested by the competent authority. This means the total time for CBAM declarants to obtain authorization from EU member state authorities could extend up to 300 days. If imports cannot proceed during this period, it may impact importers operations. It is suggested to shorten the processing period or provide corresponding support measures. (2).Application Conditions - Financial Capability. §11(1)(d) Article 17, Paragraph 2(d) of the CBAM regulation requires only the financial capability of the applicant. However, Article 11, Paragraph 1(d) of the draft expands this requirement to include internal control mechanisms, even covering internal measures to prevent and detect illegal activities, which may exceed the mandate of the primary law. It is recommended to adhere to the financial capability provisions of the CBAM regulation to avoid overstepping the primary laws authorization.",

In (17) it says there should be enough time \"for the development of the relevant IT system of the CBAM registry to make it fully operational by 1 January 2026.\" and in Article 5 paragraph 3. \"The assessment of an application in the cases where additional information is requested in accordance with this Article shall not exceed 180 days from the date of receipt of the application.\" If with beginning of January 1st 2026 only authorised CBAM declarants are authorised for related imports, which will then be the guaranteed first day of open application process on the CBAM registry? With in the past experienced challanges to upload data on CBAM registry/portal it is of great importance not to endanger the business due to IT driven issues for CBAM declarant application. Or are there any plans of the EU Commission to still allow imports of CBAM related goods for companies that have submitted their applications prior January 1st 2026 without having already received an authorisation with beginning of 2026 (as being the case for REACh applications under certain circumstances)? We really appreciate to receive a clear timeline for the starting of the application process to assure compliant business processes with beginning of 2026. Thank you very much!",

        "feedback": "The decision by the competent authority to be authorised as a CBAM declarant shall, in principle, take place within 120 days (but: Deadline up to 180 days) the draft does not regulate what happens if this deadline is exceeded (e.g. automatic authorisation as CBAM declarant). According to media reports, around 20.000 companies are affected by CBAM in Germany. The fact that the DEHSt creates time to allow all in time seems rather unlikely. There are no exceptions (also a company with 1 relevant import per year is required to register). An exception by weight (except for the EUR 150 limit) makes sense here. For each change, DEHSt must initiate a review procedure. The fact that the data must be kept up-to-date or adapted in the event of legislative changes seems reasonable, but every time all notifiers are amended, it is a huge burden for the authority and businesses. The meaning is not clear here either. In the event of non-compliance, a (fairly strict) revocation procedure is initiated. Of course, the authority should have the possibility to withdraw the status of CBAM declarant. It does not seem to us to make sense that proceedings are initiated for every infringement of such a small size. This should only be done at the discretion of the Authority.",

In this consultation, we would like to raise the following points: 1. Fecc supports the initiative to authorise CBAM declarants to ensure compliance with CBAM regulations. However, the process must be clear and streamlined to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens. 2. The requirement for authorised declarants may disproportionately impact SMEs, potentially reducing their competitiveness due to the additional administrative and financial burdens. o The criteria for authorisation and the specific steps involved in the process are currently unclear. Detailed guidelines and support from the Commission would be beneficial. o The Commission could provide simplified procedures, financial support, and training programs to help SMEs navigate the authorisation process more efficiently. General Impact on SMEs 1. In the short-term, SMEs may face significant administrative burdens related to compliance and reporting. In the long-term, ongoing management of CBAM certificates and adherence to regulatory changes will require continuous effort and resources. 2. These changes may temporarily hinder SMEs ability to compete in the EU market due to increased costs and administrative requirements. However, with adequate support, SMEs can adapt and maintain their market position. 3. SMEs will need comprehensive training on the new CBAM requirements, including the use of the registry and management of certificates. Access to detailed guidelines and support from the Commission will be crucial. 4. Compliance costs are expected to rise, impacting SMEs financial performance. Additional resources will need to be allocated to manage these costs effectively. Transition Period Considerations 1. The absence of an IT tool and default values for performing and reporting calculations during the transition period will complicate the reporting process, potentially leading to errors and delays. Interim solutions or manual processes will be necessary, increasing the administrative burden. 2. Interim solutions such as simplified reporting templates, temporary financial support, and dedicated helplines would be beneficial.

        "feedback": "The draft imposes high expectations on importers without adequately addressing the differences in CBAM liabilities and environmental impacts between importers of primary CBAM goods and the much larger group of importers of downstream products. The assessment period is excessively long and the AEO-like requirements lack proportionality, especially for low-volume/value importers. Our key concerns are: 1) Compliance Program Expectations: 1a) High Costs and Disproportionate Impact: Importers of minimal downstream CBAM products are required to establish costly AEO-level compliance programs. The financial and environmental impact of low-volume imports often does not justify such rigorous compliance. While art. 11(3) leaves room to consider the low volume nature of an applicant, the open ended phrasing leaves scope for discussion and national interpretation differences. 1b) Simplifications for AEO Applicants: We recommend providing significant simplifications for importers with AEO status due to overlapping compliance infrastructure requirements. It should be avoided that national emissions authorities re-assess the adequacy of customs compliance procedures that have already been audited as part of obtaining AEO status, especially since this subject matter is outside of their field of expertise. 1c) Implementation by Authorities: Unclear how national authorities will evaluate compliance programs, particularly the use of \"expert conclusions\" and \"third-party conclusions\" (Article 4(2)). Please clarify processes (involvement of customs authorities?) and ensure conclusions are transparent and appealable. 2) Thresholds and Simplifications: The Draft deploys 2 different standards seemingly intending to distinguish between high and lower impact importers, but neither is appropriately justified and how they interact is unclear. 2a) One-Tonne (Article 13): The rationale behind the \"one-tonne\" threshold is unclear and insufficiently justified. The terminology used in the preamble about not being engaged in cross-border activity is incongruous. Also; the threshold only impacts consultation timelines, offering limited simplification for low-impact importers. 2b) Monetary Value and Volume Standard: Ambiguity in Article 13 about the one tonne \"monetary value and volume\" thresholdclarify the use of \"AND\" as well as explain what the monetary value is intended to be here, the UOM \"tonne\" does not make sense for money. We point out that monetary value and weight have no direct relationship for downstream products; a combined dual standard will be impractical. 2c) 500,000 EUR Threshold (Article 11): Lack of clear justification for the 500,000 EUR distinction between high- and low-impact importers. Its relationship to the one-tonne threshold remains unexplained. 3) Timeline Concerns: 3a) Assessment Period (120180 Days) is excessive compared to customs procedures (typically 6090 days) and is not coupled with a timeline for issuing a final decision. The extended timelines exacerbate challenges for downstream importers, particularly with CBAM scope expansions or new product introductions. New entrants may require several months to align with CBAM authorized declarant requirements; when followed by >4 months approval process this may unjustifiably interfere with business operations.",

We propose that the competent authority initiate the consultation procedure if and only with those Member States where the applicant performs activities. The mandatory consultation of all applications across the EU will be very time-consuming and administratively demanding for MS due to the number of all subjects.\nGeneral comment on the Implementing Regulation (carrying out operations in the CBAM registry)\nIt is not clear enough from the entire draft of the Implementing Regulation which operations are carried out in the CBAM registry and which operations are carried out in procedures under national law and are only registered in the CBAM registry. In view of the objective and purpose of the implementing regulation, we are in favour to address the need for as many acts as possible to be carried out (not only factually, but also legally) directly in the CBAM registry (i.e. to proceed on the basis of EU legislation, de facto excluding national legislation). We recommend that this area be properly clarified (also in the recital of the Implementing Regulation), for details see comments on individual articles. We consider this comment to be substantial.\nArticle 1 (1)\nIn the sentence “Procedures for an application to become an authorised CBAM declarant (“application”) should be carried out through the CBAM registry in electronic form”, we propose to replace “should be” by “shall”. Indeed, the Implementing Regulation establishes (shall establish) mandatory procedures, not recommended procedures, which the competent authority may or may not make use of.\nArticle 1 (3)\nIf the applicant is a legal person established in a third country, it would be appropriate, for the purposes of screening and limitation of proceedings in more than one Member State, to indicate all the countries where, according to Article 5 (31) (b) of Regulation 952/2013, the applicant is established (permanent establishments may be established in more than one EU Member State).\nArticle 2 (1)\nWe consider it necessary to add that adjustments to the submitted application must also be made through the CBAM registry. Based on the CBAM Regulation it is mandatory to submit (only) an application for authorisation through the CBAM Registry. The proposed addition aims at obliging the applicant to make adjustments to the submitted application exclusively in the CBAM registry.\nArticle 2 (4)\nWe would like to add or clarify whether the deadline is extended legally only by registration in the CBAM register or by procedures under national law (in this case, the Czech Republic would issue a formalised resolution/decision that will be registered in the CBAM register).\nArticle 2 (5)\nWe would like to request to add or clarify whether the application will be (de jure) rejected directly through the CBAM registry (e.g. by recording the rejection) or through procedures under national legislation.\nArticle 3\nArticle 3 is also intended to address the consequences of the withdrawal of an application by (legally) terminating the procedure/matters for granting the authorisation status of an authorised CBAM declarant and only recording this in the CBAM registry by the competent authority. If this were not the case, the competent authority would have to proceed according to national legislation (in the Czech Republic, this would mean that the competent authority would issue a decision to discontinue proceedings due to the withdrawal of the application and register this in the CBAM register).\nArticle 4\nA deadline of 120 days is set for the evaluation/assessment of the application. There is no deadline for issuing an authorisation (final decision). We recommend clarifying the wording if the intention was to set a deadline for issuing a decision.\nArticle 4 (3)\nWe recommend clarifying how the documentation of the assessment of compliance with the established criteria will be carried out. Will this documentation be carried out in the CBAM registry or in accordance with procedures under national law?\nArticle 4 (4)\nWe request to add or clarify whether the rejection of the decision will be issued and delivered (de jure) directly via the CBAM registry (e.g. by recording the rejection) or whether the national should be followed with the decision only be recorded in the CBAM registry. For example, it is suggested that the competent authority informs the applicant without delay, but it is not addressed how (whether through the CBAM registry).\nArticle 5 (1)\nIs the request for additional information to be made through the CBAM registry? If so, the text of the draft of the Implementing Regulation needs to be added.\nArticle 5 (2)\nHow should the competent authority inform the applicant of the extension of the deadline, through the CBAM registry (e.g. by recording) or through procedures under national law?\nArticle 6 (1)\nWe request to add or clarify whether the right to be heard (i.e. informing the applicant) will be provided through the CBAM registry or whether national legislation should be followed.\nArticle 6 (4)\nWe request to add or clarify whether the final decision will be issued directly through the CBAM registry or whether national legislation should be followed (in which case the final decision would only be recorded in the registry).\nArticle 7 (1)\nWe consider it necessary to add paragraph 1 stating that the decision on the application is delivered on the date on which the competent authority issues/registers the decision in the CBAM registry. Otherwise, national legislation must be followed.\nArticle 10 (1) point (a)\nDefinition of infringements of anti-market abuse rules is not clear. We propose a more detailed explanation of what these rules mean.\nArticle 10 (4)\nWe do not agree with the proposed rule that a competent authority shall not retain the criminal record or any similar document after a decision has been taken. The proposed rule appears to us to be inconsistent with the rules on file keeping and the obligation to document the entire procedure, e.g. for the purposes of judicial review. We consider this comment to be substantial.\nArticle 12\nWe propose that the competent authority initiate the consultation procedure only if and only with those Member States where the applicant carries out activities. The mandatory consultation of all applications across the EU will be very time-consuming and administratively demanding for MS due to the number of all entities. We consider this comment to be substantial.\nArticle 12 (2) points (b), (c) and (d)\nThese facts can and should be verified directly by the competent authority in the CBAM registry, as this is a pan-European interface and the data are objectively available. We therefore recommend deleting points (b), (c) and (d) without replacement, as this would be a bureaucratic and uneconomical\nprocedure. We consider this comment to be substantial.\nArticle 13 (2) and (3)\nGiven the scope of the conditions examined by the consulted State (with reference to Article 12 (4)) and the length of the examination of the application (120 days), the deadlines of 5 and 15 days seem very short to us. We request longer deadlines. In addition, please note that in the customs decision area, the time limit for replying to the consultation procedure is set to 45 days. We consider this comment to be substantial.\nArticle 13 (4) point (c)\nThere is an obvious mistake because item c) is not a self-standing case for extending the deadline. It should probably be part of item b).\nArticle 15 (4)\nWill the competent authority request adjustment of the guarantee through the CBAM register, or by procedures according to national legislation?\nArticle 16\nIt should be specified whether a Member State should notify the Commission every time other form of guarantee than bank guarantee is accepted (even though this form of guarantee has already been notified by this Member State) or only if a new form of guarantee is accepted in the Member State for the first time.Do we consider it necessary to clarify whether the competent authority should, in principle, notify on a one-off basis that it systematically accepts forms of guarantee other than those referred to in Article 17(5) of the Regulation (in the Czech Republic, this will be the possibility of depositing a sum of money into the account of a customs office), or should every individual case in which a different form of guarantee is accepted be notified? We consider\nthis comment to be substantial.\nArticle 17 (2)\nShould the decision to adjust the amount of the guarantee be issued in the CBAM registry or procedures according to national legislation? Article 17 (3)\nWill the request and the decision to extend the deadline be submitted/implemented through the CBAM registry or through procedures according to national legislation?\nArticle 18\nWe consider it necessary to clarify whether the decision granting the status is issued in the CBAM registry or whether it should only be available there (to be recorded/registered there once issued).\nArticle 20 (1)\nHow will the competent authority communicate to the authorised declarant the conclusions of the reassessment, through the CBAM registry or procedures according to national legislation?\nArticle 22 (1)\nA decision to revoke an authorisation is only recorded in the CBAM registry or issued directly through the CBAM registry?\nArticle 22 (7) and Article 23 (7)\nWe would like clarification in which cases a person holding a revoked authorisation may be unable to submit the declaration. We understand from the wording of the draft of implementing regulation that even a person holding a revoked authorisation still has access to the CBAM register and can therefore submit a CBAM declaration. So what does it mean that the person is unable to do so and that the CBAM declaration shall be submitted by the competent authority? For example, in the EU ETS, the operator of an installation has to submit an annual emissions report even after its emission permit has been revoked, and the competent authority only produces a conservative estimate of emissions if the operator fails to do so.\nArticle 22 (7) and Article 23 (9)\nWe recommend using the conjunction “or” instead of “and” because the paragraphs are supposed to be used alternatively not cumulatively.\nArticle 22 (8) and Article 23 (8)\nCompetent authority shall establish a CBAM declaration upon receiving the information referred to in paragraph 7 of Article 23 (quantity of goods imported from importer). What happens if the person holding a revoked authorisation does not provide this information to the competent authority? Can the competent authority establish a CBAM declaration without information from the person holding a revoked authorisation and only on the basis of e.g. import data from customs declarations and default values?\nArticle 25 (2)\nHow will immediate cancellation be reported, through the CBAM registry or through procedures under national legislation?\nArticle 26\nWe do not understand why consultation is needed when a competent authority decides to revoke an authorisation. We ask for an explanation.\nArticle 27\nIs the decision on the appeal in the CBAM registry only to be registered/recorded, or is it issued directly through the CBAM registry?\nArticle 29 (2)\nAccording to article 29 the regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and it shall apply from 31 December 2024. These dates are not realistic because the direction should be agreed on by MS on December 12th which means that it cannot be published before that date. It would mean that the regulation should apply before being in force."

        "pdf_text": "EOSCO\n20 November 2024\nPOSCO’s comments on the draft Implementing Regulation on authorising CBAM declarants\nAbout POSCO\nPOSCO, a South Korean-headquartered company, is the seventh-largest steel producer in the world and has been investing in the European Union (EU) since 1980. Our EU operations are headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, and with a presence in nine Member States, we are currently creating over 600 direct jobs in the EU and many more indirect jobs. POSCO also plays a key role in supplying high quality steel to the EU industry. We supply high-quality steel products to European automobile, home appliances and renewable energy manufacturers.\nPOSCO is actively seeking to address environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, and waste. In December 2020, POSCO became the first Asian steel making company to adopt a 2050 carbon neutrality plan. POSCO has a concrete and achievable roadmap to reach carbon neutrality, focusing on developing and deploying our breakthrough hydrogen reduction steelmaking technology (HyREX). We are investing significant amounts of resources in applying green technologies to reduce environmental impact and achieve our decarbonization goals.\nThe Republic of Korea introduced the Korea Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) in 2015. Since then, POSCO has been meticulously complying with the Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems to meet requirements under the K-ETS.\nGeneral comments\nPOSCO is fully committed to cooperating with the European Commission and relevant stakeholders for successful implementation of the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). POSCO is also strongly committed to reducing carbon emissions and is investing heavily in applying green technologies to reduce the environmental impact of its production process. It is therefore important for POSCO that the EU CBAM is implemented in a way that incentivizes the steel industry to further innovate and invest in developing breakthrough technologies to reduce carbon emissions and reward steel producers who provide high-quality and clean steel products to the EU.\nIt is central to the functioning of the CBAM (and of the EU ETS) that imported goods should only be allowed on the EU market after the right amount of CBAM certificates have been purchased, and ultimately released. It would be very harmful to EU industries and third country operators who significantly invested in clean technology if goods are allowed to enter the EU market, without the purchase and release of CBAM certificates commensurate to the actual emissions.\nIn our view, there is a significant risk that this could happen, if CBAM declarants are not sufficiently screened and controlled, and are allowed to make imports of CBAM goods for extended periods of time with emissions declaration that are lower than default values but without having received solid data from third country operators. In effect, CBAM declarants will never, or almost never have access to the data, or have the skills necessary, to determine on their own whether actual emissions were calculated accurately. The only way for CBAM declarants to have any chance to be accurate about emissions lower than default values is if they receive emission data that comes from third\ncountry operators that have registered on the CBAM registry and submitted third-party verification report.\nAs explained below, POSCO expresses its view on the draft Implementing Regulation (IR) concerning the authorization of CBAM declarants:\n1) applicants for an authorized CBAM declarant must be encouraged to import CBAM goods from third country operators who will register on the CBAM Registry in accordance with Article 14 of the CBAM Regulation, submit emissions data, and share emissions data securely with declarants; and 2) a long assessment period on application for authorization of up to 180 days is excessively long and could hinder the timely authorization of CBAM declarants and unduly restrict imports of CBAM goods.\nPOSCO appreciates the opportunity to express its views and we respectfully request the Commission to consider the following suggestions for further revision and clarification.\n1 Encouraging import of CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered on the CBAM Registry\nApplicants for an authorized CBAM declarant must be encouraged to import CBAM goods from third country operators who will register to the CBAM Registry in accordance with Article 14 of the CBAM Regulation’, upload installation data, submit emissions data, and share emissions data securely with declarants. In our view, operators in third countries who register and provide verified emission data via the CBAM Registry will be a lot more trustworthy in terms of quality of emission data and likely to provide clean steel products because they are confident enough to share the information directly with the Commission and have subjected their emission data to verifications by independent accredited verifiers.\nThis will benefit relevant stakeholders as follows:\nThird country operators can provide confidential elements of emission data directly to the European Commission and national competent authorities of EU Member States via the CBAM Registry. Authorized CBAM declarants can rely on trustworthy emission data directly provided by third country operators and use it for submitting CBAM declarations. They won’t need to receive commercially sensitive information for the purpose of preparing their declarations. The more third operators register via the CBAM Registry and directly provide emission data, the easier it will be for authorized CBAM declarants to comply with the CBAM. This would also increase the reliability of emission data, helping the Commission and the national authorities in ensuring that the CBAM is successfully implemented and complied with.\nRegulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism, OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 52-104\n-2-\nTo clarify, there is currently no obligation, no incentive even, under the CBAM Regulation for EU importers to make best efforts to import CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry. Thus, the draft IR does not directly include any wording on this.\nAt the same time, we note that the draft IR provides in recital (10) that “to ensure that only bona fide importers become authorized CBAM declarants, the competent authorities should make sure that the applicant has not been involved in a serious or repeated infringement of legislation including economic criminal offences, and that it has a good financial rating” and provides detailed rules on criteria for granting the status of authorized CBAM declarant in Article 10 (serious or repeated infringements) and Article 11 (conditions for financial and operational capacity).\nWe suggest the Commission to add the following wording as Article 11.1(e):2\nThe applicant agrees to import CBAM goods made by third country operators that have registered with the CBAM Registry in accordance with Article 14 of the CBAM Regulation, whenever possible. The applicant will be made aware of the risks associated with using emission data from third country operators that have not registered on the CBAM Registry. When such data is used, they will be required to demonstrate that they have put in place the additional due diligence and data quality controls necessary to ensure that the emission data received and submitted is accurate.\nFurther, when the competent authority determines the revocation of the status of authorized CBAM declarants in accordance with Article 23 of the draft IR, the competent authority could consider the fact that that the authorized CBAM declarants made use of third country operators registered in the CBAM Registry as an indication of good faith to comply with CBAM obligations.\nIn our view, this will encourage authorized CBAM declarants to import CBAM goods from third country operators who will register to the CBAM Registry and, thus, contribute to the successful implementation of the CBAM.\n2. Excessively long period for the assessment of applications for authorization\nArticle 4 (assessment of the application by the competent authority) and Article 5 (request for additional information by the competent authority) of the draft IR provides an assessment period of 120 days for reviewing applications submitted by EU-based importers, which can be extended to\n? Article 11.1 of the draft IR provides “The criteria laid down in Article 17(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 shall be fulfilled where the following conditions are met:\n(a) the applicant is not subject to bankruptcy proceedings;\n(b) the applicant is not in arrears with the payment of customs duties, taxes or charges which are collected on or in connection with the import of goods, financial regulatory obligations and all other duties related to its economic activity;\n(c) the applicant demonstrates, on the basis of supporting documents provided together with the application, a sufficient financial standing to meet its obligations and fulfil commitments having regard to the type and volume of the economic activity performed by indicating the financial figures and any other financial information;\n(d) the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for fulfilment of the estimated obligations to surrender CBAM certificates, and has internal controls capable of preventing, detecting and correcting errors in CBAM declarations and CBAM certificates management, and of preventing and detecting illegal or any irregular transactions.\n-3-\n180 days if additional information is required. This period is excessively long and could hinder the timely authorization of CBAM declarants and unduly hinder imports of CBAM goods.\nTo ensure compliance with CBAM obligations starting in January 2026, most importers will seek to obtain the status of CBAM declarants in advance. However, in certain circumstances, that will not be possible. For instance, if the distribution channel of importing CBAM goods unexpectedly changes during the definitive period, resulting in a change in the role of the CBAM declarant, imports could be restricted for up to 180 days, while the competent authority reviews the new application.\nIf the importation of CBAM goods is restricted due to CBAM obligations, the CBAM would de facto be a “disguised restriction on international trade” and create “arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination” against imported goods. Further, this restriction goes against the minimizing administrative burden, which is explicitly provided in recitals 3 and 12 of the draft IR.?\nTo ensure smooth authorization procedures for both importers and competent authorities, we request the Commission to consider the following:\n(1) Minimize the assessment period as much as possible (e.g., 60 days for reviewing applications and 90 days if additional information is required); (2) Implement a fast-track authorization procedure for declarants who have diligently fulfilled their reporting obligations during the transitional period; and (3) Allow the importation of CBAM goods by an applicant that has not yet been authorized if the assessment period exceeds 120 days, to safeguard conventional trade flows. This could be subject to the requirement to regularize the situation once the authorization decision has been made: if the decision is positive, by the applicant; or if it is negative, by another authorized CBAM declarant.\nIn our view, these measures will facilitate a more efficient and smooth authorization procedures, ensuring that importers can meet their CBAM obligations without unnecessarily delay or restrict the importation of CBAM goods.\n%* OK\n3 Recital (3) provides “the Commission is to adopt implementing rules for the submission of the application and for the authorisation procedure, duly considering the need to minimize administrative burden, through automation of procedures and self-declaration of information to the extent possible.” Further, recital (12) provides “to ensure a proportionate application of the procedures, the competent authorities may, in their evaluation of the criteria for granting an authorisation, consider the specific characteristics of the applicant, and in particular micro, small and medium- sized enterprises that should not be subject to unnecessary administrative burden.”\n-4-"

        "feedback": "The draft CBAM regulation raises several important concerns regarding clarity and practical implementation. One notable issue is the ambiguity surrounding the one-tonne threshold mentioned in the recital. The claim that importers of less than one tonne are \"not engaging in cross-border activity\" appears contradictory, as the act of importing inherently involves cross-border transactions. Further clarification is needed to explain this assertion and the rationale behind the threshold. Additionally, if this is intended to serve as a de minimis threshold for CBAM obligations, this should be explicitly stated and justified, given the relatively low financial impact of such imports. Another area of concern is the inconsistency between Article 9(2) and Article 21. While the former states that a CBAM account will remain closed for five years following revocation, the latter permits declarants to reapply for authorisation at any time. These provisions seem contradictory and require alignment to avoid confusion for businesses navigating these procedures. The regulation also introduces financial and administrative requirements for applicants, yet these lack detailed criteria. Article 11, for instance, mandates that companies demonstrate sufficient financial standing and have a suitable administrative organisation for compliance. However, the absence of clear standards leaves room for subjective interpretation, potentially disadvantaging smaller companies or those with streamlined operations. For example, companies importing large volumes of CBAM goods but operating with a small workforce may struggle to meet unclear expectations about administrative organisation. One solution could be to allow companies to externalise parts of the process, such as administrative oversight or compliance verification, to specialised third-party entities. This approach would ensure that companies, regardless of size, can meet CBAM requirements while focusing their internal resources on core operations. Similarly, the requirement for financial audits when obligations exceed EUR 500,000 (as outlined in Article 11.4) is vague, with the phrase \"where applicable\" needing more precise definition to ensure consistency. Furthermore, the treatment of non-compliance during the CBAM transitional period raises questions. While the regulation considers past infringements in the authorisation process, it does not clarify how transitional infractions, often resulting from initial uncertainties, will be weighed. A more explicit approach is necessary to ensure fairness for companies still adapting to these complex requirements.",

The EU would need to define uniform criteria for when financial stability exists and what an organisation must be for compliance with the CBAM process. I think these requirements are superfluous. If the CBAM declarant is already required to purchase CO2 certificates on a quarterly basis, this is proof of financial strength. The verification of the CBAM declaration with verification by accredited verifiers should be sufficient. Article 11(4) requires the submission of the annual audit report where the value of the certificate exceeds EUR 500. It makes more sense to require the submission of the audit report in any case for medium-sized and larger companies. These companies are subject to audit and the annual accounts, accompanied by the auditor’s audit report, are published.

Furthermore, Articles 5 and 11 emphasize financial solidity and the need for declarants to forecast their import values precisely, yet there is no clear mechanism for cost determination, and default values remain unavailable. This absence creates uncertainty for declarants trying to comply with the financial requirements. Additionally, the regulation does not mention Third Party Verification, which is critical for ensuring compliance, especially given the strict provisions in Articles 21 and 23 on the revocation of status.

Doesnt the fact that these companies import goods mean that they engage in cross border activity? ---- One tonne seems to have been deemed a relevant threshold value, according to the point above, as well as the timelines specified for the consultation periods in Article 13. ---- Its unclear from this document how this threshold will be used. It seems to be a low threshold, considering the corresponding CBAM obligation would still be under EUR 300 per year. Is the Commission considering using this value as a potential new de minimis threshold? - Article 9(2) says that when a CBAM authorisation is revoked, the CBAM account will hold the status of closed for five years after the revocation. Article 21 says that a declarant whose authorisation has been revoked may reapply for an authorisation at any time. These two points sound contradictory. How can they re-apply if their CBAM account is to remain closed for 5 years? Could the Commission provide more clarity on this point? - Article 11.1 (c) requires the applicant to demonstrate that it has the financial capacity to comply with the regulation by reviewing their financial information. What specific criteria shall be used by NCAs to decide this? - Article 11.1 (d) requires that the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for the fulfilment of the CBAM obligations. There are companies that import high volumes of CBAM goods, but have a small number of employees. What specific criteria will be used by the NCA to decide on this? - Article 11.4 says that if the estimated annual CBAM obligation is greater than EUR 500,000, the competent authority shall request the financial statement audit report, where applicable. When is this applicable? - The criteria for granting a CBAM declarant authorisation mentions infringement of customs regulations, and this regulation. How will non-compliance during the Transitional Period of CBAM factor into this decision process?",

        "feedback": "Hello, I have been corridnating the CBAM reporting of my company since the application of the law and here are my feedbacks : 1. Communication channel between the commission and companies. Communication is not active enough. Mails should be sent out, or alerts, warning companies for any updates made on the portal or any new requirements. On my side, I keep digging in the commission's website to actually understand what is new. I discover docuements have been updated because I look into these docuements and note differences. 2. Indirect emissions calculation. This has been a big question mark on our side. Thinking our suppliers would need to calculate their own emissions, we trained them on the latter, built an internal simplified excel for the ones not responding (too small entities). We were very surprised during Q3 2024 reporting, the emissions were actually calculated automatically. You only ask for electricty consumption, energy source etc. Don't get me wrong this makes the process easier but we thought it would be way more detailed (also based on the excel the commision provided that was extremely complex). 3. Steps forward : we keep discovering things when reporting which makes a lot of stress and forth and back for us (central management of all our sites that do the reporting themselves). For instance, I've heard there would be a new status needed by 2025 (CBAM declarant status). Is this new ? How do we do ? We'd like to be ready. 4. CBAM portal : as of now the portal seems to have been updated. You are obviously not without know how difficult the processes were at the start. This should not happen in the official rollout of such a regulation. How can companies be motivated to actually fulfil and support these obligations of the process is such a hassle ? I hope these feedbacks can help. Best regards, Jeanne Parmentier",

One idea that I believe should be explored is to provide a simplified authorisation route for applicants as CBAM declarants which are also AEO certified. For example, the solvability criteria could be deemed to be fulfilled, together with the lack of serious infringements. This simplified access route is widely accepted across different type of authorisations required by the Union Customs Code, where some of the conditions are considered to be fulfilled by AEO certified companies. Going forward, it may be worth to offer discounts in the guarantee level required for CBAM declarants which are also AEO. For example, under Union Customs Code, AEO companies benefit of 30%, 70% or even 100% discounts in guarantee amounts required. This way of bringing together AEO with CBAM would increase the value of the AEO across the EU and would stimulate more companies to apply for the AEO status.",

An elabora- tion of the individual points can be found in the following cor- responding paragraphs.\n1) Interoperable systems and automated data transfer: The CBAM registry should be interoperable with existing IT sys- tems to minimize the administrative burden and ensure au- tomated data transfer while maintaining data protection. 2) CBAM Business continuity plan: A CBAM business continu- ity plan is essential and should be made available as soon as the CBAM registry is accessible. 3) Delegation of access to CBAM registry: Clarification is needed on the delegation of access to the CBAM registry for revoked declarants, including who can act on their behalf. 4) Operators request and documentation requirements: The requirement for operators to request and document access to the CBAM portal should be carefully considered to avoid creating unnecessary administrative hurdles. 5) Clarifications on financial and customs procedures: Clarifi- cation is needed on whether non-EU importers can use fi- nancial representation and if CBAM goods can be stored in customs warehouses while declarant approval is pending. 6) Storage and calculations of CBAM obligations: Clear rules are needed on whether CBAM goods can be stored in cus- toms warehouses if the importer is not an authorized de- clarant, and more transparency is required on the calcula- tion of CBAM obligations and penalties. 7) Training, support and guidelines: Adequate resources should be allocated to develop detailed guides, support, and training to avoid technical issues and ensure smooth implementation, including providing companies access to a test environment before going live.\nSagsnr.:\n1 Interoperable systems and automated data transfer Following the wording of point (4) and (9) in the recital, we strongly support the notion that the CBAM registry should be interoperable with existing customs systems and in general ex- isting IT-systems. As CBAM is already an added administrative burden especially on SME’s, it is important to ensure that the CBAM registry does not add to this. Thus, in order to lessen the administrative burden as much as possible on EU companies, it is important that the dataflow across existing and new IT-sys- tems are as smooth as possible. Additionally, it would be bene- ficial if as much data as possible is transferred amongst IT-sys- tems in an automated way, whilst ensuring data protection.\n2 CBAM business continuity plan\nThe notion of developing a CBAM business continuity plan, as presented in point (12) in the recital, is important to ensure that all actors are aware of alternate solutions. To this end, it would be beneficial if this business continuity plan is made available as soon as the CBAM registry is made accessible.\n3 Delegation of access to CBAM registry In art. 8, it is stated that CBAM declarants for whom the status of CBAM declarant was revoked, may delegate access to the CBAM registry to persons acting on their behalf (art. 8(6)). \\t is unclear as to what this delegation of access entails and who can act on a revoked CBAM declarants behalf. Thus, clarity to this point is needed, and whether the person who access is dele- gated to, must also be authorized as CBAM declarant.\n4 Operators request and documentation requirements In art. 9, it is stated that an operator shall submit a request to the Commission to be assigned a profile to obtain access to the CBAM portal, accompanied by documentation. As CBAM im- porters are already struggling to gather data from suppliers, it seems like an unnecessary administrative hurdle to have to re- quest and document in order to get access to the CBAM portal as an operator. This point should be carefully considered, in or- der to make ensure that suppliers are not discouraged from ac- cessing the registry due to this.\n5 Clarifications on financial and customs procedures Art. 8 allows authorized CBAM declarants to grant access to oth- ers acting on their behalf, raising questions about whether im- porters not established in the EU can rely on financial represen- tation through tax-registered entities. Clarifying this aspect is\ncrucial to support administrative flexibility, especially for DPP deliveries. Additionally, art. 5 and art. 9 discuss the integration of customs systems and the process for becoming an authorized declarant but do not specify whether CBAM goods can be im- ported to customs warehouses while the declarant's approval is pending. Explicit guidance on these scenarios would help streamline import operations and reduce uncertainty.\n6 Storage and calculation of CBAM obligations Art. 3 and 5 establish the CBAM registry’s functions and its in- teroperability with customs systems to facilitate handling of goods and ensure compliance. However, they do not address whether CBAM goods can be stored in customs warehouses if the importer is not an authorised declarant, particularly for goods exempt from VAT and duties. Clear rules on this point would provide legal certainty for importers. Furthermore, art. 3 and art. 14 describe the registry's role in calculating CBAM obligations and penalties but lack detail on the specific cases in which the system determines financial liabilities and fines. Greater transparency on these processes is essential to ensure compliance and fairness.\n7 Training, support and guidelines Following the experiences derived from the implementation of the transitional registry, it is important that the implementa- tion of the CBAM registry does not encounter the same tech- nical issues when going live. Additionally, it would be benefi- cial to grant companies access to a test-environment of the system, before going live, in order to identify any issues or un- clarities within the system. On a general note, it is highly rec- ommended to allocate adequate resources to both develop detailed guides for using the registry, as well as support and training for both declarants and suppliers when phasing in the CBAM registry."

To secure a best possible base for such assessment a collection of import and re-export information is vital. However, considering the diversified nature of Customs systems it is essential to allow for alternative methods of conveying such data to the Commission and the CBAM registry other than the Surveillance system, until common solutions are found for all CBAM reporting countries. Norwegian Customs therefore supports the possibility to use alternative ways to report the CBAM data as suggested in the proposals preamble number 10 and in article 5 no 1 (g): the CBAM Transitional Registry as referred to in Article 10 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773.",

For operations involving multiple traders in the chain, the system should require the registration of all traders in the chain. The system should include a value simulator that can provide emission data for the operators involved. The CBAM should be the official source of emissions for transactions conducted with the EU, aiming to reduce the reporting burden on operators. The obligation to report emission data in the CBAM should be annual for those operators who only calculate emissions once a year. Deadlines for data updates, declarations, record validity, or other relevant milestones in the system should be systematically notified to declarants and operators via electronic messages sent to previously registered email addresses, with 60, 30, 15, and 10 days' notice. The CBAM should have its mapping of accredited verifiers available in regions other than the EU. The approval period for the registrar (120 days is too long) should be reduced, or at least an emergency procedure should be created. There is a need to develop regulations for the financial guarantees required to cover CBAM certificates. Additionally, non-financial guarantees should be accepted. Simplification of forms with the possibility of cross-authorization between registrars so that one can use the information of the other, if it makes sense. Creation of a transparency portal where registrars can monitor their processes and third parties can monitor the registrants to provide a minimum level of security for process participants who are not importers. There is a need to open specific regulations for users outside the EU, as the system will be interchangeable with other EU customs systems.",

        "feedback": "In 2026, CBAM will start real operations. Only registered CBAM declarants can then declare the goods concerned in the customs territory of the EU and allow their import. It is very essential that such a complex reporting obligation as the CBAM has a well-functioning technical reporting tool. The user-friendliness of the portal must be ensured. In particular, experience with the transitional register shall be taken into account. There should be extensive testing possibilities before the start of real-life operations. We would ask you to check whether the new register meets all the requirements that are important for the companies. We have listed them below. The requirements for the CBAM registry from a business perspective are the following (choice): The CBAM registry should be made available in all official languages of the EU. There should be a functional overview version to report data without registration. The error messages should be easy to understand in order to speed up the preparation and submission of CBAM reports. Explanations for input fields should support and simplify the completion. The customs data of the imported CBAM items per importer should be made available directly in the registry based on its EORI number. For this purpose, import data should be made available in advance by the customs administration. The reporting entity then checks, corrects and supplements them, not only after the CBAM report has been uploaded. This would also help to ensure that companies submit full CBAM reports. It is necessary to introduce a practical de minimis rule for small consignments. This can be based on weight, e.g. one tonne or value. For example, for the CBAM system in Great Britain, the de minimis threshold is 50.000 pounds. When entering the data, it should be clear to users whether data has been stored on positions in the system. It should be ensured that data that have been accidentally deleted can be restored. It should be possible to temporarily store data in the system. In the event of system overload or failure, there should be a message on the system side as soon as the system is again stable and further data entry is possible again. It must be possible for companies to download CBAM reports. A system to system connection must be guaranteed so that, in the case of high volumes, individual information is not required. An Excel upload is not sufficient. The Excel upload should be simplified so that evaluations from the well-known customs software applications can easily be completed and fed into. The register should allow for centralised reporting for several parts of the undertaking or sister companies. Unitary CBAM reporting (a CBAM decorator for several parts of the company, subsidiaries, etc.) would in part significantly reduce the administrative burden for larger companies or business groupings. This must also be possible across Member States. At the same time, for representatives of several other undertakings (e.g. Customs service providers) are able to provide information per company represented in order not to be cumbersome to maintain this at position level. A separate report per company represented would then also be possible. The report currently drawn up in the transitional register contains the information of all the companies represented, so that it cannot be handed over to the representatives under data protection law.",

        "feedback": "We welcome the European Commissions efforts to develop a framework for the CBAM registry. Nevertheless, certain provisions in the draft Implementing Regulation require revision to improve clarity, operational coherence, and alignment with established frameworks. Firstly, Article 4(2) introduces ambiguity by implying that both the competent authority and other entities may be responsible for communicating decisions on penalties. This phrasing conflicts with Article 26(4) of the CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956, which assigns this responsibility solely to the competent authority. To address this, we recommend amending Article 4(2) to clarify that only the competent authority is responsible for communicating penalty decisions. Secondly, Article 10, which governs the CBAM Operators Portal, requires several clarifications: 1. The article does not explicitly state that the portal applies to operators of installations in third countries, potentially leading to confusion. To resolve this, the text should clearly specify its scope. 2. The phrasing of Article 10(2)(b) allows for potential misinterpretation that operators can register information on goods from installations other than their own. We suggest revising this to specify information on the goods produced by its installation. 3. The draft does not indicate whether the use of the portal is voluntary, leaving operators uncertain about compliance requirements. We recommend explicitly stating that the portals use is voluntary, ensuring flexibility. Next, Article 16 refers to a business continuity plan to address temporary registry failures but provides no details or definitions. This omission leaves stakeholders uninformed about its content or application. To enhance transparency, the legal text should either define the term or outline its components. Furthermore, Article 21 on the confidentiality of data within the CBAM registry raises concerns about transparency and consistency with the EU ETS framework. The CBAM framework designates most registry information as confidential, restricting public access to key data and undermining accountability. In contrast, the ETS Registry, referencing Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, provides transparency through publicly available data on installations, emissions, and free allocations. The CBAM Regulation itself (Article 1(2)) emphasises the need for equivalence with ETS rules. To align with these principles, we recommend: 1. Clearly defining personal data and specifying what information is accessible to authorised CBAM declarants, operators, and other actors. 2. Revising Article 21 to reflect the transparency standards of the ETS Registry, with a reference to Directive 2003/4/EC. 3. Publishing key information, such as contact details of declarants and operators, as well as total emissions and CBAM certificates. Finally, Article 23(1) stipulates a 10-year data retention period, which exceeds the 5-year limit set by Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 during the transitional period. To ensure consistency, we recommend aligning the CBAM registrys data retention period with this 5-year standard. These adjustments will ensure the CBAM registry operates transparently, efficiently, and in harmony with existing regulatory frameworks.

However, the draft text raises several concerns regarding legal clarity, transparency, and operational coherence. This paper outlines critical issues in the draft Regulation and proposes recommendations to address them.\n“competent authority” and the “person other than an authorised CBAM declarant (...)” are responsible for communicating the decisions on penalties. The purpose of Article 4(2) should be to attach the responsibility for communicating the decisions on penalties solely to the competent authority and not to other entities, therefore it should be amended to reflect this.\nRecommendation:\nAmend Article 4(2) to assign sole responsibility for communicating the decisions on penalties to the competent authority. Suggested wording:\n“The competent authority of the Member State of establishment of the authorised CBAM declarant, or of a person other than an authorised CBAM declarant...”\nThis ensures alignment with Article 26(4) of CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956 and eliminates potential misinterpretations.\n2. Legal Clarity in Article 10 -CBAM Operators Portal\na Scope of the Portal: Article 10 on ‘CBAM Operators Portal’ does not explicitly state that the portal is intended for operators of installations in third countries, potentially causing confusion.\nRecommendation:\nClarify Article 10 by explicitly specifying that the portal applies to operators of installations in third countries, ensuring consistency with the scope of Article 10 of the CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nb. Ambiguity in Data Registration: Article 10(2)(b) states that operators can register “information on the goods produced by an installation,” which could lead to the misinterpretation that operators will be allowed to register information on goods produced by installations other than their own.\nRecommendation:\nRevise the wording in Article 10(2)(b), by replacing “information on the goods produced by an installation” with “information on the goods produced by as its installation”.\nc. Voluntary Nature of the CBAM Operators Portal: The draft Regulation does not clarify whether the use of the CBAM Operators Portal is mandatory for operators.\nRecommendation:\nExplicitly state in Article 10 that the use of the CBAM Operators Portal is voluntary, providing operators with flexibility in their compliance approaches.\n3. Defining “Business Continuity Plan”\nArticle 16 on the ‘Temporary failure of the CBAM registry’ refers to a “business continuity plan”, laying down the means that must be followed by CBAM declarants and applicants in the event of a temporary failure of the CBAM registry. However, the article fails to provide further details or definitions nor is this tool referred to in the CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956, leaving stakeholders uninformed.\nRecommendation:\nFor transparency purposes, and to guarantee an adequately informed public consultation process, the Commission should provide further details about the “business continuity plan”, either by defining it or by properly explaining what the business continuity plan will consist of in the legal text.\n4. Balance Between Data Confidentiality, Data Sharing, and Transparency\nArticle 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation addresses the confidentiality of information in the registry but introduces ambiguities. It allows CBAM declarants to access certain types of personal data but lacks clarity on what constitutes “personal data” and the specific data accessible to different actors in the CBAM ecosystem. Furthermore, the CBAM Registry does not ensure the same level of transparency as the EU ETS Registry, potentially undermining public accountability and scrutiny.\nThe ETS Registry Regulation (2019/1122) provides a robust example of transparency, offering public access to critical information such as contact details of installations, total emissions, and free allocations. This is based on the reference to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. In contrast, the CBAM Registry framework largely designates all information as confidential, with limited data sharing and only an annual Commission report on the total aggregated emissions by CBAM goods.\nIt should be considered that Article 1(2) of the CBAM Regulation describes CBAM as a framework that, in relation to the ETS, applies “an equivalent set of rules to imports into the customs territory of the Union of the goods referred to in Article 2” of the CBAM Regulation. Therefore, secondary legislation mandated by the\nWY\nPage | 2 iw\nCBAM Regulation —such as the CBAM Registry Regulation— must follow this legal setting to the greatest extent possible by adequately mirroring ETS provisions such as those established in the ETS Registry Regulation 2019/1122.\nRecommendations:\n1 Clarify Definitions and Data Access e Clearly define “personal data” in the CBAM context, specifying what information is accessible to authorised CBAM declarants, operators, and other actors. e Provide detailed descriptions of the data types available within each of the five CBAM registry portals to avoid confusion. 2 Enhance Transparency e Revise Article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation (and Article 14 of the CBAM Regulation) to align with the high transparency standards of the ETS Registry, by including a reference to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. e Publish key information publicly, such as: [e) Contact details of CBAM declarants and third-country operators. o Total emissions and CBAM certificates for each declarant. 3 Ensure Legal and Operational Alignment e Align Article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation with Article 1(2) of the CBAM Regulation, which mandates equivalency with the ETS framework. This entails mirroring ETS provisions such as those in Regulation 2019/1122, particularly on data access and transparency protocols.\n5. Data Retention Period in Article 23 (1)\nThe data retention period of 10 years under Article 23 (1) exceeds the maximum of 5 years established in Implementing Regulation on CBAM reporting obligations during the transitional period (EU 2023/1773).\nRecommendation:\nAlign the data retention period for the CBAM registry with the 5-year limit specified in Article 38 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1773.\nWY\nPage | 3 iw\nFor further information:\nHere our answer to the European Commission study on the CBAM scope extension to downstream products (July 2024) Here our letter to DG TAXUD on CBAM double reporting and taxation concerns (February 2024) Here our position paper on the Draft Implementing Regulation on Reporting Obligations during the transitional period (July 2023) Here our memo on the methodology for indirect emissions in CBAM (May 2023) Here our Position Paper on why alumina should not be included in CBAM (November 2022) Here CRU External Study “Assessment of European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Regulation” for European Aluminium (May 2022) Here our detailed position paper on the proposed CBAM (October 2021) 1 pager on why a CBAM on indirect emission will increase global emissions (June 2022) 1 pager on why indirect emissions in CBAM will harm European production (October 2021) e Here our non-paper CBAM and excise duty tax design (February 2021)\nFor more information on European Aluminium’s work on CBAM, all papers, external studies and memos are available at the “Climate & Energy Section on our Website under “CBAM”.\nEmanuele Manigrassi Director, Climate Change & Energy M +32 471 73 53 06 manigrassi@european-aluminium.eu\nLorraine Schréter Climate & Energy Policy Assistant M +32 499 65 12 77 schroeter@european-aluminium.eu\nA\nEuropean =\nAluminium\nOZ\nPage 14 iw"

Suppliers from the USA do not have such information and do not receive it from producers as carbon calculations involve additional financial outlay (costs of hiring additional staff, outsourcing, installation of metering equipment) and responsibilities. - Complicated carbon footprint calculations - cumbersome, labor-intensive and difficult to perform. - Compliance with EU regulations and registration on the CBAM portal by operators and companies with installations in the US raises concerns over implementation. - Suppliers do not want to share information about their subcontractors and manufacturers. - The inability to find alternatives to suppliers of US-origin goods, which are certified according to standards that mainly operate in the US (e.g. AWS for welding, AS, etc.). These suppliers know that they are a scarce source for obtaining such goods and will not comply with regulations of countries outside the US. - The inability to find alternatives to suppliers of US-origin goods, which must be purchased for government projects based on FAR or DFAR requirements. Suppliers supplying goods under these regulations will not be aligned with the regulations of countries outside the US. Proposal for discussion in future: - The creation of viable and simple to operate exemptions from CBAM reporting of third country deliveries of goods intended for the production of military equipment and armaments used for EU and NATO member states. - Creation of default coefficients for CBAM reportable commodities to be used when actual data cannot be obtained.",

While preserving the confidentiality of business sensitive information, a high degree of transparency of the CBAM Registry is indispensable for public scrutiny and input, which can lead to more robust and well-considered policies.\nAgainst this background, the signatories of this paper would like to highlight their serious concerns about the expected level of intransparency of the CBAM Registry, especially when compared with the EU ETS Registry. This is due to combination of the provisions of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as those of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956.\nAccording to the current CBAM legal framework (in particular article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956), de facto all information in the CBAM Registry will be deemed as confidential. The Commission would publish only an annual report on total aggregated emissions by CBAM good.\nOn the contrary, the EU ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013 (Annex IX) provides public access to most of the relevant information included in the registry, such as contact details of European installations as well as details on total emissions and free allocation for each installation. This high level of transparency is linked to the explicit reference of recital 28 of the ETS Registry Regulation to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. Instead, no reference to the same legislation is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation.\nAgainst this background, the signatories urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as reviewing the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation in the context of the 2025 revision in order to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry. For instance, such consistency requires that contact details of CBAM declarants and third country operators as well as total emissions and total available CBAM certificates for each of them are made publicly accessible.\nAnnex: legal references\nArticle 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956\n1 The Commission shall establish a CBAM registry of authorised CBAM declarants in the form of a standardised electronic database containing the data regarding the CBAM certificates of those authorised CBAM declarants.

An operator may choose not to have its name, address and contact information made accessible to the public. The public information in the CBAM registry shall be made accessible by the Commission in an interoperable format.\nas 2 The Commission shall publish, on a yearly basis, for each of the goods listed in Annex I, the aggregated emissions embedded in the imported goods.\n6 The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the infrastructure and specific processes and procedures of the CBAM registry, including the risk analysis referred to in Article 15, the electronic databases containing the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the data of the accounts in the CBAM registry referred to in Article 16, the transmission to the CBAM registry of the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CRAM certificates referred to in Article 20, and the cross-check of information referred to in Article 25(3). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2).\nArticle 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation\nArticle 2]\nLimitation of data access, data processing and confidentiality\nAll information held in the CBAM registry shall be considered confidential.

It is unclear if the framework will permit fiscal representation where the party wishing to import CBAM goods is not authorised to import. Usually, importers who are not established in the EU can have a tax registered company to act on their behalf for administrative obligations and managing VAT affairs while dealing with the tax authorities. It should be clarified if this is possible when it comes to CBAM, as this will facilitate, among other things, DPP shipments of CBAM goods. It should also be clarified, if goods can be imported into a bonded warehouse pending authorisation of the importer. In the event of an importer not being an authorised CBAM declarant, will the regulations allow for storage of CBAM goods in a bonded warehouse? Especially if such goods are not subject to VAT and customs. In which case will the system be able to compute the penal sum based financial obligation for CBAM that is due? We remain available for discussion in case of further questions. Please do not hesitate to contact Andreas Ermler at aerml@orsted.com",

        "pdf_text": "27 November 2024, Brussels\nBaker Hughes’ response to the European Commission’s consultation on the implementing regulations as regards the conditions and procedures related to the status of authorised CBAM declarant and the CBAM registry.\nIntroduction\nBaker Hughes is a leading energy technology company that provides solutions for energy and industrial customers worldwide. We design, manufacture, and service transformative technologies to help take energy forward —- making it safer, cleaner, and more efficient for the people and the planet. While we operate globally, Europe is a key market and corporate home for Baker Hughes. Across the EU, Norway and the UK, Baker Hughes employs approximately 17,000 people in engineering, manufacturing, and research and development roles.\nBaker Hughes supports the Paris Agreement objectives and the energy and climate goals set out by the European Union. We believe that climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing the world and warrants meaningful action to reduce the environmental impact. In this context, we see the greatest potential in hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) and technologies aimed at emissions abatement. Many of our products (e.g., turbines, compressors, valves, pumps, drilling equipment) are manufactured across the European Economic Area (EEA) and exported globally, contributing positively to the trade balance in a number of Member States. Our products and services are provided to thousands of customers across countries in the EEA in a wide range of industrial sectors and generate billions in revenues'. To develop our products in the EU, we rely on global supply chains purchasing materials and various elements from around the world.\nHaving gained valuable insights during the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) reporting cycle, we would like to share our observations and recommendations in relation to the\nBaker Hughes $3\n' Baker Hughes 10-K Report submitted in February 2024, available here.\nPAGE |1\nBaker Hughes $3\nupcoming supplementary CBAM legislation. Additionally, we have provided comments on the future legislative steps regarding the requirements and the expansion of the EU CBAM.\nRecommendation: Clarify requirements related to guarantees.\nChapter Il of the draft Regulation outlines the conditions and procedures related to the status of an authorised CBAM declarant, including the requirement to register a guarantee in the CBAM registry. This guarantee is intended to cover the number of CBAM certificates that the declarant will be required to purchase in order to cover the carbon emissions embedded in imported goods. According to the draft Regulation, the amount of the guarantee will be determined by the competent authorities and is intended to ensure that companies have sufficient financial capacity to meet their CBAM obligations.\nWhile the draft Regulation provides detailed provisions on registering and adjusting guarantees, there remains an important question regarding whether companies are required to establish new guarantees specifically for CBAM or if existing guarantees (e.g., bank guarantees already in place for VAT or customs) can be used to meet these new obligations. At present, many companies already have bank guarantees which are common requirements in international trade. Given the similarities in financial guarantees for VAT and customs obligations, there is a question as to whether these existing guarantees can be used to satisfy the new CBAM requirements, or if companies will be expected to open entirely new guarantees.\nIn light of the above considerations, we recommend that the European Commission clarifies\nwhether companies are required to establish new bank guarantees solely for CBAM compliance or if existing guarantees (e.g., for VAT or customs) can be adjusted or repurposed to meet CBAM requirements.\nRecommendation: Ensure smooth submission of data via the CBAM registry.\nAs a truly European company with numerous legal entities across various EU countries, we are currently required to manage a separate Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) for each of our entities that need to comply with the CBAM requirements. This necessitates\nPAGE | 2\nBaker Hughes $3\nthe appointment of a declarant with access to the CBAM transitional registry for each legal entity, meaning we need around 30 trained staff members to ensure compliance with CBAM requirements across our operations.\nAt present, this situation is resource- and time-intensive, placing a significant administrative burden on our teams. To streamline this process and improve operational efficiency, we\nrecommend introducing the option to allocate multiple EORIs to one declarant within the permanent CBAM registry.\nBy centralizing the process and appointing fewer declarants, we believe companies could simplify internal workflows, enhance the effectiveness of data collection, and ensure stronger governance to comply with the CBAM requirements. This approach would ultimately reduce the administrative load while maintaining the integrity of the regulatory framework.\nRecommendations for the future developments of the CBAM requirements.\n1 Allow using a set of default values if actual data is not available.\nHaving gained insights through the CBAM reporting cycles, we have identified a critical challenge in its implementation: the lack of actual data on embedded emissions which we are currently working to gather from our suppliers. This requirement is based on the assumption that carbon footprint data is available for every item, article, and/or product that is produced, manufactured, and/or assembled. However, this is simply not the case as we are very early in the process of tracking and accounting for every single item that is placed in the stream of commerce. Because we are early in the journey of carbon tracking and accounting at the article and product level, many suppliers lack the technical expertise in carbon accounting, and it is not feasible to build expertise in 12 months. This means that companies like ours face delays as we rely on data\nfrom hundreds of suppliers. In light of these challenges, we recommend allowing the use of\ndefault values if actual data is not available as this would enable smoother implementation while data tracking capabilities mature.\nPAGE | 3\nBaker Hughes $3\n2. Assess competitiveness before expanding the scope of the CBAM Regulation.\nBefore expanding the scope of the CBAM Regulation by including sectors exposed to carbon leakage, the European Commission must conduct a thorough competitiveness assessment. This assessment should include:\ne A dialogue with affected industries that would lose free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System; Impact on buyers of affected goods - this includes evaluating costs stemming from the reporting requirements and purchasing of the CBAM certificates; Review of already included goods, such as CN 7318, which covers screws, bolts, and nuts. These goods usually have low value, while the administrative burden and financial impact of managing CBAM reporting often exceed the value of the goods themselves and the potential cost of certificates.\nIntroduce verification thresholds and phase-in period to minimize risks with the\nimplementation.\nThe verification processes for embedded emissions are expected to impose significant financial and administrative burdens on companies. In some cases, the costs of verification may exceed the value of the CBAM certificates that must be purchased when importing goods that are on the\nCBAM list. To address this, we recommend the introduction of thresholds for when verification\nis required, ensuring that only imports above a certain volume or value would be required to have emissions verified. This would ensure that the process remains manageable for companies importing smaller volumes. Furthermore, supplementary laws on verification process and accreditation of verifiers are not expected to be published before mid-2025 — this short timeline creates many challenges for companies to comply with the CBAM requirements. Firstly, internal processes will not be developed on time. Secondly, we will have a shortage of trained verifiers. For these reasons, the European Commission should consider accelerating the\ndevelopment of secondary legislation and training programmes for verifiers. Additionally, the Commission should introduce a phased approach to implementing verification requirements.\nThis would provide time for businesses to develop internal processes and for the market to build\ncapacity in terms of trained verifiers and assurance providers.\nPAGE | 4\nBaker Hughes $3\nConclusions\nThe introduction of the CBAM intends to ensure a level playing field for European businesses.\nHowever, the existing CBAM requirements create administrative burden for companies as\nhighlighted by the Draghi report. For this reason, it is important that the CBAM supplementary\nlaws will provide additional guidance to facilitate smooth governance in companies.\nBaker Hughes appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to the draft Regulations and would be pleased to discuss should you have any questions.\nAbout Baker Hughes:\nBaker Hughes is an energy technology company that provides solutions to energy and industrial customers worldwide.

In previous opportunities, EEA Members via a joint industry letter recommended the introduction of a CBAM ‘Authorised Representative, arguing that mandating the indirect customs representative as the only possible alternative declarant, especially for EU-based importers, will deter both indirect customs representatives and third-party industry experts from taking on CBAM declarant responsibilities. At the time, we received a response from the Commission indicating that there was no intention to amend the legislation to accommodate our proposal. However, based in our gained experience during the transitional period, it is evident that EU-based importers are content with retaining responsibilities themselves, while still needing assistance with the technical completion of CBAM reports. We also see that some experts are willing to take on full CBAM reporting responsibilities as ‘Authorised Representatives’ but lack the customs expertise to become indirect customs representatives simultaneously. The EEA wishes to inquire whether the Commission, recognizing the clear demand for these alternatives and having encouraged a direct representative-type reporting construct in their own FAQ, plans to amend the CBAM regulation to better reflect this market situation for the full implementation.\nTechnical readiness of CBAM Registry\nThe CBAM Registry is set to apply from 31 December 2024, as stipulated in the CBAM Main Regulation and aligned with Article 24 of this draft implementing Regulation. The EEA emphasizes the critical importance of ensuring that the CBAM Registry is fully operational and that the 31 December 2024 deadline is strictly adhered to. This timeline provides a crucial legal window of one full year, allowing traders ample time to submit their initial CBAM applications and fulfill related obligations well in advance of the 1 January 2026 deadline. This is particularly vital given the extended assessment periods for CBAM applications by competent authorities, as outlined in the Draft Regulation.\nEEA Members remain available should there be questions or requests for clarification. Please kindly provide your feedback to our Secretariat’s functional email tfc@euroexpress.org at your earliest convenience.\nKKK\nThe European Express Association (EEA) is the representative organisation for the express industry in Europe.

        "feedback": "TLF Overseas is the representative federation of French registered customs representatives. As users of the CBAM registry for the transitional period, our members have sent us several points of improvement on which we would like to alert you: — the interface is difficult to use for importers, who have difficulties in connecting and submitting reports without assistance. We consider it important that the final registry can be easily accessible and usable for CBAM declarants. — To that end, all acronyms should be translated into the language in which the register is used. The error messages sent by the register should also indicate which transactions need to be carried out in order to resolve the source of the error (e.g.: indication of the field to be modified, validation of reports in draft or final mode, exclusive boxes – it is now possible to tick in a single profile, the “rapporteur” and “representative” boxes, etc.) – A contact/help desk interface (instant messaging, rdv sockets with a natural person, etc.) should be integrated into the platform to receive assistance or validation of requests from the operator. For example, in order to benefit from a deferred declaration, a deferral number issued by the competent authority is required. However, it is impossible to obtain this number from the register, which prevents the operators concerned from making their declarations. We welcome the possibility for installations to register in the registry for information on carbon emissions. In general, we encourage all functionalities that allow operators established in third countries to engage in CBAM. On the other hand, we still see a reluctance on the part of the latter to share information. Some third party companies even paid for the emissions data to be reported in the quarterly reports. As it has been decided not to exclude small importers from the CBAM, an increased support and optimised user experience of the CBAM registry will be indispensable to increase the number of compliant companies. We thank the European Commission for the opportunity to contribute to this public consultation and remain at its disposal for any useful clarification.",

While preserving the confidentiality of business sensitive information, a high degree of transparency of the CBAM Registry is indispensable for public scrutiny and input, which can lead to more robust and well-considered policies.\nAgainst this background, the signatories of this paper would like to highlight their serious concerns about the expected level of intransparency of the CBAM Registry, especially when compared with the EU ETS Registry. This is due to combination of the provisions of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as those of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956.\nAccording to the current CBAM legal framework (in particular article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956), de facto all information in the CBAM Registry will be deemed as confidential. The Commission would publish only an annual report on total aggregated emissions by CBAM good.\nOn the contrary, the EU ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013 (Annex IX) provides public access to most of the relevant information included in the registry, such as contact details of European installations as well as details on total emissions and free allocation for each installation. This high level of transparency is linked to the explicit reference of recital 28 of the ETS Registry Regulation to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. Instead, no reference to the same legislation is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation.\nAgainst this background, the signatories urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as reviewing the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation in the context of the 2025 revision in order to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry. For instance, such consistency requires that contact details of CBAM declarants and third country operators as well as total emissions and total available CBAM certificates for each of them are made publicly accessible.\nAnnex: legal references\nArticle 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956\n1 The Commission shall establish a CBAM registry of authorised CBAM declarants in the form of a standardised electronic database containing the data regarding the CBAM certificates of those authorised CBAM declarants. The Commission shall make the information in the CBAM registry available automatically and in real time to customs authorities and competent authorities.\n2 The CBAM registry referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain accounts with information about each authorised CBAM declarant, in particular:\n(a) the name, address and contact information of the authorised CBAM declarant:\n(b) the EORI number of the authorised CBAM declarant;\n(c) the CBAM account number;\n(d) the identification number, the sale price, the date of sale, and the date of surrender, repurchase or cancellation of CBAM certificates for each authorised CBAM declarant.\n3 The CBAM registry shall contain, in a separate section of the registry, the information about the operators and installations in third countries registered in accordance with Article 10(2).\n4 The information in the CBAM registry referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be confidential, with the exception of the names, addresses and contact information of the operators and the location of installations in third countries. An operator may choose not to have its name, address and contact information made accessible to the public. The public information in the CBAM registry shall be made accessible by the Commission in an interoperable format.\nas 2 The Commission shall publish, on a yearly basis, for each of the goods listed in Annex I, the aggregated emissions embedded in the imported goods.\n6 The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the infrastructure and specific processes and procedures of the CBAM registry, including the risk analysis referred to in Article 15, the electronic databases containing the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the data of the accounts in the CBAM registry referred to in Article 16, the transmission to the CBAM registry of the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CRAM certificates referred to in Article 20, and the cross-check of information referred to in Article 25(3).

The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the data from the EORI system, in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nRecital 6 of the ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013\n(6) The Union Registry should contain the accounts in which the processes and operations needed to apply the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC should be registered.

        "feedback": "With more than 3,600 members, the VDMA is the largest network organization and an important voice for the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry in Germany and Europe. The association represents the common economic, technical and scientific interests of this unique and diverse industry. VDMA member companies produce many different technological solutions for climate protection and are enablers in the transition to a net-zero economy. However, VDMA believes the CBAM mechanism still needs significant improvement in order to ensure both the competitiveness of European export-oriented companies in the mechanical engineering sector and to attain the desire climate-impact of the CBAM. Considering the authorization of CBAM declarants, our member companies take a cautious view on placing the authorization burden highly on the national authorities considering the lack of administrative support at national level during the first year of CBAM reporting obligations. VDMA encourages the European Commission to support NCAs with CBAM implementation, including mandatory training for the CBAM registry as indicated in Article 17. In more concrete points: 1. For smoother CBAM implementation, VDMA supports that the CBAM declarants test the CBAM registry together with the Member States. This would allow companies to familiarize themselves with the different functions and make suggestions for improvements aiming to accelerate the whole process, while making user-friendly. In this way, current unsuitable functions of the CBAM Portal, such as using Mwh for the energy input, would be avoided minimizing the urge for technical updates bringing new features that need further clarification. The changes at the CBAM portal introduced in October 2024 resulted in significant challenges for companies. In some cases, businesses were required to recreate their reports from scratch, despite the fact the imminent reporting deadline was later that month. This situation underpins the importance of planning and testing technical changes to minimize disruptions and support compliance efforts effectively. 2. Based on feedback from our members regarding Article 19 (Specific role of the Commission and the competent authorities), there is a need for greater clarity on handling challenges, particularly technical issues. This is especially important as CBAM declarants may need to interact with both the Commission and national competent authorities, potentially leading to overlapping responsibilities and added complexity. Clear guidelines on roles and actions are essential to streamline processes and avoid confusion. 3. VDMA calls for mandatory training for the NCAs organized by the European Commission under Article 17 to accelerate efficiency and proper implementation.",

        "feedback": "CLEPA welcomes the initiative to establish a CBAM registry, which holds significant potential to improve data exchange. By streamlining processes and supporting compliance, the registry could play a pivotal role in facilitating smoother operations. Furthermore, the registry offers an opportunity for competent authorities to share the burden of challenging third-country operators when data are missing or lack precision. While these opportunities are promising, CLEPA emphasises the need to address several pressing issues to ensure the CBAM is both effective and manageable. 1. Access to data remains a critical challenge. One of the main challenges in the CBAM is the lack of access to accurate and timely emissions data. A recent survey of CLEPA members revealed that 65% of automotive suppliers receive actual emissions data from less than 10% of their own suppliers. This significant data gap underscores the difficulty of tracking and reporting emissions, particularly for iron and steel products that move through multiple layers of the supply chain. Additional barriers include the inability to switch suppliers due to existing contractual obligations or the need for regulatory approvals, including complex safety certifications. We recommend allowing the use of default or industry-standard emissions values until a substantial portion of suppliers can provide verified data. We further suggest excluding one-time shipments (e.g., for testing purposes) and incorporating provisions for samples and non-recurring deliveries. 2. Administrative burden and compliance costs. The current administrative requirements of CBAM pose substantial challenges. The administrative burden and costs can amount to several hundred thousand euros per reporting period. While the CBAM registry is already a step forward, we recommend the Commission to continue addressing the administrative burden issue. One suggestion would be to streamline the Excel template by focusing on mandatory fields and anticipated future needs (e.g. direct vs. indirect emissions after 2026). To further support compliance, we suggest translating key documents into key partner languages. 3. Proposal for a Weight-Based and CBAM registration Threshold. The current CBAM applies uniform reporting requirements when the value of the shipment is EUR 150 or more. We believe that a weight-based per-shipment threshold would be a more practical and efficient approach. This has proved effective in the risk-based implementation of the REACH regime, where a 1T annual volume threshold excludes compliance requirements for one-off shipments. Higher thresholds would target larger consignments with greater environmental impact, reducing administrative burden. Additionally, an overall customs value threshold, such as the UKs proposed £50,000, combined with a weight-based limit, would ease the reporting burden for low-value, low-impact imports. 4. Allow the company to report for its subsidiaries. The current CBAM poses challenges for multi-subsidiary companies by requiring separate filings tied to each subsidiarys EORI number, even within the same parent company. This increases administrative burden and inefficiencies. Allowing a central filing option, where one entity handles CBAM declarations for all subsidiaries, would streamline compliance, reduce duplication, and better reflect the integrated operations of multinational businesses 5. Allow for Retrospective CBAM registration after import to prevent import blockages. A key forward-looking risk under the current CBAM is that, from 1 January 2026, EU customs authorities will block imports if the importer is not registered as an authorised CBAM declarant. This poses a significant risk to CLEPA members who may need to import CBAM-relevant goods on an ad-hoc basis. Since the CBAM scope includes parts and downstream products essential for machinery, critical goods for automotive, supply chains risk being delayed at the border, causing operational disruption.",

        "feedback": "Federal Association of German Industries on the draft Implementing Regulation for the CBAM Register. Article 9 does not provide for the possibility for declarants to upload and download data. This possibility is explicitly provided for in Article 11 (NCA Portal) for NCAs. The declarants should at least be able to automatically upload and download the reports etc. and have secured access to a test environment. Declarants should also have access (download authorisation) to the data transmitted by the NCA/customs authorities to the registry. Most of the statements in the draft are vague and therefore do not allow conclusions to be drawn as to the actual implementation and the resulting burden on declarants/operators. For example, in Article 21(2).  The operators may access... How should the declarants contact the operators to get access? Do operators have to activate all declarants individually? Is machine-to-machine communication planned and, if so, how exactly? We would ask you to consider the feedback as provisional, as companies are still in the process of capturing the scope and scope.

        "pdf_text": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the implementing act on the CBAM registry.\nWe would like to ask you to consider the following points.\ne Business continuity risk due to IT solution maturity The CBAM registry seems to be a very complex IT endeavor, given the number of stakeholders, components (5, as per article 5, potentially multiplied by the number of Member States), roles — and the number of interconnections to other EU IT systems (6 mentioned in Art. 5; letter (e) missing) - and the listed functionality doesn’t even cover all the needs (e.g. no IT provisions are defined for CBAM certificate management). The business continuity plan is not yet established either. Further, there is no definition of responsibility split between the EC-managed database (recital 1), and the national components (art. 7 seems to suggest “terms of collaboration, service level agreements and a security plan,”), nor a requirement for joint CBAM registry testing (art. 14(1)) - even though the combination of the national components to be maintained by the competent authorities would justify a test executed with participation of both the EC and the Member States - akin to that in art. 14(3). It is not clear if all the requisite CBAM registry functionality can be implemented, tested and matured in the time available; allowing for stable system use from January 1*, 2026. This poses a serious business continuity risk to importers. Please consider the time required for importers to learn the new tools and complete the authorization procedure, such that importers can achieve declarant status well before January 1*, 2026 and continue operating from January 1* 2026 onwards. Risk of divergence between Member States Unclear responsibilities for MS-specific components could lead to divergence in the way the modules are implemented. This bears a risk of confusion and errors in reporting, especially for actors importing CBAM-scoped goods into multiple EU Member States. Equally, lack of harmonized training provided by the Commission (Art. 17) poses a risk of divergence and will lead to duplication of efforts by all MSs. Please prevent the divergence between the Member States. Please consider providing training at the EU level. CBAM certificate management Even though the document mentions CBAM certificate management twice (in recital 1 and in art. 18, under data protection), there are no details on how CBAM certificate management will work (e.g. not mentioned in art. 3 nor art. 9), nor whether any technical provisions will be required (interconnection to other systems, EU and external). There are further no rules specified for the case if the yearly due is smaller than the value of a single certificate. Please clarify all those details. Installation data If all data in CBAM registry is confidential, how can the declarants access the data (art. 9 (3)) provided by installation operators (art. 10) on the installations relevant to them? Please define the rules for installation data access for importers.\nInstallation operator obligations w.r.t. CBAM registry Art. 10(3): is it unclear, if the installation operators are REQUIRED to create an account in the CBAM registry, or if the CBAM declarants can supply the information on installations relevant to them. Please clarify if installation operators are obliged to provide information in the CBAM registry. Changes to CBAM registry functionality Art. 15(2)&(3): also other actors, incl. CBAM declarants, shall be informed about functionality changes, well in advance, to allow for adaptations of internal processes and tools.\ne\nIn addition, we would like to share one additional comment on COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EV) 2023/1773. In article 4 it is stated that usage of default values is only permissible in 2024 during the transitional period. However, we have noticed while compiling our reports during the transitional period, that in several cases the quarterly monetary value of our imports from a particular supplier is rather low. In such a case, the burden to collect and validate the installation emission information is disproportionate to the theoretical carbon emission differences (or achievable emission savings).\nIn the spirit of the keeping European industry competitive and avoiding disproportionate burden, we would like to ask for the CBAM regulation (EU) 2023/956 to be modified to allow for using the Commission-defined default values past the current transitional period, including using the defaults for the declarations leading to CBAM certificate surrendering (if necessary, up to a defined threshold of quarterly monetary value of the import)."

The Commission shall make the information in the CBAM registry available automatically and in real time to customs authorities and competent authorities.\n2 The CBAM registry referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain accounts with information about each authorised CBAM declarant, in particular:\n(a) the name, address and contact information of the authorised CBAM declarant:\n(b) the EORI number of the authorised CBAM declarant;\n(c) the CBAM account number;\n(d) the identification number, the sale price, the date of sale, and the date of surrender, repurchase or cancellation of CBAM certificates for each authorised CBAM declarant.\n3 The CBAM registry shall contain, in a separate section of the registry, the information about the operators and installations in third countries registered in accordance with Article 10(2).\n4 The information in the CBAM registry referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be confidential, with the exception of the names, addresses and contact information of the operators and the location of installations in third countries. An operator may choose not to have its name, address and contact information made accessible to the public. The public information in the CBAM registry shall be made accessible by the Commission in an interoperable format.\nas 2 The Commission shall publish, on a yearly basis, for each of the goods listed in Annex I, the aggregated emissions embedded in the imported goods.\n6 The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the infrastructure and specific processes and procedures of the CBAM registry, including the risk analysis referred to in Article 15, the electronic databases containing the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the data of the accounts in the CBAM registry referred to in Article 16, the transmission to the CBAM registry of the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CRAM certificates referred to in Article 20, and the cross-check of information referred to in Article 25(3). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2).\nArticle 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation\nArticle 2]\nLimitation of data access, data processing and confidentiality\nAll information held in the CBAM registry shall be considered confidential. The authorised CBAM declarants and applicants may access personal data registered in the CBAM registry after their registration in the registry. The operators may access their personal data registered in the CBAM registry after their registration in the registry. Authorised CBAM declarants may access personal data registered by operators in the CBAM registry or otherwise processed those data, where authorisation in that respect was granted by the operators. The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the personal data and other data from Customs Import Declarations for goods not listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the data from the EORI system, in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nRecital 6 of the ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013\n(6) The Union Registry should contain the accounts in which the processes and operations needed to apply the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC should be registered.

        "pdf_text": "Opinion of the Korean Steel Industry on the EU CBAM Implementing Regulation\n2024. 11. 26., Korea Iron and Steel Association\n<Introduction>\nThe Korea Iron and Steel Association represents the Korean steel\nindustry and has a total of 45 steel companies and distributors as\nmembers. Regarding the two EU CBAM(Carbon Border Adjustment\nMechanism) Implementing Regulations announced on October 30\nand 31, 2024, our association would like to submit the following\nopinions to the EU Commission on behalf of the Korean steel\nindustry.\n* Authorizing CBAM declarant('24.10.30), Eatablishment of CBAM registry('24.10.31)\nOn July 14, 2021, the “EU CBAM’ legislative bill with the goal of\ncarbon neutrality in the European continent was finalized in the EU Parliament in April 2023. The purpose of the bill is to alleviate\nconcerns over carbon leakage due to differences in carbon regulation levels between countries. The Korean steel industry recognizes the need for global carbon reduction and has _ been communicating and cooperating with the EU Commission closely\nthrough interviews and submission of official opinions on the\nCBAM and its implementing regulation.\n-1-\nThe above CBAM implementing regulations contain some\nunreasonable and uncertain elements in the detailed procedures.\nThis will significantly increase the economic and administrative\nburden on exporters from third countries, and. will Cause\nuncertainty in trade and industry between the two countries.\nAccordingly, the Korea Iron and Steel Association strongly urges\nthat smooth trade relations and mutually complementary industrial\nstructures between the two. countries can be maintained by\nresolving uncertainty through the review of the EU’s CBAM\nimplementing regulations.\n<Main Opinion\n1. Necessity to shorten the review and approval period for CBAM\ndeclarant application\nAccording to Article 4 of the Authorizing CBAM declarant\nImplementing regulation, the CBAM authority can review the\ndeclarant application submitted by the importer for 120 days. In\naddition, according to Article 5 of the same regulation, if there are\nadditional documents requested by the CBAM authority, the review\nperiod can take up to 180 days from the date of application. In\naddition, there is no specific period for the reassessment of\ndeclarant qualification under Articles 19 and 20 of the same regulation.\n-2-\nThis application review and approval period is considerably\nexcessive, as it could take up to 6 months from application to final\napproval if an issue such as a change in the declarant arises during\nthe definitive period('26~), which could restrict imports during that\nperiod. In addition, in order to import products subject to CBAM\nwithout a hitch from January 1, 2026, the declarant approval\nprocedures for importers must be completed by then. However,\nconsidering the number of importers in the EU, application\ndocuments, and review period, there are concerns that not all\napplications may be approved by 2025.\nAccordingly, the Korean steel industry requests a shortening of the\nabsolute review and approval period, temporary import permits\nwhen the review period is exceeded, simplification of the review\nprocedure for applications as a declarant for importers who\nfaithfully continued fulfilling their reporting obligations during the\ntransition period('23.10~'25), and specification of a declarant\nqualification reassessment period.\n2. Necessity to specify the types of information that third-country\nproducers can enter directly into the registry\nAccording to Article 10 of the Establishment of CBAM registry\nImplementing regulation, third-country producers can directly enter\nbasic information such as company name, address, and_ business\n-3-\nregistration number, as well as information on production facilities\nand products, into the registry. This can also be confirmed through\nthe ‘EU CBAM Q&A’ released on October 24, 2024.\nHowever, since the types of sensitive information(emissions\ninformation, etc.) that third-country producers can directly enter are\nnot specified in detail in this regulation, confusion may arise in\ncarrying out future work.\nTo avoid the above confusion, the Korean steel industry requests the\nEU Commission to provide specific details on the types of sensitive\ninformation that third-country producers can register directly.\n3. Other Suggestions\nThere were instances in the early transition period where technical\nfaults within the registry caused difficulties in CBAM reporting.\nAccordingly, we request that the EU Commission prevent technical\nfaults in a series of computer work processes, such as submitting\nthe declarant application and uploading data from third-country\nproducers.\nAs mentioned above, the Korea Iron and Steel Association presents\nits opinion to the EU Commission on behalf of the Korean steel\nindustry on the EU’s CBAM Implementing Regulations.\n-A-"

It is the highest body of the industry trade union system and, since its foundation in 1938, it has defended the interests of the national industry. It also acts as the main interlocutor with the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary, besides several entities and organizations in Brazil and abroad. We represent 27 state federations of industry and 1.280 trade unions, to which almost 700 thousand industries are affiliated.\nSince its establishment, CNI has played a leading role in society, promoting debate and building consensus on key national issues. Especially concerning those matters that have strong influence on the development of Brazilian industry and economy. CNI is recognized as a key voice at the national level, examining and presenting suggestions for the development and refinement of policies and laws that strengthen the productive sector and modernizes the country.\nStructure of the CBAM Registry (Article 4)\nThe CBAM Registry’s components, such as the CBAM Operators Portal (CBAM Operator), and the public CBAM page on the European Union website (namely the Europa website), are extremely important for foreign producers, entities representing foreign producers and operators.\nTherefore, CNI urges the Commission to provide timely, accurate and clear information for all stakeholders so that operation of the registry does not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade.\nCBAM Operators Portal (Article 10)\nWhile Article 10 provides several obligations regarding profile assignment and registry access for operators, further clarification is still needed. This relates specifically to operational processes,\nCNI\nConfederacdo Nacional da Industria\n—\nSBN Quadra 1 Bloco C - Ed.

Topics to be covered in the regulation include specific timelines for reviewing and approving requests submitted to the Commission, feedback if supporting documents are deemed insufficient, confirmation of profile, and whether any additional verification steps or document requirements may apply beyond those listed.\nTraining and Communication Support on the Use and Functioning of the CBAM Registry (Article 17)\nArticle 17 states that the Commission may support the competent authorities in the use and functioning of the components of the CBAM registry by providing the appropriate training and communication material, and that the competent authorities are responsible for managing trainings and providing the national service desk support to authorized CBAM declarants and applicants.\nGiven the substantial burden imposed by CBAM and the voluntary nature of the registration for operators and installations in third countries, it is crucial that the Commission and/or competent authorities offer technical training or user guides. This will assist operators, companies and entities in third countries to navigate the CBAM Operators Portal and make available dedicated helpdesk services or contact points for resolving technical issues.\nConfidentiality\nConsidering the confidential nature of most of the information to be provided by operators from installations in third countries, particularly data on production cost and process details, the Commission shall clearly state which information is inherently confidential. The Commission should also outline the guarantees to ensure that such information will not be made available or leaked to the public. Furthermore, the Commission shall allow for the request for confidential treatment of data submitted by operators and installations in third countries.\nAdvantages for Operators and Installations in Third Countries\nIn light of the significant burden imposed by CBAM and the voluntary nature of the registration for operators and installations in third countries, as required by Article 10 of the CBAM Regulation, the Commission should consider affording additional benefits to companies willing to provide their real emissions and comply with Article 10 requirements.\nCNI\nSBN Quadra 1 Bloco C - Ed.

To do so, the emissions produced by CBAM goods must be determined accurately, especially as calculation methodologies have proven to be misused in many countries outside of the EU to artificially increase the biogenic content of products. In this regard, the only reliable method to accurately determine the biogenic content of the emissions is the Carbon-14 methodology.\nHence, Approaches solely rely on calculation methodologies, which routinely and systematically overestimate biogenic content, creating an environment ripe for fraud and greenwashing as they can lead to over-reporting / under-reporting of the biogenic percentage of emissions. This is particularly important for CBAM goods as such methodology was at the centre of the biofuel fraud cases encountered by the EU in 2023, which saw a dramatic drop in biofuel prices in the EU and many plant closures. This is why we also recommend that the CBAM incorporates specific guidelines for the reporting and verification of data for CBAM goods, notably the measurement of the CO2 stack emissions at the point of combustion using C14 testing, as it is the most reliable and precise way to measure the biogenic content in CO2 emissions. Similar programs in other countries already require regular biogenic testing such as the US EPA and the UK/EU ETS, which has proven to accurately determine the biogenic fraction of emissions. CBAM goods produced emitting emissions with higher biogenic content should be taken into account while assessing the carbon prices and allowances to ensure that operators around the world are encouraged to follow the best practices and respect the emissions reduction goals.\nThis would be the most effective approach to achieving the program’s goals and would create consistency with the ETS. It would also prevent over-reporting/under-reporting of CBAM goods emissions, which would put EU goods at a disadvantage. As the biogenic content in emissions can vary greatly from one country to another and methodologies might differ, one of the main challenges of the registry will be to ensure that the data collected by different verifiers in different countries are comparable to assess carbon pricing. Measuring the CO2 emissions using C14 is the most reliable method to report data, and for verifiers to verify data. This method also allows verifiers to have standardized results available for them to analyze and assess as they are, easily comparable from one installation to another.\nPage 2\nBeta Analytic, Inc. 4985 SW 74\" Court Miami, FL 33155 USA Tel: 305-667-5167 Fax: 305-663-0964 info@betalabservices.com\nBeta Anal ytic\nTESTING LABORATORY\nISO/IEC 17025:2017-Accredited Testing Laboratory\nDirect biogenic content testing is a well-established best practice for regulating stationary source emissions in prominent successful emissions reporting, cap and trade programs. Routine biogenic testing requirements currently provide critical data to the US EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), Canada’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and California’s Cap and Trade Program’. The US EPA’s GHGRP is especially important to consider because it has successfully required mandatory quarterly testing and reporting of biogenic content using ASTM D6866 for over 12 years.\nHence, we recommend that the emissions seeking a biogenic content be subject to direct biogenic content testing (‘*C) requirements following the ASTM D6866 Method B standard or equivalent. Routine direct biogenic testing requirements are the only reliable method of incentivizing the use of biomass-derived feedstocks and guaranteeing compliance. They currently play a critical role in prominent decarbonisation programs around the world. This is particularly true for feedstocks that might have an unknown biogenic content, such as MSW. Including those data within the CBAM Register will allow for the biogenic content to be more transparent and avoid over-estimation. One of the main issues with a calculation-based approach, such as mass balance, is that many data included within the calculation are self-declared and not substantiated. Hence, producers could claim that their feedstocks are 100% biogenic without actually having to justify this biogenic content. The discrepancy will impact directly the sustainable component of the fuels of the CBAM Registry and be misleading.\nThis threat was particularly highlighted by the recent mass balance fraud challenge faced by the ISCC regarding fraudulent biodiesel submissions from East Asia which “caused a dramatic fall in biodiesel prices in European markets” in July 2023. In response to this situation, the EU quickly updated the Renewable Energy Directive (RED)’s co-processing rules to uniformly require direct testing, including for producers choosing calculation-based approaches to verify their calculations using direct testing to prove and verify claims. Hence, this highlights how difficult tracking and verifying calculation-based methodologies made outside of the EU is, and how strict and easily verified data is a crucial part of the CBAM Registry.\nMore recently, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a federal action against the mass- balance methodology in August 2024*. The Agency highlighted concerns about the mass-balance methodology being used to assess the recycled content of plastics as it misleads the consumers. One of the main concerns is that the mass-balance methodology and accounting can be used to artificially inflate the recycled content of products. A ProPublic investigation revealed in June 2024 that products advertised as 30% recycled through mass balance often contained less than 1% recycled content. Similar concerns were shown by the US EPA as early as 2023, which described the mass-balance methodology as deceptive\n1\n2016. “40 CFR Part 98 Subpart C— General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources.” National Archives Code of Federal Regulations 2022. “Canada’s Greenhouse Gas Quantification Requirements.” Environment and Climate Change Canada\n2\n2024, “Biden EPA Rejects Plastics Industry’s Fuzzy Math That Misleads Customers About Recycled Content”, ProPublica.\neee eee nner e ee eee eee eee\neee eee eee eee ee\nPage 3\nBeta Analytic, Inc. 4985 SW 74\" Court Miami, FL 33155 USA Tel: 305-667-5167 Fax: 305-663-0964 info@betalabservices.com\nBeta Anal ytic\nTESTING LABORATORY\nISO/IEC 17025:2017-Accredited Testing Laboratory\nand advised against promoting it?. Following the publication of the federal case, the US EPA updated the methodology for its Safer Choice label, requiring the recycled content to be determined by weight post- consumer, effectively prohibiting the mass-balance methodology from being used to certify products under the Safer Choice program*. The New York Times also recently published a relevant article on the challenges mass balance presents to the recycling industry, which aligns with the challenges experienced in the renewable products industry*. While those examples concern recycled plastic, the issues highlighted by those articles also apply to the low-carbon fuels sectors, even more as this sector is pivotal for the emissions reduction goal. Hence, similar concerns were shown by various member states and environmental organisations for renewable energy, including in the above-mentioned 2023 ISCC-certified Biofuel fraud case. Hence, we recommend improving the traceability of the biogenic content within the CBAM Registry by using regular Carbon-14 testing for feedstocks/emissions seeking a biogenic percentage. Direct testing and reporting will also allow for verifiers to easily verify the data added to the Union database (Article 3(2.)) and improve the reliability of the Database.\nAdditionally, as the CBAM registry will heavily rely on certificates and declarations, it is also essential that when seeking biogenic content, such declarations be proven by direct C14 testing. Our recommendation as a laboratory that has worked with many programs around the world is that verification of emissions should be performed by accredited bodies with the expertise to accurately verify the data presented by operators. We recommend that one of the minimum criteria be third-party testing by a tracer-free, ISO 17025:2017 accredited laboratory for biogenic content. Third-party biobased testing via carbon-14 testing (ASTM D6866, EN 16640, ISO 16620) should be included for all claims to be directly comparable. Primary data in the form of direct sample testing of biobased materials by a third party will provide greater accuracy in environmental claims of biobased content and can be verified as scientific information. Such concerns were notably raised in May 2024 by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration® regarding biofuel tax credits being wrongly awarded. One of the issues was that certificates were falsified, which led to nearly % of the biofuel tax credits being wrongfully issued.\nWhat is Biogenic Testing (Carbon-14)?\nCarbon-14 analysis is a reliable method used to distinguish the percentage of biobased carbon content in a given material. The radioactive isotope carbon-14 is present in all living organisms and recently expired material, whereas any fossil-based material that is more than 50,000 years old does not contain any\n3\n2023, “U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) comment on the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed rule entitled “Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims”.

Since Carbon-14 is radioactive, the amount of carbon-14 present in a given sample begins to gradually decay after the death of an organism until there is no carbon-14 left. Therefore, a radiocarbon dating laboratory can use carbon-14 analysis to quantify the carbon-14 content present ina sample, determining whether the sample is biomass-based, fossil fuel-derived, or a combination.\nThe analysis is based on standards such as ASTM D6866 and its international equivalents developed for specific end uses, such as the European standard ISO 21644. ASTM D6866 is an international standard developed for measuring the biobased carbon content of solid, liquid, and gaseous samples using radiocarbon dating.’ There are also many specific international standards based on the use of direct Carbon-14 testing, such as ISO 21644, which is a European standard developed for measuring the biogenic carbon content of waste-derived fuels as a fraction of total carbon content.®\nCarbon-14 analysis yields a result reported as % biobased carbon content. If the result is 100% biobased carbon, this indicates that the sample tested is completely sourced from biomass material such as plant or animal byproducts. A result of 0% biobased carbon means a sample is only fossil fuel-derived. A sample that is a mix of both biomass sources and fossil fuel sources will yield a result that ranges between 0% and 100% biobased carbon content. Carbon-14 testing has been incorporated into several regulations as the recommended or required method to quantify the biobased content of a given material.\nASTM D6866 Method B - The Most Reliable Method\nCarbon-14 is a very well-established method which has been in use by many industries (including the fossil fuel industry) and academic researchers for several decades.\nCarbon-14 measurements done by commercial third-party testing are robust, consistent, and with quantifiable accuracy/precision of the carbon-14 amount under ASTM D6866 method B. The EN 16785 is the only standard that allows a variant of the Mass Balance (MB) method of ‘carbon counting’ under EN 16785-2. The EN 16785-1 requires that the biocarbon fraction be determined by the carbon-14 method. However, when incorporating this EN 16785 method, certification schemes like the “Single European Bio- based Content Certification” only allow the use of EN 16785-1 due to its reliability and the value of a third- party certification. http://www.biobasedcontent.eu/en/about-us/\nIn ASTM D6866 method B, the carbon-14 result is provided as a single numerical result of carbon-14 activity, with a graphical representation that is easily understood by regulators, policymakers, corporate\n7\n2021. “Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis.” ASTM International (D6866-21)\n8\n2021. “ISO 21644:2021 Solid recovered fuels: Methods for the determination of biomass content.” International Standardization Organization\nPage 5\nBeta Analytic, Inc. 4985 SW 74\" Court Miami, FL 33155 USA Tel: 305-667-5167 Fax: 305-663-0964 info@betalabservices.com\nBeta Anal ytic\nTESTING LABORATORY\nISO/IEC 17025:2017-Accredited Testing Laboratory\nofficers, and more importantly, the public. The overwhelming advantage of carbon-14 is that it is an independent and standardized laboratory measurement of any carbon-containing substance that produces highly accurate and precise values. In that regard, it can stand alone as a quantitative indicator of the presence of biobased vs. petroleum feedstocks. When carbon-14 test results are challenged, samples can be rapidly remeasured to verify the original reported values (unlike mass balance).\nThe quantification of the biobased content of a given product can be as low as 0.1% to 0.5% (1 relative standard deviation — RSD) based on Instrumental error for Method B (AMS). This error is exclusive of indeterminate sources of error in the origin of the biobased content, and manufacturing processes. As such a total error of +/-3% (absolute) has been assigned to the reported Biobased Content to account for determinate and indeterminate factors.°\nIt is also important that the program should always require ASTM D6866 Method B, rather than allow Method C for any use. Where ASTM D6866 Method B uses the AMS Instrument to measure “*C, Method C uses Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC). In Method B, the AMS Instrument directly measures the “C isotopes. However, in Method C, scintillation molecules indirectly absorb the beta molecules that are released with the decay of “C and convert the energy into photons which are measured proportionally to the amount of “C in the sample. Since Method B directly measures the “C isotopes and Method C measures them indirectly, Method B is significantly more precise and should be prioritized in regulations.*° LSC measurements, like those used in Method C, are commonly used as an internal testing tool when samples are limited and accuracy does not need to be extremely high.\nAbout Beta Analytic\nBeta Analytic was among the originators of the use of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) for the ASTM D6866 biobased / biogenic testing standard using Carbon-14 to distinguish renewable carbon sources from petroleum sources. Beta began testing renewable content in 2003 at the request of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) representatives who were interested in Beta’s Carbon-14 capabilities for their BioPreferred® Program (www.biopreferred.gov). At their request, Beta joined ASTM under subcommittee D20.96. Beta’s previous president, Darden Hood, was positioned as a technical contact for the USDA and within 3 months completed the ASTM D6866-04 standard. The Carbon-14 technique is now standardized in a host of international standards including ASTM D6866, CEN 16137, EN 16640, ISO 16620, ISO 19984, BS EN ISO 21644:2021, ISO 13833 and EN 16785.

This accreditation is unbiased, third party awarded and supervised. It is unique to laboratories that not only have a quality management program conformant to the ISO 9001:2008 standard, but more importantly, have demonstrated to an outside third-party laboratory accreditation body that Beta Analytic has the technical competency necessary to consistently deliver technically valid test results. The ISO 17025 accreditation is specifically for natural level radiocarbon activity measurements including biobased analysis of consumer products and fuels, and for radiocarbon dating.\nRequired tracer-free facility for Carbon-14\nFor *C measurement to work, be accurate, and be repeatable, the facility needs to be a tracer-free facility, which means artificial/labelled “C is not and has never been handled in that lab. Facilities that handle artificial *C use enormous levels relative to natural levels and it becomes ubiquitous in the facility and cross contamination within the facility, equipment and chemistry lines is unavoidable. Results from a facility that handles artificial '*C would show elevated renewable contents (higher pMC, % Biobased / Biogenic values), making those results invalid. Because of this, Federal contracts and agency programs (such as the USDA BioPreferred Program) require that AMS laboratories must be 14C tracer-free facilities to be considered for participation in solicitations.\nPage 7\nBeta Analytic, Inc. 4985 SW 74\" Court Miami, FL 33155 USA Tel: 305-667-5167 Fax: 305-663-0964 info@betalabservices.com\nBeta Anal ytic\nTESTING LABORATORY\nISO/IEC 17025:2017-Accredited Testing Laboratory\nAreas where cross-contamination might occur include but are not limited to; biomedical or nuclear reactors, isotope enrichment/depletion columns, water, soil, plant, or air samples collected near or at biomedical/nuclear reactor sites, medical, industrial, or hazardous waste sites, samples specifically manipulated to study the uptake/fractionation of stable isotopes due to biological or metabolic processes.

This position paper identifies certain inconsistencies in the draft text establishing the CBAM registry while providing respective solutions for the issues identified.\nMain concerns\nWe have pinpointed certain elements of the draft Implementing Regulation that could benefit from refinement and present the following recommendations to enhance its effectiveness and comprehension:\n1 Responsibility for communicating decisions on penalties\nArticle 4(2) states the following:\n“The competent authority of the Member State of establishment of the authorised CBAM declarant, or a person other than an authorised CBAM declarant introducing goods into the customs territory of the Union in the cases described in Article 26(2) of the Regulation (EU) 2023/956, shall communicate the decisions on penalties linked to enforcement and penalties to the Commission by electronic systems developed at national level.”\nThe phrasing in Article 4(2) is missing a preposition, without which it leads to the implication that both the “competent authority” and the “person other than an authorised CBAM declarant (...)” are responsible for communicating the decisions on penalties. The purpose of Article 4(2) should be to attach the responsibility for communicating the decisions on penalties solely to the competent authority and not to other entities, therefore it should be amended to reflect this.\nRecommendation: Amend Article 4(2) to prevent misinterpretations and ensure enforcement mechanisms operate as predicted in Article 26(4) of the CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956. One solution would be to add the preposition “of” before “a person other than an authorised CBAM declarant (...)”: a “The competent authority of the Member State of establishment of the authorised CBAM declarant, or of a person other than an authorised CBAM declarant (...)”\nFe\nAS\n2 2\neee ee eee\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\neV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: SUPPLYING EUROPE’S ENERGY AND DIGITAL TRANSITIONS\noe\nNOVEMBER 2024\n2. Legal clarity in Article 10\na Article 10 on ‘CBAM Operators Portal’ provides a detailed description of one of the components of the broader CBAM registry, namely, the portal used by and for operators of installations in third countries. However, the wording across Article 10 does not clearly specify that the portal addressed is meant for operators of installations in third countries, possibly leading to confusion in the legal text.\n>\nRecommendation: Amend Article 10 to explicitly refer to operators of installations in third countries, ensuring consistency with the scope of Article 10 of the CBAM Requlation (EU) 2023/956.\nArticle 10(2) identifies three actions operators of installations can conduct within the CBAM Operators Portal, and point (b) of that article suggests operators can register “information on the goods produced by an installation”. The wording in point (b) is ambiguous and can lead to the interpretation that operators will be allowed to register information on goods produced by installations other than their own\nRecommendation: Revise Article 10(2), point (b), by replacing “information on the goods produced by an installation” with “information on the goods produced by az its installation’.\n>\nDefining “business continuity plan”\nArticle 16 on the ‘Temporary failure of the CBAM registry’ refers to a “business continuity plan” that lays down the means that must be followed by CBAM declarants and applicants in the event of a temporary failure of the CBAM registry. However, no information has been shared with CBAM stakeholders regarding this “business continuity plan’, nor is this tool referred to in the CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nRecommendation: For transparency purposes, and to guarantee an adequately informed public consultation process, the Commission should provide further details about the “business continuity plan”, either by defining it or by properly explaining what the business continuity plan will consist of in the legal text.\n>\nUnclear balance between data confidentiality and data sharing\nArticle 21 on the ‘Limitation of data access, data processing and confidentiality’ notes that all information in the CBAM registry shall be considered confidential, while at the same time stating that CBAM declarants will be able to access different types of personal data in the CBAM registry. The wording in Article 21 should clarify the type of information the different actors within the CBAM ecosystem (e.g. CBAM declarants) will have access to and under which of the five portals composing the CBAM registry. Moreover, the implementing Regulation should strive to mirror the ETS framework where possible (e.g. ETS Registry Regulation 2019/1122).\n>\nRecommendation: Adjust Article 21 in order to provide more clarity regarding data confidentiality, access, and data sharing protocols, while describing the different pieces of information that compose the concept of “personal data’. Furthermore, it should be considered that Article 1(2) of the CBAM Regulation describes CBAM as a framework that, in relation to the ETS, applies “an equivalent set of rules to imports into the customs\nEurometaux - European Association of Metals\nAvenue de Tervueren 168, Box 13 | B-1150 Brussels | Tel: +32 (2) 775 63 11 | www.eurometaux.eu | eurometaux@eurometaux.be | @Eurometaux\neV | Eurometaux\nMETALS: SUPPLYING EUROPE’S ENERGY AND DIGITAL TRANSITIONS\noe\nNOVEMBER 2024\nterritory of the Union of the goods referred to in Article 2” of the CBAM Regulation.

While preserving the confidentiality of business sensitive information, a high degree of transparency of the CBAM Registry is indispensable for public scrutiny and input, which can lead to more robust and well-considered policies.\nAgainst this background, the signatories of this paper would like to highlight their serious concerns about the expected level of intransparency of the CBAM Registry, especially when compared with the EU ETS Registry. This is due to combination of the provisions of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as those of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956.\nAccording to the current CBAM legal framework (in particular article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956), de facto all information in the CBAM Registry will be deemed as confidential. The Commission would publish only an annual report on total aggregated emissions by CBAM good.\nOn the contrary, the EU ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013 (Annex IX) provides public access to most of the relevant information included in the registry, such as contact details of European installations as well as details on total emissions and free allocation for each installation. This high level of transparency is linked to the explicit reference of recital 28 of the ETS Registry Regulation to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. Instead, no reference to the same legislation is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation.\nAgainst this background, the signatories urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as reviewing the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation in the context of the 2025 revision in order to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry. For instance, such consistency requires that contact details of CBAM declarants and third country operators as well as total emissions and total available CBAM certificates for each of them are made publicly accessible.\nAnnex: legal references\nArticle 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956\n1 The Commission shall establish a CBAM registry of authorised CBAM declarants in the form of a standardised electronic database containing the data regarding the CBAM certificates of those authorised CBAM declarants. The Commission shall make the information in the CBAM registry available automatically and in real time to customs authorities and competent authorities.\n2 The CBAM registry referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain accounts with information about each authorised CBAM declarant, in particular:\n(a) the name, address and contact information of the authorised CBAM declarant:\n(b) the EORI number of the authorised CBAM declarant;\n(c) the CBAM account number;\n(d) the identification number, the sale price, the date of sale, and the date of surrender, repurchase or cancellation of CBAM certificates for each authorised CBAM declarant.\n3 The CBAM registry shall contain, in a separate section of the registry, the information about the operators and installations in third countries registered in accordance with Article 10(2).\n4 The information in the CBAM registry referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be confidential, with the exception of the names, addresses and contact information of the operators and the location of installations in third countries. An operator may choose not to have its name, address and contact information made accessible to the public. The public information in the CBAM registry shall be made accessible by the Commission in an interoperable format.\nas 2 The Commission shall publish, on a yearly basis, for each of the goods listed in Annex I, the aggregated emissions embedded in the imported goods.\n6 The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the infrastructure and specific processes and procedures of the CBAM registry, including the risk analysis referred to in Article 15, the electronic databases containing the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the data of the accounts in the CBAM registry referred to in Article 16, the transmission to the CBAM registry of the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CRAM certificates referred to in Article 20, and the cross-check of information referred to in Article 25(3). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2).\nArticle 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation\nArticle 2]\nLimitation of data access, data processing and confidentiality\nAll information held in the CBAM registry shall be considered confidential.

The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the personal data and other data from Customs Import Declarations for goods not listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the data from the EORI system, in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nRecital 6 of the ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013\n(6) The Union Registry should contain the accounts in which the processes and operations needed to apply the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC should be registered.

        "feedback": "Dear Authorities, The definition and functionality of the \"CBAM Operators Portal\" is a very important point within the scope of the draft regulation. However, it has been observed that the details regarding the scope of the portal are not clear in the draft text. In particular, it is unclear whether the institutions (raw material suppliers) that perform embedded emission calculations are included in this scope. In this context, we think that the following issues should be clarified: 1. Scope of the Portal: It should be clarified whether only importers and actors directly carrying CBAM obligations will be included in the CBAM Operators Portal or whether raw material suppilers that perform embedded emission calculations will also be integrated into the system. 2. Difficulty of the Process and Adaptation: The obligations brought by CBAM require a difficult process for all stakeholders in the sector, both technically and operationally. In particular, it will not be easy for the CBAM Operators Portal to be used effectively and for all stakeholders to adapt to the process quickly. Therefore, we would like to emphasize that additional support mechanisms (e.g. guidance documents, training programs, technical support lines) should be provided during the implementation process. 3.Product-Specific Processes and Emissions Data: The manufacturing processes for our products can vary significantly based on customer-specific requirements, resulting in different carbon calculations for various product types. In the online declaration system, emissions data for multiple product types will be reported and shared centrally. In this context, it remains unclear whether customers will be expected to independently select the appropriate emissions data for their specific products or whether we, as suppliers, will have the ability to directly provide and share the precise emissions values relevant to each customers product. The success of CBAM can only be achieved with accurate and reliable emission calculations. Therefore, we believe that it is critical for both the operation of the system and the implementation that the institutions performing embedded emission calculations are included among the actors defined in the portal.",

        "feedback": "As the Polish Steel Association (HIPH), we would like to present our position on the public consultation regarding the draft Regulation on the CBAM Registry. The draft Regulation offers a critical opportunity to reflect on the design and functionality of the electronic infrastructure necessary for the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). While it is essential to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive business information, a high level of transparency in the CBAM Registry is crucial for public scrutiny and input. This transparency can lead to more robust and well-considered policies. We have serious concerns about the expected lack of transparency in the CBAM Registry, especially when compared to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Registry. The current CBAM legal framework, particularly article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956, effectively deems all information in the CBAM Registry as confidential. The Commission would only publish an annual report on total aggregated emissions by CBAM goods. In contrast, the EU ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013 (Annex IX) provides public access to most relevant information, including contact details of European installations and details on total emissions and free allocation for each installation. This high level of transparency is linked to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, which is explicitly referenced in the ETS Registry Regulation. However, no such reference is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation. We urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and review the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation during the 2025 revision. It is essential to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry. For instance, this consistency requires that contact details of CBAM declarants and third-country operators, as well as total emissions and total available CBAM certificates for each of them, are made publicly accessible.",

While preserving the confidentiality of business sensitive information, a high degree of transparency of the CBAM Registry is indispensable for public scrutiny and input, which can lead to more robust and well-considered policies.\nAgainst this background, the signatories of this paper would like to highlight their serious concerns about the expected level of intransparency of the CBAM Registry, especially when compared with the EU ETS Registry. This is due to combination of the provisions of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as those of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956.\nAccording to the current CBAM legal framework (in particular article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956), de facto all information in the CBAM Registry will be deemed as confidential.

This high level of transparency is linked to the explicit reference of recital 28 of the ETS Registry Regulation to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. Instead, no reference to the same legislation is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation.\nAgainst this background, the signatories urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as reviewing the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation in the context of the 2025 revision in order to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry.

An operator may choose not to have its name, address and contact information made accessible to the public. The public information in the CBAM registry shall be made accessible by the Commission in an interoperable format.\nas 2 The Commission shall publish, on a yearly basis, for each of the goods listed in Annex I, the aggregated emissions embedded in the imported goods.\n6 The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the infrastructure and specific processes and procedures of the CBAM registry, including the risk analysis referred to in Article 15, the electronic databases containing the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the data of the accounts in the CBAM registry referred to in Article 16, the transmission to the CBAM registry of the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CRAM certificates referred to in Article 20, and the cross-check of information referred to in Article 25(3).

        "pdf_text": "Feedback to “the draft implementing regulation about establishment of CBAM registry”\n1 Comments on the schedule of this implementing regulation and related matters (1) Regarding the use of the CBAM Operators Portal during the transitional period The “About this initiative” of the Commission’ s website says, “Tt will apply from January 2026 for CBAM reporting obligations” However, even during the transitional period, it is crucial for the third-country operators to be ensured the confidentiality of their own information, such as scrap ratios. Therefore, we request that the application period of this implementing regulation be brought forward so that “the CBAM Operator Portal” on Article 10 can be used by the operators even during the transitional period. (2) Regarding the registration details of each CBAM registry We seek detailed responses from the Commission, including specific examples, for the following; e Items to be registered in the CBAM Declarants Portal by the authorized CBAM declarants and the applicants who want to become authorized CBAM declarants as the registering entity. Items to be registered in the CBAM Operators Portal by the third-country operators the registering entity. 2 Article 10 “CBAM Operators Portal” (1) On Article 10, paragraph 2, it is stipulated that the CBAM Operators Portal shall be used by operators of installations for the following (a)-(c). In this context, the factsheet Information for non-EU producers of iron and steel published on October 31 states that third-country operators may provide information on their installations and the embedded emissions in the produced CBAM goods through the CBAM Operators Portal. Therefore, we request the commission to specify that those information can be registered on CBAM Operators Registry. (a) registering the information on that operator and on its installations; (b) registering information on the goods produced by an installation; (c) receiving notifications and communication related to their registration and use of information in the CBAM registry. (2) In addition to the above, we request that details be made public as soon as possible regarding what information is specifically subject to registration under Article 10, Paragraph 2, (a) and (b). (3) Regarding Article 10, paragraph 3 and 4, we understand the operators shall submit a request to the Commission through EU Access central service to obtain access the CBAM Operators Portal. In this context, we request the early publication of the specific request form and details of the EU Access central service. 3 Article 21 “Limitation of data access, data processing and confidentiality” paragraph , (1) Is it correct to understand that Article 21, paragraph 2 relates to the CBAM Operators Portal stipulated in Article 10? On Article 21, paragraph 2, it is stipulated that “The\nas\n2\noperators may access their personal data registered in the CBAM registry after their registration in the registry. Authorized CBAM declarants may access personal data registered by operators in the CBAM registry or otherwise processed those data, where authorization in that respect was granted by the operators” , so we understand that “the operators may access their personal data registered in the CBAM Operators Portal after their registration, but the authorized CBAM declarants cannot access the personal data of the operators registered in the CBAM Operators Portal, unless they have been granted authority by the operators” Is our understanding correct? We request a confirmation from the commission.\n(2) If (1) above is correct, we request that the Article 21, paragraph 2 be revised and added to clarify the relationship between Article 10 and Article 21, paragraph 2, such as by amending “CBAM registry” in Article 21, paragraph 2 to “CBAM Operators Portal” and specifying what “personal data” in Article 21, paragraph 2 refers to in Article 10, Paragraph 2 (a) and/or (b)."

While preserving the confidentiality of business sensitive information, a high degree of transparency of the CBAM Registry is indispensable for public scrutiny and input, which can lead to more robust and well-considered policies.\nAgainst this background, the signatories of this paper would like to highlight their serious concerns about the expected level of intransparency of the CBAM Registry, especially when compared with the EU ETS Registry. This is due to combination of the provisions of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as those of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956.\nAccording to the current CBAM legal framework (in particular article 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation and article 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956), de facto all information in the CBAM Registry will be deemed as confidential. The Commission would publish only an annual report on total aggregated emissions by CBAM good.\nOn the contrary, the EU ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013 (Annex IX) provides public access to most of the relevant information included in the registry, such as contact details of European installations as well as details on total emissions and free allocation for each installation. This high level of transparency is linked to the explicit reference of recital 28 of the ETS Registry Regulation to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. Instead, no reference to the same legislation is included in the Draft CBAM Registry Regulation.\nAgainst this background, the signatories urge EU institutions to revise the draft CBAM Registry Regulation as well as reviewing the relevant provisions of the basic CBAM Regulation in the context of the 2025 revision in order to ensure that the CBAM registry is as transparent as the EU ETS Registry. For instance, such consistency requires that contact details of CBAM declarants and third country operators as well as total emissions and total available CBAM certificates for each of them are made publicly accessible.\nAnnex: legal references\nArticle 14 of the basic CBAM Regulation 2023/956\n1 The Commission shall establish a CBAM registry of authorised CBAM declarants in the form of a standardised electronic database containing the data regarding the CBAM certificates of those authorised CBAM declarants. The Commission shall make the information in the CBAM registry available automatically and in real time to customs authorities and competent authorities.\n2 The CBAM registry referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain accounts with information about each authorised CBAM declarant, in particular:\n(a) the name, address and contact information of the authorised CBAM declarant:\n(b) the EORI number of the authorised CBAM declarant;\n(c) the CBAM account number;\n(d) the identification number, the sale price, the date of sale, and the date of surrender, repurchase or cancellation of CBAM certificates for each authorised CBAM declarant.\n3 The CBAM registry shall contain, in a separate section of the registry, the information about the operators and installations in third countries registered in accordance with Article 10(2).\n4 The information in the CBAM registry referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be confidential, with the exception of the names, addresses and contact information of the operators and the location of installations in third countries. An operator may choose not to have its name, address and contact information made accessible to the public. The public information in the CBAM registry shall be made accessible by the Commission in an interoperable format.\nas 2 The Commission shall publish, on a yearly basis, for each of the goods listed in Annex I, the aggregated emissions embedded in the imported goods.\n6 The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the infrastructure and specific processes and procedures of the CBAM registry, including the risk analysis referred to in Article 15, the electronic databases containing the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the data of the accounts in the CBAM registry referred to in Article 16, the transmission to the CBAM registry of the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CRAM certificates referred to in Article 20, and the cross-check of information referred to in Article 25(3). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2).\nArticle 21 of the draft CBAM Registry Regulation\nArticle 2]\nLimitation of data access, data processing and confidentiality\nAll information held in the CBAM registry shall be considered confidential. The authorised CBAM declarants and applicants may access personal data registered in the CBAM registry after their registration in the registry. The operators may access their personal data registered in the CBAM registry after their registration in the registry. Authorised CBAM declarants may access personal data registered by operators in the CBAM registry or otherwise processed those data, where authorisation in that respect was granted by the operators. The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the personal data and other data from Customs Import Declarations for goods not listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The Commission and the competent authorities may access and otherwise process the data from the EORI system, in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nRecital 6 of the ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013\n(6) The Union Registry should contain the accounts in which the processes and operations needed to apply the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC should be registered. Each account should be created in accordance with stan- dardised procedures to ensure the integrity of the registries system and public| access to information held in this system. Allowances should be issued in the Union Registry.\nRecital 28 of the ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013\n(28) In accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC (') and Decision 13/CMP.1, specific reports should be made public on a regular basis to ensure that the public has access to information held within the integrated system of regis- tries, subject to certain confidentiality requirements.\nDirective 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information (mentioned in recital 28 above)\nAnnex IX of ETS Registry Regulation 389/2013\nANNEX XIV\n\nL UNION REGISTRY INFORMATION RELATED TO THE UNION EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME\n\n\n(a) all information indicared as po be ‘displayed om the EUTL pubbc websiee in Tables DH of Annex OL, Table WH of Annex VI, and Table VI-I of Anmex VIL This information shall be updated every 24 hours:\n(Bb) allowance: allocated to individual account holders pursuant to Article 43 and Acticle 44.

The competent authority shall state the following in the communication to the applicant: (a) the intention of and the reasons for refusing to grant the status of authorised CBAM declarant; (b) the period within which the applicant can submit its observations.\n(3). The period referred to in point (b) of the second paragraph shall run from the date on which the competent authority notified the applicant of the communication and shall not exceed 30 calendar days.\nThe following might need clarification:\n1 What exactly do the “observations” indicate? Does this mean that authorized CBAM declarant will contact and confirm from the competent authority the reason for the refusal to grant the status of authorized CBAM declarant? Or does this mean that authorized CBAM declarant needs to provide some evidence or an explanation to the competent authority to overturn a denial of the authorization? It is unclear to us what is required in terms of submitting “observations”. Depending on the requirements (difficulties) for “observations”, 30 calendar days may be too\nshort. If the applicant simply needs to contact the competent authority, 30 calendar days\nwould be fine. But if the applicant is required to submit detail evidence or reasons to overturn\nthe denial, 30 calendar days seems too short for the applicant.\n(\\\nYEARS\n1991-2021\nEUROMOT aisbl\nA European Interest Representative - TVA BE 0599.830.578 - RPM Brussels\nEU Transparency Register Id.

An authorisation shall be registered in the CBAM registry in one of the following statuses: (a) ‘active’; (b) ‘revoked’.\n(2). Where a CBAM authorisation is revoked the CBAM account shall remain under the status ‘closed’ in accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 until the fifth year following the revocation. A ‘closed’ CBAM account shall be reopened by the competent authority allowing the owner to fulfil a obligation to surrender the correct number of CBAM certificates further to the review of a submitted CBAM declaration in accordance with Article 19(5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nThe following might also need to be clarified:\n1 What exactly does the status “closed” indicate? If the authorization of a CBAM declarant is revoked by the competent authority or by the applicant itself, does this mean that the CBAM account of the applicant will remain in the closed status for 5 years with past registration information (e.g. geographic information of CBAM declarant, operator and installations and declaration history etc.)? Does it indirectly mean that if an applicant of CBAM declaration wants to reopen their CBAM account again, the applicant can reopen the closed CBAM account within 5 years without having to create a newer CBAM account? What is the implication of the ‘closed’ status? Can we interpret it that ifa CBAM authorization of a declarant (importer) is revoked for some reasons by the authority, the importer cannot import any CBAM goods for 5 years because their CBAM account has been ‘closed’ and locked. Depending on the interpretation, five years may or may not be too be long to close a CBAM account.\nPRESIDENT\nDr Holger Lochmann\nGENERAL MANAGER Dr Peter Scherm\n(\\\nYEARS\n1991-2021\nEUROMOT aisbl\nA European Interest Representative - TVA BE 0599.830.578 - RPM Brussels EU Transparency Register Id.

First, in Article 41 (2) (b) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which guarantees the right to good governance, guarantees 'the right of every person to have access to his or her file’. It is therefore clear that the file must be kept in relation to the granting of the status of authorised CBAM declarant. At the same time, the recital of the CBAM Regulation emphasises the reduction of complexity and administrative burden. We request clarification as to whether the file will be kept/managed by the competent authorities in accordance with the procedures laid down in national law or whether the file will be kept directly in the CBAM registry. If the file is kept in the CBAM registry, will it be possible to add any annexes/documents to the file in the CBAM registry?\nArticle 2 (1)\nIt is not clear to us what is the role of the ‘national component’ or what it is intended to do. The term is used only in Article 15 (1). We believe that there will be no ‘national component’ in the CBAM registry, i.e. the Commission will be the owner and administrator of the system. We ask for an explanation.\nArticle 11 (3)\nIt is proposed in this paragraph that the CBAM registry will allow Member States to import and export data from the registry. Do we correctly understand this provision to mean that any data recorded in the CBAM registry can be exported from the CBAM registry by a Member State? For example, if an application is submitted for an authorisation in the CBAM registry, will the Member State be able to export all data from the CBAM registry and import it into its ‘national’ applications (probably the ‘national component’)? We ask for the CBAM registry to be able to export to Member States all relevant data that competent authorities objectively need for the exercise of their competence. It is also necessary for the CBAM registry to be able to export the entire file that is kept in each case. We consider this comment to be substantial.\nArticle 24 (2)\nAccording to article 24 the regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and it shall apply from 31 December 2024. These dates are not realistic because the direction should be agreed on by the Member States on December 12\" which means that it cannot be published before that date. This would mean that the regulation shall apply before being in force."

        "feedback": "1. Connectivity (Art. 9). It should be possible for external CBAM tools used by declarants to create CBAM declarations (and manage CBAM obligations) to submit these to the Registry using an API connection, rather than manual xml uploads. Many importers have CBAM obligations across multiple EORI numbers, and connecting their CBAM tool directly to the Registry would seriously reduce manual workload. This connectivity should extend to follow-up communications and status messages as well as any future communication regarding the number of CBAM Certificates held on a quarterly basis. 2. Emissions Database (Art. 10). The Operators database should be an open access database, accessible via a secure API. In a recent update on the TAXUD website it was suggested the data provided by Operators would only be accessible to Importers in the process of creating the CBAM Declaration within the Registry itself. Since many importers create their CBAM report in dedicated systems then upload to the Registry, the emissions data should be available to these systems as well. Currently, the XML upload process in the Transitional Registry requires the emissions data to be completely populated, otherwise the XML is rejected in its entirety. If emissions data stored in the Operators database within the Registry is only accessible when manually creating the Declaration in the Registry itself, the XML upload process is effectively cut off. Furthermore, there are also multiple upstream uses of this data, such as strategic sourcing decisions as well as simplifying the process of determining which suppliers need to be individually approached for data by the Importer. Hiding this data until the CBAM declaration process after year-end is an underutilization of this critical data. 3. Test Environment - Software providers should be given access to a test environment of the Registry. This was not the case for the Transitional Registry, complicating development of the XML message for upload and requiring software makers to use live environments of their customers for testing. 4. Helpdesk - There should be a dedicated Registry technical helpdesk on EU Commission level. The current set up whereby technical questions need to be raised via national helpdesks leads to delays in communication and misunderstandings. 5. Software working group - We would welcome the creation of a working group of software makers in the CBAM space, to provide feedback on development of the Registry and its interoperability with 3rd party software. This is commonplace on national level, in the Customs space and is mutually beneficial in supporting importers to be compliant effectively and efficiently. The same should apply for CBAM.",

        "feedback": "- Item 4 in the recital section describes that the CBAM registry should be interoperable with existing customs systems so that customs authorities can verify CBAM formalities during customs clearance. What CBAM formalities will the customs authorities check at the point of customs clearance? Is it simply making sure that the importer is an authorised CBAM declarant? or, are there additional checks? - Article 3(1) mentions the database will contain data elements of CBAM verifiers. Will verifiers play a role in the Registry? Or, what data on verifiers will be stored in the database? - Article 5(g) describes the requirement that the Registry is interoperable with the Transitional Registry. Is this for the purpose of migrating existing records from the Transitional Registry? or, does the Commission foresee the need for declarants to work with both Registries simultaneously? - Article 8(6) describes the possibility of delegating access to persons acting on their behalf. How will delegated access practically work? What specific requirements must a person that acquired delegated access by a declarant need to have? - Article 9(1) says that the CBAM Declarants Portal will be the unique entry point to the CBAM Registry for declarants. Does this mean that programmatic access, for example via an API is not being considered? We believe this would reduce the administrative burden by reducing the number of manual steps a declarant has to perform. Is that planned or can the Commission consider incorporating this as a feature? - Article 10 describes the CBAM Operators Portal and the functionality to register the information regarding the operator, installations and the goods produced at the installation. However, it does not describe how this data will be accessed by declarants. Is there more information on this? How will Operators interact with the Operator Portal?",

        "feedback": "Item 1 Currently its the importer or its indirect customs representative who adds information in the Cbam register about the operators and installations and their carbon exhaust. Suggestion would be made that operators and installations would need to add and update their own information in the Cbam administration where they receive a unique Cbam relation nr. This relation nr can be ventilated in onwards trading documents, f.e. invoices, where EU importers/Ind customs reps can use these for adding info in the Cbam register. Item 2 Same as above, operators and installations could add their carbon exhaust figures on their productions in the Cbam register already. Herewith importers and EU importers/Ind customs reps are able to re-use these data for filing the Cbam report, where they just add importation figures. Item 3 Would suggest for adding info into the Cbam report a simple excel upload would need to be used to prevent manual input at highest level. Item 4 Would suggest an indirect customs representative would get a different status for being liable and responsible for adding information in the Cbam register. A declarant receives its info from its business partners and customers and should not be held liable if the data is being reused in Cbam. Item 5 Currently when data is entered in the Cbam register it is not working very logical. When data is added in chronological entry, the view in the Cbam changes (and concept report) changes each time when information is being added. The Cbam program should hold the chronological entry of the importer or declarant. Item 6 Getting a download leads often to Cbam errors and prevent a user to be able to login for quite some days.",

This would avoid excessive red tape. Thanks",

        "feedback": "Hello Dear Madam/Sir We are reaching you about our inquiry on CBAMs financial impact. We, as Ford Otosan, have 2 manufacture plants which circulating goods to feed the manufacture lines in Turkey and Romania. Since Turkey is not in European Union it considered as we are importing products from a 3rd country during our import operations to Craiova plant. We have racks in scope of regulation which named as CBAM goods. Please see below more details about mentioned racks; -These racks are using only for packaging material to carry the actual products in themselves from Turkey to Romania. -Mentioned racks also dont have any commercial value and manufactured in past 2-10 years ago. -We dont manufacture new racks, but we use what we already have. (no additional manufacturing for racks for at least for 2 years) What we have problem about, the legislation indicates that if the CBAM good imported from a 3rd country (in our case from Turkey plant to Romania plant) the importer will face certain amount of certificate cost in tonne basis. However; -Non of the mentioned racks are new-produced so none of them leading further CO2 emission. -Ford Otosan Romania/Turkey use exact same rack during in&out processes which means we dont produce new racks each time. We use racks as packaging material with the ones we already have. Ford Otosan believes the commission thought notice that such scenario might occurs, and they developed a solution for companies as Ford Otosan. The regulation indicates if the companies declared the packaging materials (in our case it is rack) as they will remain in EU borders temporarily, they wont face any certificate cost. We, as Ford Otosan, planned to implement this suggestion however we cant link the physical operation to an ERP tracking system. The reason is, if the importer decides to use Temporary Admission to declare the goods wont remain in EU permanently the importer must link the temporary imported goods and their return to each other in order to report/declare it to the custom authority. Our racks have some numbers on themselves, but it is completely random and not all of them have mentioned numbers and the reason for them is we already had produced the racks way before the regulation was published. In addition, our racks are on common usage which means all of Ford Otosan Romania's suppliers have racks in their inventory and using them as packaging material for each shipment. Ford Otosan, calculated approximately cost with the current volume, will face certificate cost and will face higher costs in coming years although Ford Otosan doesnt lead CO2 emission and using the CBAM goods temporarily in EU borders. Ford Otosan, aims to invest more capabilities, employ more people, expand the manufacture line in our Romania plant however it is likely the total budget will cut by some share to cover CBAM certificate cost. It seems as only solution for Ford Otosan, is to implement the Temporary Admission as it is in Turkey which is based on total sum quantity, not based on labelling the good or a number for each item which is the subject of temporary admission. We kindly ask your feedback upon this inquiry and implementation of solution as more convenient way for Ford Otosan Romania. Thank you.",

        "feedback": "The correct functioning of the CBAM Regulation is based on the assumption that each Undertaking responsible for the PoM (Placing on the EU Market) of the substances/materials/supplies is actually using the correct tariff code to clearly identify them. This can't be any further removed from the truth, as the common practice of most Undertakings is to use \"generic\" tariff codes (i.e. \"parts of...\") instead of the correct ones. DG Taxud and competent Authorities of the Member States should start looking into the SAD using generic Tariff Codes (i.e. \"Parts of Air-Conditioning\" - 8415900099) and it will be easily spotted that screws, washers, bolts made of iron, steel, cast iron and aluminum panels (in scope of the CBAM Regulation) are incorrectly placed on the Market and therefore not included in the CBAM quarterly reporting. I invite DG Taxud and local Member State Authorities to take these these actions: 1. Break down these Generic Tariff Codes into [DG Taxud]: - \"Parts of ..... made of iron, steel, aluminum\" [in scope of CBAM Regulation] - \"Other parts of ..... NOT made of iron, steel aluminum\" [NOT in scope of CBAM Regulation] 2. Check the imports from October the 1st 2023 of these Generic Tariff Codes (i.e. 8415900099). I suspect the findings will be very interesting and will have also implications related to Regulation (EU) 573/2024 (the F-GAS Regulation). Another relevant topic is the \"Manufacturer Information\". There is a lot of confusion in affected sectors, as the \"Manufacturer\" is very often confused with the \"Vendor\". And likewise, the \"Country of Origin\" (were the goods are actually made) is confused with the \"Country of Shipping\" (Country from where the goods are shipped). Without levelling the playing field by securing that all Undertakings comply with the Customs Code of the Union in first instance, which would lead then to the correct application of the CBAM (and other environmental Regulations), there will always be a commercial disadvantage (Carbon Credit cost) for the law abiding Undertakings. If this is not done during the transition phase, any subsequent development of the CBAM Regulation will be hindered by the incorrect Customs procedures (by not using the right Tariff codes, CBAM obligations are eluded) currently in place. Truth to be told, this should have been done before implementing the Regulation. With these business operating standards (incorrect Tariff Code, incorrect Manufacturer information), after the illegal trade of refrigerants caused by the F-GAS Regulation and its lack of controls in its second release (Regulation EU 517/2014), there will be the avoidance of CBAM Regulation by exploiting the lack of market survey by competent Authorities. History repeating? Most likely, if certain measures are not put in place. Davide",
