We recommend a thorough review of the timelines to ensure a practicable and effective introduction of the authorization. A more feasible approach could include the following pillars: - For companies holding the status of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO), the application process to become a CBAM declarant should be significantly streamlined and simplified. This would considerably reduce the administrative burden for both enterprises and authorities and facilitate the overall implementation of CBAM. - Instead of introducing additional minimum threshold levels (as proposed by other respondents, e.g., based on import weights) for the declarant status, a swift adjustment of the overall CBAM De-Minimis is inevitable for the effectiveness and feasibility of the overall scheme.

We design, manufacture, and service transformative technologies to help take energy forward making it safer, cleaner, and more efficient for the people and the planet.

Across the EU, Norway and the UK, Baker Hughes employs approximately 17,000 people in engineering, manufacturing, and research and development roles. Having gained valuable insights during the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) reporting cycle, we would like to share our observations and recommendations in relation to the upcoming supplementary CBAM legislation. Additionally, we have provided comments on the future legislative steps regarding the requirements and the expansion of the EU CBAM. Recommendation: Clarify requirements related to guarantees. Chapter II of the draft Regulation outlines the conditions and procedures related to the status of an authorised CBAM declarant, including the requirement to register a guarantee in the CBAM registry. This guarantee is intended to cover the number of CBAM certificates that the declarant will be required to purchase in order to cover the carbon emissions embedded in imported goods. According to the draft Regulation, the amount of the guarantee will be determined by the competent authorities and is intended to ensure that companies have sufficient financial capacity to meet their CBAM obligations. While the draft Regulation provides detailed provisions on registering and adjusting guarantees, there remains an important question regarding whether companies are required to establish new guarantees specifically for CBAM or if existing guarantees (e.g., bank guarantees already in place for VAT or customs) can be used to meet these new obligations. At present, many companies already have bank guarantees which are common requirements in international trade. Given the similarities in financial guarantees for VAT and customs obligations, there is a question as to whether these existing guarantees can be used to satisfy the new CBAM requirements, or if companies will be expected to open entirely new guarantees. In light of the above considerations, we recommend that the European Commission clarifies whether companies are required to establish new bank guarantees solely for CBAM compliance or if existing guarantees (e.g., for VAT or customs) can be adjusted or repurposed to meet CBAM requirements.

EU importers must register with the relevant na-tional authorities in the respective EU member states in order to obtain the status of an authorised CBAM declarant. Without this status, EU importers will no longer be able to import CBAM goods from 2026. It is envisaged that the CBAM declarant will have to meet numerous criteria regarding their reliability. The process is complex. In addition, from 2026, the EU importer will have to participate in the trading of emission certificates. These requirements are intended to ensure that the CO2 border adjustment can be calculated accurately. The companies affected would like to see a more practical regulation that is clearly and simply formu-lated. It should also better account of the needs of SMEs and importers with few imports. Otherwise, CBAM could cause small companies to go out of business because the process is too bureaucratic and confusing. In particular, assuming that there will be (especially small) companies that need to import small shipments, such as special screws as spare parts, quickly and only once, without having the sta-tus of a CBAM registrant and will not continue to use it. For theses cases, a simplified process should be applicable: imports with payment according to standard values. This will not jeopardise Fit for 55 in any way. Importers with few imports should generally be able to choose between real values and standard values. For importers with few import shipments, registration (and participation in certificate trading, including settlement) causes a disproportionate amount of work. If these companies are not to be excluded from the import business, the admission process must be radically simplified. This could be done by not requiring companies with few shipments to register, but instead paying the border ad-justment at customs clearance upon import in the amount of the new standard values that have been determined. Ideally, companies would be given the option to choose which route to take. The introduction of the CBAM system from 2026 requires careful preparation. Although the period from January to December 2025 seems sufficient at first glance, time could be short. The DIHK calls on the Commission to closely monitor the authorisation procedures in the member states and to intervene if these procedures do not produce reliable results for companies. Provisional authorisa-tion should be possible in the next year for 2026, for Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs) and for new importers with a shortterm necessity of imports.",,withinfo,other,medium,closed,33194896,22400601191-42,,,

We have the following comments: 1. Delay in the Authorisation process: We encourage the Commission to consider what provisions will be made available to importers should they not receive authorised status from the competent authority (as set out in Articles 4 and 5 of the draft implementing regulation) by 1 January 2026. A timeline for final decision on authorisation would be welcome. 2. Development of IT-system and CBAM Registry: Noting the separate consultation relating to development of the CBAM Registry. We encourage the Commission to allow for the development of API connectivity for reporting by Authorised Declarants allowing for multi-country reporting for CBAM purposes and linking of Declarant accounts where suitable. 3. Record of CBAM Declarant during Transition period: We recommend that the Commission provides additional clarification on how CBAM Declarants and existing records will be considered as part of the application process for the authorisation of authorised declarants. This too applies the records of past CBAM Declarants into the CBAM Registry. 4. Definition of Authorised CBAM Declarant: Noting Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation 2023/956, we continue to note challenges relating to the issue of the definition of Authorised CBAM Declarant as it relates to indirect representatives acting as the CBAM Declarant for non-EU established importers in particular in relation to Article 1(c) of the draft implementing regulation. We foresee a challenge whereby most third-party indirect representatives will not accept the financial liability of CBAM Certificates while potentially impacting existing customs arrangements whereby multiple providers are used in different EU Member States for importing products into the EU and VAT compliance. We encourage the Commission to consider additional simplifications. We envision such simplifications could include: - Allow for a splitting of the importer of record purposes of Customs and VAT. We note that Article 5 of Regulation 2013/952 as incorporated in Article 3 of Regulation 2023/956 sets out the that the person liable for applying for the status of authorised CBAM declarant shall either be the customs declarant in its own name or the person in whose name such a declaration is lodged. This would allow for the possibility of a non-EU importer to appoint an EU subsidiary as importer for Customs and CBAM purposes while still remaining the person liable for the payment of the applicable VAT. - Based on existing EU mechanisms such as EU REACH and the designation of a single Only Representative across EU Member States for the purposes of ensuring compliance with relevant EU REACH obligations and the submission of necessary information and data. 5. Clarification of data request: We recommend additional clarification in the Annex to draft implementing regulation to specify whether the box relating to the EORI number refers to the indirect representative or the operator is required.

In view of the deadline of 1 January 2026, from which it is essential to be an ‘authorised CBAM declarant’ in order to import the products concerned, we have been surprised by the deadline for examining the application for authorisation, which seems to us to be very long (up to 150 or even 180 days). Would it be possible to put in place an accelerated authorisation procedure for operators who have already submitted full reports to the Court in 2024? Registered customs representatives, having largely been granted the status of “Authorised Economic Operator”, already have a high level of compliance with the criteria of absence of customs infringements and financial stability. Can a simplified procedure be put in place for those traders already enjoying trusted trader status, identified by their EORI number, in order to reduce the time taken to obtain the authorisation of ‘authorised declarant’? For large importers, we understand and support the need for an additional audit, but believe that the envisaged criterion of EUR 500 000 in value of CBAM certificates lacks objectivity as the value of CBAM certificates will vary according to the ETS market price. A criterion in tonnes of CO2 equivalent thus seems to us to be more objective and secure for businesses, as it is stable regardless of developments in the ETS market. Conversely, for operators importing small volumes, we consider it appropriate to relax the criteria for obtaining the status of ‘CBAM declarant’ so that they can maintain their activity on 1 January 2026.

The approach of Commission to CBAM in my opinion is a bit unprofessional and thoughtless. A insufficient amount of data has been provided, methodology has been awaited and obligations of payment are just around the corner. We in Croatia, and other EU bordering country have a lot of problems in understanding CBAM implementation for electricity (in my company case) and we do not have any feedback from Customs or EU in regards to that. Imposition of CBAM tax for which I can find understanding combined with energy market that is not developed fully and that is greatly divided from rest of the Europa thanks to very limited cross border capacity will result in great price deviations and potentially very expensive electrical energy. Beside that it is very likely that it will kill the electrical market in the East. Knowing that this is process that is beyond stopping please take all this factor into account and provide us sufficient date and time to prepare. I sincerely urge Commission to communicate in regards with CBAM more openly and to start providing all necessary data as soon as possible. We need one year of good testing of our declarations to see if the whole thing works. As mentioned, uncertainties, are great and we don not know who to address our questions. Expansion to this ambiguities create problems for our everyday operation. In regards to declaration of CBAM I strongly believe that more opened and explained approach is necessary. Workshops have to organized, official EU commission web page is very poor and does not provide enough data. Legislation and interpretation of CBAM could be widely wrongly interpreted because of this lack of information. A test register should be provided in order that we can check and learn about application of CBAM. Also electrical energy is terribly explained and we can not determine basic facts of what agreements (imports) have to be reported (do we have to have PPA for CBAM exclusion, how transit through non EU country should be reported, what about plain electrical trade transactions, etc.) CBAM is a huge monetary change for trade in all economical aspects. Please provide us sufficient information with practical explanations. And be aware that some countries are more exposed to this legislation than others and that is for them it is of crucial interest to prepare in time.

en,3498512,ITA,Arvedi Group,,PUBLISHED,2024-11-27 15:58:44,False,Ares(2024)7706795,False,,"There is in a significant risk for the CBAM effectiveness, if CBAM declarants are not sufficiently screened and controlled, and are allowed to make imports of CBAM goods for extended periods of time with emissions declarations that are lower than default values but without having received solid data from the manufacturers. In effect, in most cases the CBAM declarant will not have access to the data, or have the skills necessary to determine on their own whether actual emissions were calculated accurately. The only way for CBAM declarants to have any chance to be right about emissions lower than default value is if they receive emission data that comes from foreign manufacturers that have registered on the CBAM registry, and submitted third-party verified report. In accordance with Article 10 of the CBAM Regulation, installation operators in third countries can apply for registration, upload installation data, and submit emissions data via the CBAM Registry, which will open in January 2025. Operators in third countries who register and provide verified emission data via the CBAM Registry are likely to be more trustworthy in terms of quality of emission data since they are confident enough to share the information directly with the Commission. There is currently no obligation, no incentive even, under the CBAM Regulation for EU importers to make best efforts to import CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry. Thus, the draft Implementing Regulation does not directly include any wording on this. At the same time, we note that the draft IR provides in recital (10) that to ensure that only bona fide importers become authorised CBAM declarants, the competent authorities should make sure that the applicant has not been involved in a serious or repeated infringement of legislation including economic criminal offences, and that it has a good financial rating and provides detailed rules on criteria for granting the status of authorized CBAM declarant in Article 10 (serious or repeated infringements) and Article 11 (conditions for financial and operational capacity). We suggest the to amend Article 11.1(e), as indicated below. In addition, when the competent authority determines the revocation of the status of authorized CBAM declarants in accordance with Article 23 of the draft Implementing Regulation, the competent authority could consider the fact that that the authorized CBAM declarants made use of third country operators registered in the CBAM Registry as an indication of good faith to comply with CBAM obligations. Article 11.1 of the draft IR provides as follows: The criteria laid down in Article 17(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 shall be fulfilled where the following conditions are met: (a) the applicant is not subject to bankruptcy proceedings; (b) the applicant is not in arrears with the payment of customs duties, taxes or charges which are collected on or in connection with the import of goods, financial regulatory obligations and all other duties related to its economic activity; (c) the applicant demonstrates, on the basis of supporting documents provided together with the application, a sufficient financial standing to meet its obligations and fulfil commitments having regard to the type and volume of the economic activity performed by indicating the financial figures and any other financial information; (d) the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for fulfilment of the estimated obligations to surrender CBAM certificates, and has internal controls capable of preventing, detecting and correcting errors in CBAM declarations and CBAM certificates management, and of preventing and detecting illegal or any irregular transactions. (e) the applicant imports CBAM goods from third country operators who are registered to the CBAM Registry in accordance with Article 14 of the CBAM Regulation, where possible.",,anonymous,company,large,closed,33194896,,,,

AEOs sollten auch als CBAM-Declarant agieren können Unternehmen, die in der Europäischen Union ansässig und am Zollgeschehen beteiligt sind, können sich für den Status des Zugelassenen Wirtschaftsbeteiligten (AEO) qualifizieren. Der AEO-Status ist eine der größten Sicherheitsinitiativen weltweit. In Deutschland und der EU sind viele Wirtschaftsbeteiligte bereits als AEO zugelassen. Die Anforderungen an einen Autorisierten CBAM-Anmelder (authorised CBAM declarant) stellen einen kleinen Ausschnitt des AEO-Anforderungskatalogs dar. Im Hinblick auf die Reputation des Antragstellers werden beim CBAM-Deklaranten zusätzlich zu den Steuer- und Zollvergehen oder allgemeinen bedeutenden Gesetzesverletzungen auch die Verstöße gegen Marktmissbrauchsregeln und die CBAM-Verordnung selbst herangezogen. Abweichend von den AEO-Regeln, die einen Dreijahreszeitraum bestimmen, sollen bei CBAM 5 Jahre herangezogen werden. Der AEO-Status sollte bei der Autorisierung von CBAM-Anmeldern berücksichtigt werden. Dies wäre sowohl für die Unternehmen als auch für die nationalen zuständigen Behörden (NCA) in Bezug auf Vermeidung von Extraaufwand von Vorteil, da sich die vom Beantragenden zu liefernden Informationen zum größten Teil decken. AEOs sind verpflichtet, Veränderungen selbständig zu melden. Auch ist zu melden, falls es zu Problemen mit der gesetzeskonformen Handhabung des Zollprozesses kommt. Es wäre also in jedem Fall sinnvoll, wenn AEOs ohne zusätzliche Hürden als CBAM-Anmelder tätig sein könnten. Dies würde allen Beteiligten Zeit und Aufwand sparen, und die Unternehmen beweisen ja bereits gegenüber den Zollbehörden regelmäßig, dass sie als AEOs zuverlässig sind. Gleichzeitig würde es den Status des AEO für europäische Wirtschaftsbeteiligte attraktiver machen. Extrem knapper Zeitraum für die Autorisierung gravierende Probleme drohen Die Bearbeitungsfrist von 180 Tagen (incl. Rückfragen) erscheint sehr großzügig. Laut KOM soll das Portal erst in Q1 2025 verfügbar sein, also bis Ende März. Damit blieben also lediglich 3 Monate, in denen alle potenziellen Declarants den Status beantragen können/müssen, um gesichert eine Antwort (nicht notwendigerweise eine Zusage) vor Ende 2025 erhalten. Importeure von CBAM-Waren, die im Hinblick auf die Autorisierung erst später agieren (können), bekommen massive Probleme. Auch falls eine Gesellschaft erst später im nächsten Jahr neu gegründet würde (Differentiated Steering wird zu Neugründungen führen), wäre das sehr problematisch. Es braucht also auf jeden Fall noch eine Art Härtefall- oder Ausnahmeregel mit aufschiebender Wirkung, die die nachträgliche (nach 01.01.2026) Autorisierung ermöglicht, ohne dass es zu Unterbrechungen von Wertschöpfungsketten kommt, weil ab 01.01.2026 keine CBAM-Waren mehr eingeführt werden dürfen. Im aktuellen Entwurf sollte noch die Frage geklärt werden, welche unmittelbaren Abhängigkeiten zukünftig zwischen CBAM- Autorisierung und dem zollrechtlichen Status entstehen.

AEOS should also be able to act as CBAM declarant companies established in the European Union and involved in customs operations can qualify for the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO). AEO status is one of the largest security initiatives in the world. Many economic operators are already authorised as AEOs in Germany and the EU. The requirements for an authorised CBAM declarant are a small excerpt of the AEO Requirements Catalogue. With regard to the applicant’s reputation, in addition to tax and customs offences or general significant breaches of the law, the CBAM declarant also takes into account the breaches of market abuse rules and the CBAM Regulation itself. By way of derogation from the AEO rules, which define a three-year period, the CBAM shall be based on 5 years. AEO status should be taken into account when authorising CBAM declarants. This would be beneficial for both businesses and national competent authorities (NCAs) in terms of avoiding extra burden, as most of the information to be provided by the applicant coincides. AEOS are obliged to report changes independently. They must also be reported if problems arise with the customs process being handled in accordance with the law. It would therefore be useful in any case for AEOs to operate as CBAM declarants without any additional barriers. This would save time and effort for all involved, and companies already regularly prove to the customs authorities that they are reliable as AEOs. At the same time, it would make the status of AEO more attractive to European operators. Extremely tight time for authorisation threatens to cause serious problems. The deadline of 180 days (including queries) appears very generous. According to the Commission, the portal should only be available in Q1 2025, i.e. by the end of March. This would leave only 3 months, during which all potential declarants can/must apply for the status in order to secure a reply (not necessarily a commitment) before the end of 2025. Importers of CBAM goods who (may) act only later in terms of authorisation are facing massive problems. Even if a company were to be newly established later next year (differentiated steering will lead to start-ups), this would be very problematic. In any case, therefore, there is still a need for a kind of hardship or derogation rule with suspensive effect which allows subsequent authorisation (after 1.1.2026) without interruption of value chains, as CBAM goods may no longer be imported from 1 January 2026. The current draft should clarify what immediate dependencies will arise in the future between CBAM authorisation and customs status. Would companies lose their CBAM status if they breach AEO obligations and vice versa?",,

However, certain aspects of the draft Implementing Regulation require refinement to enhance clarity, fairness, and efficiency. Below, we present our consolidated recommendations. Firstly, Article 4(2) introduces the concepts of expert conclusions and third-party conclusions as tools for competent authorities to evaluate applications. However, these terms are not defined in the CBAM Regulation nor in the draft Implementing Regulation, creating uncertainty about the entities qualified to provide such conclusions and the criteria for their evaluation. We recommend explicitly defining these terms in the legal text or adding a recital to clarify which entities can provide such conclusions and their required qualifications. Secondly, the deadlines for assessing applications under Articles 4, 5, and 6 are complex and interlinked, potentially causing confusion for applicants. Article 4(1) provides a 120-calendar day deadline, Article 5(2) permits a 30-day extension if additional information is required, and Article 5(3) states the total assessment period cannot exceed 180 days. Additionally, Article 6 allows a period of up to 30 days for applicants to submit observations to a negative decision. The relationship between these provisions is unclear, especially regarding how extensions impact the overall timeline. We recommend revising the text to explicitly clarify how these deadlines interact, providing applicants with a clear and predictable timeline for application processing. Further, Article 6(3) grants competent authorities the discretion to set the period for submitting observations to a negative decision, with a maximum of 30 days. Without a minimum threshold, applicants could face unreasonably short periods, disadvantaging their ability to respond effectively. We suggest amending the text to include a minimum period of 15 calendar days, ensuring fairness while preserving flexibility. In addition, Article 11 outlines conditions for financial and operational capacity, requiring applicants to demonstrate their ability to fulfil obligations under the CBAM Regulation. For importers with Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, these requirements are redundant, as AEO certification already involves rigorous assessments of financial and operational reliability. We recommend exempting AEO-certified importers from demonstrating additional financial and operational capacity or, alternatively, recognising AEO status as a key factor during evaluations. This would streamline the process for trusted operators without compromising oversight. Finally, Article 14 requires applicants to provide a financial guarantee, which may impose an unnecessary burden on AEO-certified importers. Given the robust financial assessments integral to AEO certification, these importers should either be exempt from providing a guarantee or allowed to provide a reduced amount. This adjustment would balance administrative efficiency with the CBAMs regulatory objectives.

Die IHK Region Stuttgart unterstützt und berät staatliche Stellen in wirtschaftlichen Fragen und verleiht so der regionalen Wirtschaft eine wichtige Stimme. Das CBAM-System der EU sieht vor, dass ab 2026 nur zugelassene CBAM-Anmelder von CBAM betroffene Waren in die EU importieren können. Der vorgelegte Verordnungsentwurf legt die Rahmenbedingungen und Fristen für den Zulassungsprozess der in den jeweiligen Mitgliedsstaaten zuständigen Behörden fest. In folgenden Fällen erscheint der vorgesehene Zulassungsprozess als nicht sachgerecht: 1. Unternehmen mit wenigen Sendungen/kleinen Mengen: Die Auswertungen der bisherigen Importe von CBAM-Gütern hat gezeigt, dass 80 bis 90 Prozent der Importeure nur wenige Sendungen und/oder kleine Mengen importieren. Der in dieser Verordnung vorgeschlagene Zulassungsprozess orientiert sich aber offensichtlich an den Importeuren großer Mengen bzw. zahlreicher Sendungen. Weder dieser Prozess noch der Zertifikatehandel ist für die Mehrzahl der Importeure mit wenigen Sendungen wirtschaftlich darstellbar. Er belastet auch unnötig die zuständigen Genehmigungsbehörden. CBAM hat das Ziel eines Grenzausgleichs und nicht das Ziel, zusätzliche Hürden für Importeure zu schaffen. Für die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Importeure sollte eine alternative Methode zum Erheben des Grenzausgleichs geschaffen werden. 2. Verzögerungen im Zulassungsprozess: Was passiert, wenn ein Antrag auf Zulassung von der zuständigen Behörde nicht vor dem 1.1.2026 beschieden wird? Bei der Einführung eines neuen, unerprobten Verwaltungsverfahrens, das alle Importeure von CBAM-Gütern in der EU betrifft und das eine mehrmonatige Dauer vorsieht, ist es vorhersehbar, dass niemals alle Unternehmen rechtzeitig ihre Zulassung als CBAM-Melder erhalten werden. Zumindest muss dafür Vorsorge getroffen werden, dass diese Unternehmen weiterhin importieren können in Form einer vorläufigen Zulassung oder eines Alternativverfahrens. Ein Alternativverfahren für Unternehmen mit wenigen Sendungen entschärft dieses Problem automatisch, da deutlich weniger Zulassungen erforderlich sind. 3. Neue Importeure von CBAM-Waren: Auch ab 2026 werden EU-Unternehmen aus unterschiedlichen Gründen erstmals CBAM-Ware importieren. Ist es vor diesem Hintergrund angemessen und dient es der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der EU, einen Genehmigungsprozess mit einer mehrmonatigen Dauer vorzusehen, bevor man eine Packung Schrauben importieren kann? Auch für diese Fälle ist ein Alternativverfahren zur Zulassung als CBAM-Anmelder erforderlich. Wie kann nun ein Alternativprozess für die Erhebung des CO2-Grenzausgleichs aussehen? Wir schlagen vor, den Grenzausgleich im Rahmen der Importverzollung durch die Zollverwaltung zu erheben. Alle relevanten Angaben (Warennummer, Ursprung und Gewicht) liegen vor, für die Emissionswerte können die ab 2026 vorliegenden länderspezifischen Standardwerte verwendet werden. Das Alternativverfahren sollte allen Importeuren offenstehen. Die oben geschilderten Probleme würden damit verhindert. Unternehmen könnten selbst entscheiden, welches Verfahren für sie besser geeignet ist: Zulassung und Zertifikatehandel oder ein in manchen Fällen höherer CO2-Preis ohne zusätzlichen erheblichen Verwaltungsaufwand. Aufgrund der geschilderten absehbaren Probleme insbesondere für Unternehmen mit wenigen CBAM-Importsendungen oder geringen Mengen halten wir die Bereitstellung einer Alternative für den vorgesehenen Zulassungsprozess und den Zertifikatehandel für unabdingbar.",,withinfo,business_association,large,closed,33194896,,"The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) is one of Germany’s largest chambers.

The CCI provides support and advice to public authorities on economic matters, thus giving an important voice to the regional economy. The EU CBAM system provides that only authorised CBAM declarants will be able to import into the EU CBAM-affected goods as of 2026. The submitted draft Regulation sets out the framework and deadlines for the authorisation process of the competent authorities in the respective Member States. In the following cases, the envisaged authorisation process does not seem appropriate: 1. Companies with few consignments/small quantities: Analyses of past imports of CBAM goods have shown that between 80 and 90 % of importers import only a small number of consignments and/or small quantities. However, the authorisation process proposed in this Regulation is clearly based on importers of large quantities or numerous consignments. Neither this process nor the trading of certificates is economically feasible for the majority of importers with a small number of consignments. It also imposes unnecessary burdens on the competent licensing authorities. CBAM has the objective of border adjustment and not the objective of creating additional hurdles for importers. For the vast majority of importers, an alternative method of collecting border adjustment should be established. 2. Delays in the authorisation process: What happens if an application for authorisation is not decided by the competent authority before 1.1.2026? When introducing a new, untested administrative procedure covering all importers of CBAM goods in the EU, with a duration of several months, it is foreseeable that never all companies will receive their approval as CBAM reporters in a timely manner. At the very least, provision must be made for these undertakings to continue to import in the form of a provisional authorisation or an alternative procedure. An alternative procedure for companies with a small number of consignments automatically mitigates this problem by significantly reducing the need for authorisations. 3. New importers of CBAM goods: From 2026 onwards, EU companies will continue to import CBAM goods for the first time for different reasons. In this context, is it appropriate and is it for the EU’s competitiveness to provide for an authorisation process of several months before a pack can be imported? An alternative procedure to authorisation as a CBAM declarant is also required for these cases. What can be an alternative process for the CBAM? We propose that border adjustment be collected by the customs administration in the context of import customs clearance. All relevant information (product code, origin and weight) is available and emission values can be based on the country-specific default values available from 2026. The alternative procedure should be open to all importers. This would prevent the problems described above. Companies could decide for themselves which procedure is better suited to them: Authorisation and allowance trading or, in some cases, a higher carbon price without additional significant administrative burden. In view of the foreseeable problems described above, in particular for companies with few CBAM import consignments or small quantities, we consider it essential to provide an alternative to the envisaged authorisation process and certificate trading.",,

However, VDMA believes the CBAM mechanism still needs significant improvement in order to ensure both the competitiveness of European export-oriented companies in the mechanical engineering sector and to attain the desire climate-impact of the CBAM.

In more concrete points: 1. The implementing act lacks clarity on the absence of an assessment response by NCAs for an authorization request within the dedicated timeframe of 120 days. This would mean that companies would not be allowed to import goods in the absence of authorization. In Germany, the NCA did not respond to any individual request during the first year of CBAM implementation raising concerns for their fast reaction to further CBAM actions. 2. The timeframe of 120 days shall be shortened aiming to accelerate the whole process and to not jeopardize imports of goods in case of delay. Building on the commitment demonstrated by companies in prioritizing CBAM implementation, NCAs must expedite their efforts to ensure a more efficient and effective implementation of the mechanism. 3. With the goal of securing legal certainty, further clarification on the conditions under Art. 11. 1 (c) and (d) would be welcomed for better preparation for the application, less room for national interpretation and accelerated assessment by the NCA. 4.

en,3498322,BEL,Eurometaux,Nascimento,PUBLISHED,2024-11-26 16:33:29,False,Ares(2024)7706795,False,Bernardo,"Eurometaux's position paper attached provides the position and main recommendations of the non-ferrous metals industry on the Commissions draft Implementing Regulation on the conditions and procedures related to the status of authorised CBAM declarant. We support the Commissions goal of clarifying the criteria and processes required to become an authorised CBAM declarant, granting further rules and guiding details for both applicants and relevant Competent Authorities. In this context, this paper addresses the shortcomings of the draft text currently under public consultation, providing suggestions to improve the texts clarity and increase procedural certainty. We identified certain aspects of the draft Implementing Regulation that could be fine-tuned and thus provide the recommendations below: 1. Article 4(2) Definitions - In Article 4(2), points (a) and (b), respectively, refer to expert conclusions and third party conclusions, noting that conclusions by these entities may be considered by the relevant Competent Authorities to check if the criteria described in Article 17(2) of the CBAM Regulation are met. However, these terms are not defined in the draft text, nor in the CBAM Regulation. Recommendation: Give an indication of which entities can be categorised to fit within the concepts of expert and third party conclusions (e.g. by adding a new recital) to provide greater clarity and a more transparent authorisation process. 2. Deadlines for assessing applications - Several Articles in the draft text intertwine and ultimately impact the deadlines imposed on the Competent Authorities for assessing applications for authorised CBAM states: Article 4(1) states Competent Authorities are granted up to 120 calendar days to assess applications for authorised CBAM declarant status. Article 5(2) enables Competent Authorities to extend the deadlines set in Article 4(1) by up to 30 calendar days if they intend to request more information from the applicant. Article 5(3) notes that the assessment of an application for authorised CBAM declarant status where additional information is requested by the Competent Authority to the applicant cannot exceed 180 days from the date of reception of the application. Article 6(2) and (3), respectively state that Competent Authorities aiming to submit a negative decision to an application, must communicate to the applicant the reasons for refusing and provide a period of up to 30 calendar days for the applicant to submit observations. Recommendation: Clarify in the legal text the relationship between the derogations for extending the deadlines in order to provide more clarity for applicants. Importers or indirect customs representatives applying for authorised CBAM status should have a clear understanding of the application process, particularly considering the tight timeline until the effective start of the definitive period. 3. Period for submitting observations to a negative decision - The provisions in Article 6(2) and (3) provide the Competent Authority with the freedom to set up any length for the period in which the applicant can submit its observations to the Competent Authoritys communication on its intention to refuse granting status of authorised CBAM declarant, with a maximum of 30 calendar days. The current draft legal framework is unfair for applicants, considering that if a minimum threshold is not clearly spelled out in the legal text, the Competent Authorities will be allowed to set up extremely short periods for submitting observations, leading to a highly disfavourable scenario for applicants. Hence, the Competent Authority should also be bound by a minimum threshold for the period it sets up for the applicants observations.

In this consultation, we would like to raise the following points: 1. Fecc supports the initiative to authorise CBAM declarants to ensure compliance with CBAM regulations. However, the process must be clear and streamlined to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens. 2. The requirement for authorised declarants may disproportionately impact SMEs, potentially reducing their competitiveness due to the additional administrative and financial burdens. o The criteria for authorisation and the specific steps involved in the process are currently unclear. Detailed guidelines and support from the Commission would be beneficial. o The Commission could provide simplified procedures, financial support, and training programs to help SMEs navigate the authorisation process more efficiently. General Impact on SMEs 1. In the short-term, SMEs may face significant administrative burdens related to compliance and reporting. In the long-term, ongoing management of CBAM certificates and adherence to regulatory changes will require continuous effort and resources. 2. These changes may temporarily hinder SMEs ability to compete in the EU market due to increased costs and administrative requirements. However, with adequate support, SMEs can adapt and maintain their market position. 3. SMEs will need comprehensive training on the new CBAM requirements, including the use of the registry and management of certificates. Access to detailed guidelines and support from the Commission will be crucial. 4. Compliance costs are expected to rise, impacting SMEs financial performance. Additional resources will need to be allocated to manage these costs effectively. Transition Period Considerations 1. The absence of an IT tool and default values for performing and reporting calculations during the transition period will complicate the reporting process, potentially leading to errors and delays. Interim solutions or manual processes will be necessary, increasing the administrative burden. 2. Interim solutions such as simplified reporting templates, temporary financial support, and dedicated helplines would be beneficial. Additionally, clear communication from the Commission on expected timelines and requirements is essential. 3. SMEs expect to incur monetary losses due to increased compliance costs, potential delays in the import process, and the need for additional resources to manage the transition. The main factors contributing to these losses include the administrative burden and the cost of purchasing CBAM certificates. Fecc is the association that represents chemical, food, and active pharmaceutical ingredients distributors, most of which are SMEs. We believe that sustainability and an integral regulatory framework go hand-in-hand. Consistency between internal and external policies should be achieved to improve the international standing of the EU, strengthen the credibility of our values and actions, and most importantly, improve the protection of the environment globally.

The assessment period is excessively long and the AEO-like requirements lack proportionality, especially for low-volume/value importers. Our key concerns are: 1) Compliance Program Expectations: 1a) High Costs and Disproportionate Impact: Importers of minimal downstream CBAM products are required to establish costly AEO-level compliance programs. The financial and environmental impact of low-volume imports often does not justify such rigorous compliance. While art. 11(3) leaves room to consider the low volume nature of an applicant, the open ended phrasing leaves scope for discussion and national interpretation differences. 1b) Simplifications for AEO Applicants: We recommend providing significant simplifications for importers with AEO status due to overlapping compliance infrastructure requirements. It should be avoided that national emissions authorities re-assess the adequacy of customs compliance procedures that have already been audited as part of obtaining AEO status, especially since this subject matter is outside of their field of expertise. 1c) Implementation by Authorities: Unclear how national authorities will evaluate compliance programs, particularly the use of ""expert conclusions"" and ""third-party conclusions"" (Article 4(2)). Please clarify processes (involvement of customs authorities?) and ensure conclusions are transparent and appealable. 2) Thresholds and Simplifications: The Draft deploys 2 different standards seemingly intending to distinguish between high and lower impact importers, but neither is appropriately justified and how they interact is unclear. 2a) One-Tonne (Article 13): The rationale behind the ""one-tonne"" threshold is unclear and insufficiently justified. The terminology used in the preamble about not being engaged in cross-border activity is incongruous. Also; the threshold only impacts consultation timelines, offering limited simplification for low-impact importers. 2b) Monetary Value and Volume Standard: Ambiguity in Article 13 about the one tonne ""monetary value and volume"" thresholdclarify the use of ""AND"" as well as explain what the monetary value is intended to be here, the UOM ""tonne"" does not make sense for money. We point out that monetary value and weight have no direct relationship for downstream products; a combined dual standard will be impractical. 2c) 500,000 EUR Threshold (Article 11): Lack of clear justification for the 500,000 EUR distinction between high- and low-impact importers. Its relationship to the one-tonne threshold remains unexplained. 3) Timeline Concerns: 3a) Assessment Period (120180 Days) is excessive compared to customs procedures (typically 6090 days) and is not coupled with a timeline for issuing a final decision. The extended timelines exacerbate challenges for downstream importers, particularly with CBAM scope expansions or new product introductions. New entrants may require several months to align with CBAM authorized declarant requirements; when followed by >4 months approval process this may unjustifiably interfere with business operations.",,withinfo,company,micro,closed,33194896,,,,

One notable issue is the ambiguity surrounding the one-tonne threshold mentioned in the recital. The claim that importers of less than one tonne are ""not engaging in cross-border activity"" appears contradictory, as the act of importing inherently involves cross-border transactions. Further clarification is needed to explain this assertion and the rationale behind the threshold. Additionally, if this is intended to serve as a de minimis threshold for CBAM obligations, this should be explicitly stated and justified, given the relatively low financial impact of such imports. Another area of concern is the inconsistency between Article 9(2) and Article 21. While the former states that a CBAM account will remain closed for five years following revocation, the latter permits declarants to reapply for authorisation at any time. These provisions seem contradictory and require alignment to avoid confusion for businesses navigating these procedures. The regulation also introduces financial and administrative requirements for applicants, yet these lack detailed criteria. Article 11, for instance, mandates that companies demonstrate sufficient financial standing and have a suitable administrative organisation for compliance. However, the absence of clear standards leaves room for subjective interpretation, potentially disadvantaging smaller companies or those with streamlined operations. For example, companies importing large volumes of CBAM goods but operating with a small workforce may struggle to meet unclear expectations about administrative organisation. One solution could be to allow companies to externalise parts of the process, such as administrative oversight or compliance verification, to specialised third-party entities. This approach would ensure that companies, regardless of size, can meet CBAM requirements while focusing their internal resources on core operations. Similarly, the requirement for financial audits when obligations exceed EUR 500,000 (as outlined in Article 11.4) is vague, with the phrase ""where applicable"" needing more precise definition to ensure consistency. Furthermore, the treatment of non-compliance during the CBAM transitional period raises questions. While the regulation considers past infringements in the authorisation process, it does not clarify how transitional infractions, often resulting from initial uncertainties, will be weighed. A more explicit approach is necessary to ensure fairness for companies still adapting to these complex requirements.",,withinfo,ngo,small,closed,33194896,,,,

For example, Article 1 and Article 9 focus on establishing and managing the CBAM registry but do not address how it will interact with the existing Temporary Registry, leaving a significant gap in clarity for ongoing operations. Furthermore, Articles 5 and 11 emphasize financial solidity and the need for declarants to forecast their import values precisely, yet there is no clear mechanism for cost determination, and default values remain unavailable. This absence creates uncertainty for declarants trying to comply with the financial requirements. Additionally, the regulation does not mention Third Party Verification, which is critical for ensuring compliance, especially given the strict provisions in Articles 21 and 23 on the revocation of status. Without clear guidance on verification, declarants are left exposed to significant risks. Considering these omissions and ambiguities, the draft procedures seem to add complexity rather than simplify compliance for declarants and importers, potentially creating unnecessary administrative and operational challenges.",,withinfo,business_association,large,closed,33194896,,,,

It is not clear what this means. Doesnt the fact that these companies import goods mean that they engage in cross border activity? ---- One tonne seems to have been deemed a relevant threshold value, according to the point above, as well as the timelines specified for the consultation periods in Article 13. ---- Its unclear from this document how this threshold will be used. It seems to be a low threshold, considering the corresponding CBAM obligation would still be under EUR 300 per year. Is the Commission considering using this value as a potential new de minimis threshold? - Article 9(2) says that when a CBAM authorisation is revoked, the CBAM account will hold the status of closed for five years after the revocation. Article 21 says that a declarant whose authorisation has been revoked may reapply for an authorisation at any time. These two points sound contradictory. How can they re-apply if their CBAM account is to remain closed for 5 years? Could the Commission provide more clarity on this point? - Article 11.1 (c) requires the applicant to demonstrate that it has the financial capacity to comply with the regulation by reviewing their financial information. What specific criteria shall be used by NCAs to decide this? - Article 11.1 (d) requires that the applicant has an administrative organisation suitable for the fulfilment of the CBAM obligations. There are companies that import high volumes of CBAM goods, but have a small number of employees. What specific criteria will be used by the NCA to decide on this? - Article 11.4 says that if the estimated annual CBAM obligation is greater than EUR 500,000, the competent authority shall request the financial statement audit report, where applicable.

Communication channel between the commission and companies. Communication is not active enough. Mails should be sent out, or alerts, warning companies for any updates made on the portal or any new requirements. On my side, I keep digging in the commission's website to actually understand what is new. I discover docuements have been updated because I look into these docuements and note differences. 2. Indirect emissions calculation. This has been a big question mark on our side. Thinking our suppliers would need to calculate their own emissions, we trained them on the latter, built an internal simplified excel for the ones not responding (too small entities). We were very surprised during Q3 2024 reporting, the emissions were actually calculated automatically. You only ask for electricty consumption, energy source etc. Don't get me wrong this makes the process easier but we thought it would be way more detailed (also based on the excel the commision provided that was extremely complex). 3. Steps forward : we keep discovering things when reporting which makes a lot of stress and forth and back for us (central management of all our sites that do the reporting themselves). For instance, I've heard there would be a new status needed by 2025 (CBAM declarant status). Is this new ? How do we do ? We'd like to be ready. 4. CBAM portal : as of now the portal seems to have been updated. You are obviously not without know how difficult the processes were at the start. This should not happen in the official rollout of such a regulation. How can companies be motivated to actually fulfil and support these obligations of the process is such a hassle ? I hope these feedbacks can help. Best regards, Jeanne Parmentier",,withinfo,company,large,closed,33194896,,,,

One idea that I believe should be explored is to provide a simplified authorisation route for applicants as CBAM declarants which are also AEO certified. For example, the solvability criteria could be deemed to be fulfilled, together with the lack of serious infringements. This simplified access route is widely accepted across different type of authorisations required by the Union Customs Code, where some of the conditions are considered to be fulfilled by AEO certified companies. Going forward, it may be worth to offer discounts in the guarantee level required for CBAM declarants which are also AEO. For example, under Union Customs Code, AEO companies benefit of 30%, 70% or even 100% discounts in guarantee amounts required. This way of bringing together AEO with CBAM would increase the value of the AEO across the EU and would stimulate more companies to apply for the AEO status.",,withinfo,eu_citizen,,closed,33194896,,,,
