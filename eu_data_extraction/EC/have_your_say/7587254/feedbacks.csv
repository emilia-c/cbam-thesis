About us
NHO is Norway’s largest organisation for employers and the leading business lobbyist. Our current membership of 27,000 companies ranges from small family-owned businesses to multinational companies in all industrial sectors.
NHO strongly support the Paris agreement and the European vison of net-zero emission by 2050 and 1.5-degree policies. 
International trade and competition

A sensitive balance must be found on how to use trade as leverage for climate goals while not scaling back on the economic purpose of the trade agenda. Market integration is the core of what the EU/EEA is all about, peace through trade.

A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) requires serious consideration of feasibility, costs and risk. It is NHOs primary opinion that a CBAM should be considered as a last resort, if all other measures to mitigate carbon leakage for European business fail. A CBAM which is fit-for-purpose must be designed carefully and precisely in order to mitigate the risk of retaliation from large trade partners. 
Ideally, the move towards climate neutrality by economies should include the introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms worldwide. International business supports the net-zero vision but see little realism in this target without international carbon markets.

Alternatives to CBAM acceptable under current WTO regime, such as environmental standards, product declarations, labelling and the use of life-cycle assessments must not be underestimated as tools of competitiveness keeping production in Europe. The disclosure of production processes underlines and supports Europe's green competitive edge and if enforced in procurement would greatly lower imports of competing goods with more environmental footprint. 

CBAM design 
In order to implement CBAM one need a system to determine carbon content. That implies full transparency about of origin(s) and content(s) in all products, including recycled content and a legitimate system to calculate content and disclose emissions of production. Hence, the taxation must be based on the carbon content of primary and secondary production including both direct and indirect CO2-emissions along the whole value chain. Consequently, the design of a CBAM will be challenging and subject to many uncertainties although critical in order to ensure that the measure is fit-for-purpose and safeguarding against the risk of retaliation from trade partners. 

For NHO the following principles are imperative for a CBAM to contribute to EU ambitions of combing climate action with value creation: 

-	A CBAM design must be WTO-compliant, to safeguard against the risk of retaliatory measures from major trading partners harming European business and industry's global competitiveness.

-	A CBAM must be fully functional and compatible with EU ETS, and must not in any way weaken our well-functioning climate market. 

-	It is imperative that a CBAM is based on a finely tuned system to determine carbon content. This implies full transparency about of origin(s) and content(s) in all products, including recycled content and a legitimate system to calculate content and disclose emissions of production. 

-	Taxation must be based on the carbon content of primary and secondary production including both direct and indirect CO2-emissions along the whole value chain. 

Revenue from CBAM should be recycled back to business and industry, financing sustainability improvements which support the ambitions of EU climate policy, much like the principles of the Innovation Fund.

As an importer of cement clinker we understand the need to reduce the carbon footprint of the cement sector and to prevent excessive carbon leakage. As referenced in the “Carbon border adjustment mechanism Inception Impact Assessment” it is essential that the application is FAIR.  

If a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)  is to be implemented, the EU must ensure that importers are not paying more for carbon in comparison to local manufacturers.

If the CBAM is to be introduced alongside the EU ETS then the CBAM must be adjusted so the total price of carbon per tonne is not any higher than the local producer (competitor) is paying averaged over his total production including any credits (EU ETS) he receives.

Please see below a worked example 

•	EU ETS Credit 400,000 Tonnes 
•	Plant production = 500,000 Tonnes
•	Cost of Carbon to Plant = 100,000 Tonnes by 20 Euro = 2,000,000 Euro
	Avg cost of carbon per tonne of clinker produced = 2,000,000 / 500,000 = 4 Euro per tonne


A FAIR CBAM may be calculated as follows so the importer also pays a total of 4 Euro per tonne of a carbon tax .

Scenario 1, No carbon paid in source country which is outside the EU ETS
•	Importer pays 4 Euro per tonne CBAM which is the same cost of carbon per tonne as the local producer pays as calculated above

Scenario 2 , If carbon is paid in source country which is outside the EU ETS
•	Cost of clinker (sourced outside the EU) = 100 Euro per tonne.(this includes 2 Euro per tonne Carbon levy or tax or similar paid in source country.
If we use the total cost of carbon to be 4 Euro ( which is equal to the average cost the local producer pays for carbon in the example above)
Then the CBAM paid at point of entry to the EU should be 2 Euro so the total cost of Carbon on the imported clinker is 2 Euro (CBAM)  + 2 Euro (Carbon paid by producer in source country) = 4 euro and this is equal to what the local producer / competitor pays.

•	In order for the system to be FAIR and encourage all nations to properly account for carbon it is important that any carbon paid on the product outside the EU should be taken into consideration and be calculated as part of the CBAM. If this is not done then the importer would be unfairly penalized as they would be double paying for the carbon, first on the cost of the product (which includes an element of carbon and second by paying the CBAM.

BASF supports the Paris Agreement and sees climate protection as a key priority. Through our innovations, we contribute to the EU 2050 target of climate neutrality. While the required transformation of chemical value-chains will need political and regulatory support, we consider it highly important that relevant policy instruments are undergoing a diligent impact assessment. This impact assessment should not only include one instrument (CBAM) but compare this with improving existing instruments like the ETS as well as with developing new policy measures. Furthermore, it needs to consider not only the legal but political impact on recently strained trade relations.

Type of policy instrument
The impact assessment should seek a broad evaluation of policy tools, including optimizing and strengthening those available e.g. free allocation in the ETS and indirect costs compensation, but also explore new approaches and recent ideas e.g. carbon contracts for difference or other systems which allow for cost pass through.
In this context, an impact assessment should consider both scenarios: 
•	Protection is given, leading to increased cost for end consumers, but also for the industrial transition (steel, concrete for windmills or new low-carbon production plants …).
•	Limited protection due to green (allocated) imports resulting in lower consumer prices but a loss of competitiveness of energy intensive EU production.
Compliance with international treaties/law is a must. The assessment should encompass legal, political and economic feasibility aspects of the different policy measures, including their acceptance by 3rd countries. This is esp. important for a mostly net export sector like chemicals with its globally integrated complex value chains.
Also, exports need to be protected from carbon leakage. Effects of both, carbon costs and higher costs of carbon free production in the domestic as well as export markets, must be part of the impact analysis. EU-based productions must be able to compete on a level-playing field basis in all markets.

Methodological approach
Norms for disclosing the carbon content of a product have been developed, but they allow for substantial discretion in allocation, e.g. by weight or by value. They do not provide a clear number for each product beyond doubt and may be challenged by trading partners. Even with a globally harmonized political agreement on allocation rules, data containing confidential business information (CBI) needs to be shared for transparency/verification reason. Effectively protecting CBI must be part of considerations.

Sectoral scope
The Commission intends to evaluate sectors subject to a CBAM with a focus on sectors with the highest risk of carbon leakage. However, the complexity of chemical value chains means that a CBAM cannot sufficiently be assessed by only looking at basic products but must consider the impact on all its downstream subsectors. It is important to assess how a CBAM in an import oriented sector may lead to retaliation measures in an export oriented sector. This intersectoral connection must be adequately considered. A policy measure must ensure protection of all strategic EU sectors and value chains. 

Preliminary assessment of expected impacts
A positive impact of policy options on R&D and innovation to develop of low-carbon products will only be realized, if certain additional conditions are met. Developing breakthrough innovation for the production of low-carbon products will require additional financial support, which must, besides technology innovation support, also cover new applications and scale ups. It is therefore important that the assessment of a CBAM also includes the effects on clean-innovation production in the EU. The criteria of this assessment should be both protection and transformation of European industry. This will require including alternative instruments in the assessment.",,,anonymous,,,closed,7587254,

We believe that strengthening of climate actions by reducing carbon leakage is the main goal since the European Green Deal aims to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. We also see other important objectives, including the avoidance of social and economic harms, the limitation of legal and political risks, the minimisation of the administrative complexity and costs of avoiding carbon leakage.
Various trade-offs and challenges exist for the design options of a BCA or its alternative.
A BCA could target imports only, or both exports and imports. It could be added to existing or future free allocation or become a stand-alone anti-leakage measure for sectors at risk. Export rebates or (even more so) a combination of free allowances with export rebates could raise red flags, given that they do not serve climate protection and could qualify as prohibited subsidies under WTO rules. If there is no global carbon price, there is no uniform incentive to reduce emissions for both domestic consumption and production. An export rebate would necessitate a decision to create a level playing field for all European exporters on the international market or support low-carbon European exports only. Import adjustments, on the contrary, could potentially be designed WTO compatible.
If a BCA is to be implemented, the issue of how to calculate the carbon intensity of goods entering or leaving the EU needs to be addressed. This could be resolved by choosing default values for a sectorial average. Default values avoid trade discrimination but would not be fully accurate. A leakage risk remains. Full calculations can avoid leakage but are administratively very difficult. Default values would help in operating a BCA, if a BCA is applied to only a few sectors, given that data on production technologies across the EU exist. Third-party certification could be used by producers abroad that perform better than the EU average. A clear trade-off exists regarding the scope of a BCA. If it is broad, it avoids competitiveness impacts on downstream producers and material substitution effects. However, a broad scope results in high administrative burden and methodological clarity.
The different treatment of products with a carbon-intensity higher than the EU’s average could be at odds with the WTO law and the national treatment principle. It will depend on the details of the BCA design. The trade-off is between environmental effectiveness, which can be achieved by stringent and ambitious forms of discrimination under a BCA, and WTO legality, which is more easily achieved by less effective formulations.
The exemptions from a BCA for countries based on their climate policy actions would need agreement on criteria. Country-based exemptions are difficult to reconcile with the WTO principle of Most-Favoured Nation. Country-specific settings of the BCA would require scrutiny. Granting credits if there is carbon pricing in the country of export, however, is a key element of a BCA design. Such credits for non-price–based policies pose challenges in how to calculate them.
An alternative to border measures exists. By combining an emissions trading system with a consumption charge on carbon intensive materials, the ETS would continue to provide incentives for climate-friendly production of materials. The combination of free allocation of allowances with a consumption charge levied on carbon-intensive materials sold in the EU allows for a carbon price signal along the value chain and addresses leakage, while avoiding the complexities of trade-related measures.

If a European carbon border adjustment mechanism is to support energy-intensive industries on their transition to a low-carbon future rather than to simply protect them from a tilted playing field, the instrument should be structured in a way as to set the right incentives to innovate.

On the the one hand, the EU should use its existing research and funding frameworks (Horizon Europe, Innovation Fund, InvestEU, European Regional Development Fund, Connecting Europe Facility) to support research, demonstration and roll-out of low-carbon technologies such as CCS, electric or hydrogen furnaces or alternative building materials.

On the other hand, the CBAM proposal should include a ""sunset clause"", i.e. a fixed duration or at least transparent conditions for its phase-out, to signal that protection to European industries will only be temporary. Setting a fixed end date for the CBAM reduces the policy uncertainty that is currently delaying necessary investment into new production technologies in the cement, steel or aluminium industries. The ""stick"", or ""pull-factor"", of a phase-out on the horizon would complement the ""carrot"", or innovation push, provided by research funding, and unlock the creative capacities of European companies to enable them to become innovation leaders, as the European Green Deal envisions it. 

The CBAM could then be framed as a measure to accompany European industries in their transition rather than to protect them. The duration should consequently be based on expert assessment of the time necessary to transition to low-carbon production in key energy-intensive industries. 

In terms of political economy, a transparent end date or phase-out conditions would signal to industry that any delays in investment and any lobbying efforts to ease internal regulation would only harm their long-term viability in a post-CBAM world, and thereby avoid moral hazard. 

As a co-benefit, a time-limited CBAM would signal to the international community that EU intends to move to global carbon pricing without border adjustments in the long term. Several academic proposals in recent years (Cosbey et al., 2012; Mehling et al. 2019) foresee a sunset clause for this latter reason. ",,,withinfo,eu_citizen,,closed,7587254,

Bellona Europa commends the European Commission’s ongoing efforts to ensure that climate neutrality is met by 2050 and efforts to price Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. While the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) Mechanism could be an important tool ensuring that imports “reflect more accurately their carbon content”, it must be accompanied by an equally effective carbon price within the EU. With the CBA set to tackle carbon leakage, it must be acknowledged that current levels of carbon leakage are minimal, and any potential future threat hinges on increased asymmetries in global climate ambition levels and carbon prices. Although a CBA could be an important tool in such a context, incentivising global climate ambition levels, it cannot be seen as a silver bullet.
 
In the context of the EU ETS, a CBA is preferable to the current system of free allowances. It is important to note that free allowances cannot operate together or in conjunction with a CBA on the same products. It would either result in not being WTO compliant through double protection of domestic industry, or reduce its effect as any benefit derived from free allowances would also be extended to imports.
 
As the current threat of carbon leakage is minimal, free allowances under EU ETS are resulting in windfall profits rather than protecting against actual carbon leakage. As a result, the current system may in fact contribute to steering investments away from the EU, in particular from decarbonisation efforts. In the upcoming revision of the EU ETS, Bellona Europa strongly recommends that the European Commission complete a full phase-out of free allowances, introduce a price floor and ensure a strengthened and dynamic Market Stability Reserve (MSR) to account for market developments. Although a proposed CBA on imports can be an enabling tool for global climate ambition, it is not sufficient on its own.

A CBA mechanism must therefore be accompanied by a comprehensive policy package incentivising low carbon investments, production and consumption within the EU. This must include a portfolio of measures including market drivers for uptake of clean products. Bellona Europa urges the European Commission to include a thorough assessment of all available policy options and tools in the upcoming impact assessment, including the introduction of product standards. Above all, any CBA or policy influencing the treatment of imports must be for climate and not protectionism.
 
The aims below must be at the heart of any potential CBA for it to deliver. If not, a CBA on imports risks being nothing more than a vaguely disguised protectionist measure where global climate ambition and emission cuts are secondary targets.
 
1.       Encourage and incentivize third countries to increase climate ambition to access the European market. In turn reducing total global emissions and facilitate the development of low-carbon products and markets.
 
2.       Facilitate development of low-carbon products and markets in Europe, through sustained demand and predictability, for industries facing “like” cheaper carbon-intensive imports. In turn facilitating further sustainable investment and growth as outlined in the European Green Deal, and also in line with the “just transition for all”.

Lastly, a CBA must take “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” into account, and resulting revenue should be earmarked to reach set the aforementioned aims, with a particular focus on Least-Developed Countries (LDC).

a. Considering the necessity of a CBAM creation does not imply that CAN Europe agrees with the notion that our industry suffers from carbon leakage, as this is still largely unproven. If a CBAM is to be implemented  this would need to be complemented by an immediate and total cancellation of all free allowances currently distributed to high emitting industries in the ETS. Indeed, free allocations have resulted in windfall profits for industries and a distorted carbon price signal without addressing the fact that some imports of unrestricted products can undermine the overall EU climate protection effort.

b. CAN Europe support the concept of the externalities of products so that products reflect their ‘true costs’, including for goods imported into the EU. The EU’s inclusion of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in its European Green Deal and new Industrial Strategy shows the intentions of the European Commission to consider the design and implications of such a mechanism. As such, this could be a first step in ensuring that products (including those from outside the EU) reflect their truer costs by integrating at least a carbon price into a given product.

c. However, there is still a lack of data availability in the current international system to determine the carbon content of some products, including those of heavy industry, making it difficult to determine a payment value based on the carbon content of a given product. For an effective measure it would need to be designed and implemented in a way that balances environmental, trade law and fairness concerns. 

d. CBAM is one among many various measures that can be used to promote decarbonisation of industrial goods. Designing an efficient CBAM will be challenging and, being a measure amongst others, must not take up all policy development capacity.

e. A CBAM has both the potential, on the positive side, to pressure other countries to invest in putting in place industrial decarbonisation policies, as well as, on the negative side, to reduce other countries willingness to engage in multilateral cooperation as a CBAM might be seen as a unilateral initiative. The European Commission should investigate the potential impact of a CBAM on the international climate regime, as well as on the capacity of poorer countries to implement both the Sustainable Development Goals and the net-zero transition needed to implement the Paris Agreement.

RFF is an independent, nonprofit research institution in Washington, DC. Its mission is to improve environmental, energy, and natural resource decisions through impartial economic research and policy engagement. RFF is committed to being the most widely trusted source of research insights and policy solutions leading to a healthy environment and a thriving economy.

While RFF researchers are encouraged to offer their expertise to inform policy decisions, the views expressed here are those of the individual authors and may differ from those of other RFF experts, its officers, or its directors. RFF does not take positions on specific policy proposals.

Our comments derive from research with collaborators from Georgetown University to develop a published framework (attached) for WTO-compliant border tax adjustments (BTAs) in the context of a US upstream GHG tax. The effort involves extensive discussions with former US government officials, trade lawyers, associations and academics. 

Emission Measurements: Voluntary, international guidelines have been widely used for decades by firms in energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries to measure GHG emissions from facilities. Results are compatible with regulatory procedures that exist in many nations. More recently, voluntary guidelines have been developed to evaluate the GHG footprint of products. The challenge is to allocate emissions from facilities to the products they create. Our framework describes a Greenhouse Gas Index (GGI) as an administrative tool to evaluate BTAs based on a GHG tax. Products with GGI of at least 0.5 tonnes CO2e per tonne of product would be eligible for export rebates and subject to import charges. The threshold covers commodity products of major EITE industries. These approaches form a foundation to develop regulatory procedures for BTAs. The effort would benefit from public-private partnerships with industry and other stakeholders.

Export rebates: European manufacturers compete in both domestic and export markets with firms from nations with less stringent GHG controls. Both markets should be addressed to alleviate competitive damages and GHG leakage. CBAM should consider establishing rebates for domestic exports as well as charges on imports.

Challenges to WTO Compatibility:

•	Difficult and likely insurmountable barriers to WTO-compatible BTAs exist, if import charges are not based on a domestic tax on like products. BTAs that offset regulatory procedures such as the EU-ETS do not appear to be compatible with current WTO rules and practice. Even if they were compliant, such proposals face difficult methodological challenges to evaluate an “equivalent cost” to assign to imports. The ETS applies to facilities, not products, and its price setting process results in a variable not a fixed price. While methods described above might assist in translating the price from facilities to products, they do not provide a solution to the variable price.

•	The Most Favored Nation principle of WTO requires that import BTAs be assigned on the same basis for all nations. Import charges cannot be adjusted to provide credit for the various domestic policies of exporting nations. This is fortunate since objective methods do not exist to determine the equivalent price to assign to imports from the wide variety of nations that export to the EU with vastly different policy portfolios and stringency. 

Key points from our observations are: 1) methodologies exist that could provide a basis to assign GHG emissions from facilities to the GHG-intensive products that they produce, 2) without a domestic tax on GHG-intensive products it will be unlikely to create WTO compatible approaches to BTAs.

At the same, by failing to incentivize foreign producers to lower their emissions, ETS fails to achieve the key EU objective of lowering global emissions.

For these reasons, Grupa Azoty tentatively supports the idea of a CBAM, provided that (a) its main objective is to encourage non-EU producers to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, (b) EU carbon leakage avoidance schemes (mainly, free allowances) are not weakened, and (c) WTO compatibility is ensured by keeping the system non-discriminatory towards non-EU exporters, as close to ETS as possible, with solid reliance on GATT Article XX where required.

Grupa Azoty also believes that the fertilizer sector should be covered by the CBAM for the following reasons:

1. EU fertilizer producers have already made significant contribution to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions, by practically eliminating N2O emissions and approaching technological limits for CO2 process emissions from ammonia.
2. Our sector has clearly paid the price for ETS by suffering carbon-leakage: exports are down, imports are up, EU companies are taken-over by non-EU producers from countries with no carbon pricing, investment in EU production is down with most new investments made outside of the European Union (some of which are planned for exports to the EU).
3. Main competitors of the EU fertilizer industry come from countries that have no price on carbon emissions.
4. EU market is attractive for non-EU producers of fertilizers, hence introduction of CBAM will encourage 3rd country producers to limit their own emissions.
5. It is simple to calculate emissions in the fertilizer sector, because they occur in only two points of production and most of emissions are directly related to consumption of key raw material.
6. Most imports to the EU in our sector originate in a handful of countries, with a small number of producing exporters, making CBAM manageable at the border.

Grupa Azoty also welcomes the Commission’s decision to carry out a full Impact Assessment that will analyze the most important elements of the system. Considering the complicated interplay with ETS, WTO, and current plans to increase EU ambitions in terms of climate, an Impact Assessment is absolutely necessary.

If the Impact Assessment is to analyze individual sectors, Grupa Azoty calls on the Commission to include our sector – the fertilizer sector - in the Impact Assessment and stands ready and willing to provide the Commission with any required data.

In the attached document, Grupa Azoty lists a number of factors the Commission should investigate when designing CBAM and therefore should include in its Impact Assessment, including the main purpose of the measure, the definition of carbon leakage, relationship to free allowances, production vs. consumption emissions, the criteria to select the sectors to be covered by the measure, the type of the measure, variability of the amount of the levy, the possibility of imposing a two-level system, whether all countries or only some should be covered, whether transportation emissions should be included, and the form of payment of the levy.

We also believe that European companies are well positioned to be front runners in the green transition. 

While understanding the motive behind carbon border adjustment measures and agreeing with the objective to minimize carbon leakage, all kinds of border measures can result in unintended consequences.  

Carbon border measures introduced only on raw materials such as steel and aluminum would neither target nor affect other materials and goods produced outside the EU. This could result in making such materials and goods produced in Europe more expensive, and less favorable compared to imported goods.  

To create an unequal playing field for European industries and producers of materials and goods could result in increased risk of carbon leakage, and put European competitiveness and jobs at risk. 

Consequently, a thorough analysis of the implications of carbon border adjustment measures are needed to understand the impact on the European industry, to be able to introduce effective carbon reduction measures while respecting international trade obligations and promoting competitiveness of European corporations. 

In order to avoid that clean European production is moved to other parts of the world with less favorable energy mix and less strict environmental legislation. 
EU produced materials and goods may become less competitive both locally and internationally, while products from outside the EU would become more profitable, this could, in turn, add to the reasons to place manufacturing outside the EU. I.e., both taking jobs out of the EU and ultimately also leading to an increase in carbon emissions (i.e. carbon leakage). 

The main objective of a carbon border adjustment is of course to fight climate change by avoiding carbon leakage, but it must also be to keep a level playing field for all sectors. It is important that price increases on raw materials do not negatively impact firms further down the value chain. This could lead to carbon leakage in other sectors of the economy. The topic of unintended negative consequences further down in the value chain are complex and need to be thoroughly analyzed before introducing border adjustment measures.

Ensuring a sustainable supply of raw materials is crucial for Europe's industrial leadership and to achieve a climate neutral, resource efficient and competitive European economy. Large investments are needed in industrial transformation, and it is of major importance for economic, employment as well as environmental and climate reasons that European industry remains competitive in the green transition. The fact that a limitation and/or a price on CO2 is missing in important competitor countries outside the EU already has consequences for the Swedish mining, mineral and metal industries today in favor of more carbon intensive production outside the EU, which does not benefit the climate nor the European economy. 
Against this background, Svemin welcomes the fact that a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is further considered at EU level. However, the devil is in the details, and in this context Svemin would like to highlight certain key aspects that need to be addressed in the design of a CBAM:
 	Climate transition and competitiveness must go hand in hand. It is crucial that in the transition to become climate neutral, the industry can maintain and even improve competitiveness. A CBAM must be designed with the overall objective to contribute efficiently to reducing CO2 emissions in a way that is administratively manageable for companies and causes as little trade friction as possible.
 	It is crucial that the risk of carbon leakage for companies with export to third countries is addressed. The carbon and investment leakage that we already see today, i.e. that investments are prioritized in other countries with lower climate ambitions and higher CO2 emissions in production, must be addressed. This leakage is likely to increase over time if the EU increases its climate ambitions while other countries do not. Therefore, if the instrument of free allowances in the EU ETS is not compatible with a CBAM, another instrument that tackles the risk of carbon leakage must be developed.
 	The indirect costs for industry of a higher electricity price need to be taken into account. The mining and minerals industry in Sweden has adopted a roadmap in order to reach fossil-free mining operations by 2035 and climate neutral metals and mineral processing by 2045. In order to reach these climate targets, electrification is key. This requires access to fossil-free electricity at competitive prices. Svemin’s member companies are mainly established in the Nordic countries, with a very high degree of fossil free electricity. Due to the marginal cost pricing of electricity, the industry still pays the price of the coal, natural gas and oil in the system, even if the electricity is fossil free. The consequence is that switching from fossil fuels to fossil free electricity does not give any price incentives and competitive advantages for the first movers, but rather increased costs due to the increased electricity consumption that follows from moving away from fossil fuels and thus a competitive disadvantage compared to the slow movers. To get the incentives right to benefit the first movers, not punishing them, is crucial for the green transition and to achieve the EU climate targets. 
 	It is crucial that the existing system remain functional until another solution has been tested and proved effective. A temporary weakening of competitiveness can lead to non-reversible effects that have a negative impact on the economy, the environment and the climate.
 	Particular attention must be taken to ensure that no distorting effects are created between sectors and value chains in cases where different protection mechanisms would be applied to different sectors, e.g. free allocation of allowances for one sector and a CBAM for another.

Indeed, relying on trade policy (strong application of modernised TDIs, upscaling of tariffs in order to internalise carbon costs, adequacy mechanisms in FTAs...) would either be underwhelming or on the contrary trigger harsh reactions/retaliation; in any case any meaningful move would need bilateral/multilateral negotiations (by definition, painstakingly long). The fiscal pathway is politically/institutionally difficult due to unanimity rule but not totally blocked thanks to the passerelle clause established in the environment title of TFEU; however even in the hypothetical case of a Council green light, it would mean almost starting from scratch to define the tool, so the CBAM would come very late. Yet climate action is needed asap.
Which brings us to the ETS approach, ie inclusion of imports: ETS covers « only » a subset of industry, yet those sectors (steel, cement, chemicals, paper, glass...) are responsible for a large proportion of industrial emissions (EU and worldwide). Thanks to the benchmark system already in place, and given the fact that we're only dealing with ""simple"" products and semi-products, calculation of typical carbon footprint is not so complex. With regards to the WTO, a measure that applies to both imports and domestic products should be fully accepted as long as it does not discriminate against imports (« national treatment ») or against imports from particular countries (MFN). From that perspective it appears that moving to a CBAM would necessarily mean getting rid of the much-abused system of free allocation of allowances (currently in place to prevent carbon leakage risk), otherwise it would be a clear discrimination in favour of domestic production. And it would probably make it difficult to pick-and-chose impacted products according to their origin. In any case, and even though it should be possible to devise a prima facie WTO-compatible mechanism, there's always the second layer of argumentation under Article XX (general exceptions)...
A word of concern however with regards to the ETS as a whole (which explains why certain climate-minded stakeholders are reluctant to create a CBAM relying on it) : first it was demonstrated that the current parameters for Phase IV (especially LRF) are not in line with net-zero in 2050, and currently the Covid-19 crisis (and its consequences on industrial activities) shows that its market-based philosophy can run counter to its long-term goal goal (need of predictably rising CO2 price to change behaviours, but decrease of emissions = less demand of allowances = CO2 price going down). In order to end up with a credible, climatically ambitious and at the same time industrially fair system, an ETS-based CBAM cannot take place without an urgent fix of the ETS itself.

It is needed to achieve the long-term ambitions of EU climate policy while avoiding carbon leakage. CBA can also be seen as a temporary tool whereas the long-term target is to have a global price for carbon.
- CBA should be based on the whole carbon footprint which takes into account direct emissions, the emissions from electricity production as well as the emissions from the production of raw-materials. If this is not possible in the scoping of CBA, then EU should immediately start preparing standards to set limits for carbon footprint. The timing and products should be the same as for CBA.
- In the transition towards global climate neutrality, CBA needs to complement the current for carbon leakage preventing measures in the Emission Trading System, i.e. free allocation and compensation for indirect costs.

The EU aims to be a global leader for the EU leadership in the global climate change mitigation. At the same time global emissions continue to grow. As long as there is no international binding agreement with a global carbon price of carbon, there is a need to reduce the risk for carbon leakage. 

Carbon leakage is evident in the steel market where imports of stainless steel now account for more than 30% of the European steel consumption. At the same time, the steel produced in Asia creates up-to 5 times higher CO2 emissions compared to European producers’ emissions. Avoiding the risk of carbon leakage is a pre-condition for preserving the environmental integrity of EU climate policy and industrial competitiveness.

EU ETS free allocation and indirect compensation are designed mainly to address the risk of production relocation, thus tackling the carbon leakage only partly. Carbon border measure can be an effective instrument to address structurally the emissions embedded in the imported products if it takes into account the total carbon footprint. The preparation of carbon border adjustment should start with the most vulnerable sectors, such as steel.

Carbon Border Adjustment must include the whole carbon footprint to be effective

For stainless steel, a significant part of the product CO2 footprint is typically attributed to scope 3. Thus, it is crucial that carbon border adjustment mechanism takes into account the whole carbon footprint. If this is not possible, then the EU needs to set limit values for product carbon footprint. The time-schedule and scoping should be the same as for carbon border adjustment

Reporting and measurement of carbon emissions as part of CBA

The data submitted by producers should be measured and reported according to a specified protocol and there should be a verification by a third party. The EU should define a standard for the calculation of the total carbon footprint. It would also be possible to use international standards, for example for life cycle assessment.

The current carbon leakage measures are still needed

Until the EU has a comprehensive CBA mechanism and enough experience of its functionality, the current tools to reduce the risk for carbon leakage, i.e. free allocation, and indirect compensation, are essential. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. Even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. This divergence will further increase in the future.

Currently, EURACOAL has not reached a position on a CBA mechanism. We await concrete proposals, but offer some initial views here in our response paper.

1. A global carbon emissions trading system – the ideal solution
Before considering other options, we suggest that the European Commission’s highest priority should be a diplomatic effort to engage with the world’s top carbon emitters – say the G20 countries – to agree an international carbon trading system. With such a system in place, the carbon-leakage issue would disappear as each nation would face a common carbon price. We note that this was also the stated intent of Article 6 in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement which came into effect at the beginning of 2020 and which EURACOAL supports.

2. Scope of a CBA mechanism
To grant carbon-leakage protection to selected sectors is a market distortion. Other similar but competing sectors, would be disadvantaged. For example, steel, aluminium, cement (concrete), timber and plastics are often interchangeable in construction and product design. It would be a market distortion if EU officials had the power to assess the carbon penalties applied to particular materials for two reasons. Firstly, such assessments could never be “correct” as there is no perfect way to calculate embedded carbon emissions. Secondly, the Commission proposes to apply a CBA only to “selected sectors” which would effectively determine the market competitiveness of selected materials. Any mechanism should cover all sectors of the economy, including the electricity sector which the Commission acknowledges is threatened by imports from countries that do not participate in the EU ETS.

3. GHG emissions associated with imported products
The Commission is exploring how assessments of the embedded carbon in imported products should be carried out by analysing and inspecting production facilities in third countries. It would be impossible for the EU to carry out such activities on foreign territories where it has no jurisdiction. The Commission would therefore have to fall back on assumed values for the carbon emissions associated with particular processes. Instead of a level playing field, it would penalise some at the expense of others and have unverifiable and uncertain environmental outcomes. These complexities point to the need for a simpler, more transparent, fairer approach.

4. Carbon trade wars
Any imposition by the EU of a CBA mechanism would inevitably lead to a trade war with third countries. Other countries would view a CBA as protectionism. It is for the EU to decide if it wants to take this approach to trade, but EURACOAL itself has always championed open and transparent markets with fair competition on a level playing field, the international coal trade market being an excellent example. Of greater concern to EURACOAL today is the import of coal from countries where production is subsidised which competes unfairly against unsubsidised EU producers.

5. A universal carbon border adjustment mechanism
A simpler approach should be considered, one that is not subject to arbitrary decisions made with imperfect knowledge. The EU could elect to impose a carbon border tariff on the totality of its international trade. This can be done by taking the value of any particular trade and imposing a tax based on the overall CO2 or GHG emissions per unit of GDP of the trading partner. No new administration is needed as the carbon tariffs could be added to existing tariffs collected through existing customs arrangements. The rate of carbon tariff (tCO2e), would have to be set unilaterally by the EU or by multi-lateral agreement.

According to the Inception impact assessment document, CBAM alternatives seem to apply only to imports into the EU, for purposes of maintaining competitiveness of the EU-Based industry in the internal market. However, Repsol considers that any CBAM measures should also provide effective carbon leakage protection for the European companies exporting abroad EU so that CBAM will play sideways: imports and exports.

•	European economy competitiveness shall continue to be a key goal for EU policy, being strictly linked to employment levels and, in general, to the overall internal wealth. In this perspective, measures aimed at safeguarding the competitiveness of European industries are imperative, especially if directed to offset the effects of an increased cost of production linked to choices aimed at fostering the energy transition towards a low carbon economy.

•	A mechanism to reduce the risk of carbon leakage as well as EU industries being less competitive due to higher energy costs is therefore deemed as an appropriate measure bringing together also valuable economic and social impacts. Indeed, production activities set up (or relocated) outside Europe only for exploiting lower energy costs for the absence of negative externalities correction mechanisms (e.g. Emission Trading System or other arrangements in the EU framework, such as Energy Taxation Directive) determine a net adverse environmental balance at global level.

•	European industry is characterised by a top-class energy system for reasons linked to both technological and legislative evolutions. Such a competitive advantage should not be undermined by the introduction of the virtuous legislative provisions envisaged under the new EU Green Deal aimed at safeguarding the environment. In this perspective, a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” could defend EU economy on the one side against delocalisation choices and on the other side from competition against goods produced at lower costs by using more polluting fuels. This would have a double negative effect: on society, for the loss of local employments and skills, and on environment, since the overall pollutants level is not reduced, being GHG emitted elsewhere in the atmosphere.

•	Additionally, we share the view that a “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” would contribute to the enhancement of the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) diffusion both in and outside Europe. In particular, a well-designed and properly implemented adjustment scheme could prevent obstacles in the development of renewable gases technologies and the whole supply chain needed to support the energy transition (biomethane and hydrogen newly-born European sectors), that could be endangered by distortive/unfavourable competitive conditions.

•	The “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” should be also designed to consider the effects of the policy decisions on export goods in order to keep the competitiveness of EU industries at global level. In this respect, if an increase in costs for imported goods produced with more polluting fuels will be put in place,  equally also a “discount” for exported goods have to be envisaged if those products are produced with low carbon and/or renewable sources (such as biomethane, syngas, hydrogen and abated natural gas).

•	When designing the legislative measures establishing the Mechanism, a correct link with EU Emission Trading System and Energy Taxation Directive should be ensured to adequately reflect in the imported products prices the cost of carbon as well as the different taxation levels applied to energy sources according to their environmental and social impacts.

The Roadmap for a Directive on a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism names several requirements for
such policy. It is expected to ensure that the “price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content”. It
also states that “the complementarity of the measure with internal carbon pricing, in particular the EU ETS,
will also have to be assessed, as well as how it relates to the current measures to avoid the risk of carbon
leakage. […] The measure should be commensurate with the internal EU carbon price. Against the background
of these policy objectives, EEX sees the following key principles for the design of a carbon border adjustment
mechanism should it be implemented:

Key principles for a carbon border adjustment mechanism

A carbon border adjustment mechanism should be as closely as possible integrated with the existing EU
Emissions Trading Scheme. The most straightforward way to do this would be the inclusion of imports in the
EU ETS as listed as an option in the inception impact assessment. Importers would be required to surrender
EU Emission Allowances for goods which they import to the EU. This policy approach has several significant
advantages over alternatives, such as an import tax/tariff or product standards:

 An inclusion of imports in the EU ETS would ensure full compatibility with carbon pricing in the EU and
the existing energy and climate policy framework. The existing infrastructure of the EU ETS could be
used for implementation.

 The price importers pay would be fully transparent and equal to what EU producers are paying,
providing a clear and easily comparable measure for their efforts. They could rely on the liquid and
efficient EU emission market to manage their exposure.

 Inclusion in the EU ETS provides an optimal basis for increasing cooperation between jurisdictions.
Other regions would be encouraged to monitor and track emissions in line with the EU ETS, increasing
compatibility between different climate policy regimes globally.

The introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism for a sector has to be linked to a gradual phaseout
of free allocation. The policy objective of such mechanism is to provide an alternative to free allocation
and counter some its disadvantages. For reducing administrative complexity, any mechanism should use
existing standards, infrastructure and common EU benchmarks already used today for policies to limit carbon
leakage.

A decrease in free allocation has to be matched with an increase in the auctioning share. Auctioning is the
default allocation method for allowances in the EU ETS. It is the most transparent allocation method,
providing a transparent, harmonised and non-discriminatory process. The principle of auctioning, and the
objective of gradually moving to full auctioning, is fundamental to the objective of emissions trading as it
guarantees costs of carbon are internalized. Auctioning revenues make a significant contribution to climate
action in Europe. In 2018, revenues for the EU’s Common Auction Platform alone amounted to more than 14
billion Euros. Member States spent or planned to spend close to 70% of these revenues for specified climate
and energy related purposes over the course of the year1.",,09579576238-53,withinfo,company,large,closed,7587254,

This summary is expanded upon in Ember’s attached report; and ClientEarth’s and Ember’s joint attached briefing, both of which form part of our submission.
Scope of the CBAM 

The main objective of the CBAM is to fight climate change by tackling carbon leakage. The measure will be more effective if it captures leakage of GHGs such as methane. Therefore, we suggest replacing the term “carbon” with a broader term such as “emissions” or “GHG”. 

Existing and new methodologies should evolve where possible to capture GHGs. The CBAM should seek ways to overcome administrative burden and include measures that guarantee “ancillary verifications, controls and audits of installations in third countries” per the roadmap.  

The CBAM should be assessed:
•	As an alternative to the measures in the ETS that aim to address carbon leakage. Hence, it may nullify the need free allowances and indirect cost compensation if designed so as to ensure a level playing field between EU industries and their non-EU counterparts in relation to the price of carbon-intensive goods imported to the EU. 
•	To ensure compatibility with the Energy Taxation Directive under revision. 
•	In light of the New Industrial Strategy for Europe and the announced White Paper on an Instrument on Foreign Subsidies, as well as the update of the Industrial Emissions Directive.

A CBAM can be compatible with WTO rules, for example Article II.2 or Article III.2 of the GATT. In any case, the CBAM could be justified under Article XX of the GATT exemption, and more specifically for the reasons described in paragraphs b (allowing measures for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health) and/or g (allowing measures for the conservation of exhaustible natural resources). As the CBAM objective is to combat climate change rather than to favour EU domestic products and services over foreign ones, it can be designed in a way not to constitute an arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.

Application
The measure should apply in the following areas of the energy sector: 
•	Trade of electricity through interconnectors
Electricity imported to the EU from non-EU countries through interconnectors is not subject to carbon pricing, and is often sourced from carbon-intensive power plants (e.g. Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Turkey, Morocco, Ukraine). Research by Ember shows that carbon leakage in electricity is already occurring, and a CBAM could be the only effective way to avoid this leakage. 
•	Fossil fuel imports to the EU
The EU’s importing of coal, fossil gas, LNG and oil involves significant risk of leakage given the emissions intensity of extracting, processing, storing and transporting those materials. Such emissions may not be properly accounted for due to lack of adequate legal climate frameworks, and so could cause GHG leakage.  The Commission should ensure the CBAM properly accounts for the emissions involved in these imports.

Form
The roadmap and Ember in its report suggest several options for the mechanism. The choice of the most suitable and effective form should be based on compatibility with WTO rules, timing of the mechanism, adaptability and effectiveness. 

Legal basis and instrument
As the main purpose of the measure is to combat climate change, Article 192 of the TFEU seems to provide a more suitable legal basis than Article 207. To safeguard a higher level of harmonisation and coordination in a complex area, a regulation is preferred over a directive.

Final remarks
The CBAM will link to various areas of EU policy and legislation. We strongly recommend the CBAM is adopted through a transparent, close and meaningful cooperation with DG TAXUD with DGs CLIMA, TRADE, ENER,  COMP and ENV.     
Finally, ClientEarth and Ember should be included in the specialised audience, which will participate in the more technical consultation.

Legal basis

It is yet not clear whether this mechanism be proposed under a tax regime or in the form of customs duties. Clarity on this matter is necessary as this has a bearing on the legal basis, the delimitation of competences as established in the treaties and the decision making process (unanimity in the case of taxation).  

International framework

The future impact assessment should investigate whether a proposed directive is compliant under the World Trade Organisation framework. Taxation on imported goods (other than customs duties/charges which are bound by WTO GATT) for any specific policy objective, are subject to National Treatment basis – in short, the measure cannot discriminate against foreign products. This seems to be the thinking in the inception impact assessment document. However, this also raises other considerations on how to design / administer such an instrument so as to avoid a burdensome instrument, ensure its efficient enforcement and prevent fraudulent practices by exporters / importers of covered goods.  

Economic/trade analysis

According to the attached NSO data, imports in MT from third countries (including the UK because of BREXIT, but excluding Switzerland and ships and aircraft storage) result to Euro 3.79 billion (grand total 7318.1, less shipment & aircraft 0.2, less EFTA 58.7, less EU 4821.5, plus UK BREXIT 1352.9).  The sectors are found on page 5 of the attached NSO press release.  The Commission is yet to disclose the sectors it intends proposing to be subject to the carbon border adjustment mechanism.  It is important that the impact assessment would investigate whether importation from third countries could be easily substituted at a justifiable cost from importation from within the EU (excluding the UK, post BREXIT).

The impact assessment does not dwell on whom to attribute the calculation of carbon emissions on each product.  Is it up to the exporter, customs etc to calculate emissions? More details would be required so that an appropriate assessment may be prepared.  

Mandatory analysis in conjunction with each Member State

The impact assessment from the Commission calls for the competitivity of the single market as a whole vis a vis third countries.  Malta reiterates that the single market is comprised of different Member States’ economies, some of which, as in the case of Malta with inherent specificities.  Limited land resources, dependence on imported energy supplies and double insularity, lead to dependence on imports to sustain both economic and social welfare such that the Maltese economy ranks amongst the most open economies in the world. Such particularities give a different character to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the Maltese context since it risks rendering uncompetitive goods and services that are produced in Malta.  

Insofar, a one size fits all carbon border adjustment mechanism, which does not address these inherit particularities, would fall short from creating a harmonised single market, but de facto would allow for severe competitive distortions between Member States.  In other words, there is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals, and would contradict cohesion policy within the Single Market.  

Though upholding the Paris Agreement is noble in its own right, the Commission ought to study whether the proposed mechanism is proportionate to the likely economic disruption of Member States, heavily dependant on importation, and whether the shift from third country imports to EU imports is viable from an economic perspective. Furthermore, the proposal needs also to be studied from a distributional perspective, particularly assessing the impact of higher import prices on more vulnerable groups in society.

The EU should pursue an ambitious implementation of the European Green Deal, including the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and a package of enhanced policies and measures to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. At the international level, the EU should continue cooperating towards an effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments in other countries, thus enhancing the global response to climate change while also reducing the risk of carbon leakage
•	The risk of carbon leakage needs to be addressed with existing and new instruments, aiming in the first place at maximizing global climate protection while safeguarding EU competitiveness. An ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement by all Countries is the most effective way to reduce GHG emissions. While comparable carbon constraints are not in place and an actual risk of carbon leakage exists, the effectiveness of enhancing existing measures should be assessed and compared with possible alternative solutions such as a Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA).  The assessment should include evaluating the impacts both at sector/product level and at EU level, taking especially into account those global technological supply chains most critical to the energy transition, such as renewable energy technologies and batteries
•	A CBA should focus only on imports in order to maximize the legal compatibility with international treaties such as WTO and UNCCC.  The design and scope of the CBA should be consistent with non-discriminatory principles of trade treaties and with UNFCCC principles, which foresee more responsibility and efforts by developed Countries compared with developing ones. Applying the CBA only to imports is more likely to be compatible with WTO rules. Its application also to exports, while increasing its overall mitigation impact, makes it more questionable from a trade perspective  
•	The choice and design of the policy instrument should consider its technical, market and political feasibility. Options could include a carbon tax on selected products – both on imported and domestic products, a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports, or the extension of the EU ETS to imports. Extending EU ETS to imports would maximize the overall feasibility of a CBA, simplifying its technical implementation, minimizing market distortions, favoring political adoption at EU level and easing discussions at international level, as the type of instrument and the level of carbon constraints applied to imports would be aligned with the EU domestic approach 
•	The possible adoption of a CBA should be considered together with a phase out of free allocation for the same sectors or products in order to be compatible with WTO rules.  The CBA should be applied to all imports in terms of import fees.  In order to avoid duplication and be compatible with WTO rules, its implementation would require the phasing out of the current regime of free allocation
•	To overcome the technical challenges a staged approach should be tested characterized by increasing levels of accuracies. The starting stage would apply to imports country specific carbon border taxes based on simplified estimates of national carbon intensity. Later stages, triggered by bilateral agreements, would involve using certified exporting country generated data to review the country specific taxes and/or develop sector specific carbon border taxes. At the same time, it is necessary to consolidate and standardize carbon foot-print tracking methodologies applied to global supply chains in order to collect the data required for an effective and efficient  Carbon Border Adjustment implementation (i.e. carbon emissions along the full life cycle)",,,withinfo,company,large,closed,7587254,

Rusal meets 20 % of the EU growing PA demand 75 % of which is imported. Rusal’s PA and PA alloys are subject to the EU import duties of 3-6 %. 

Aluminium sector with 1.1 Gt CO₂ e accounts for 2 % of global anthropogenic emissions. Rusal measures carbon footprint of its operations and supports industry-wide decarbonisation. Sourcing more than 90 % of electricity supply from renewable hydro energy, Rusal is one of the leading low-carbon aluminium (LCA) producers. 

Rusal is a largest supplier of PA to EU processors of aluminium — a downstream sector dominated by SMEs — and is concerned that:
-	options for the EU unilateral and sector-specific Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) could undermine competitiveness of its customers in case the CBAM is not fully WTO-compliant;
-	CBAM could fail to support the already distressed PA production in the EU and not cope with efficiently reducing the so-called ‘carbon leakage’ caused by energy costs in the EU, i.e. by the EU ETS;
-	none of the discussed CBAM options appears to be in full compliance with the WTO rules, which may lead to severe and time-consuming trade disputes.
Even a WTO-compatible CBAM does not offer appropriate environmental and trade policy measures for at least those carbon-intensive sectors, which have long moved capacities outside the EU due to the lack of raw materials, high energy and labour costs. The PA sector is a case in point of that. 

Since 2000, the EU PA smelting capacity shrunk by ca. 30 %, while the EU consumption of PA grew by approximately the same percentage. Today, the EU meets ca. 75 % of its PA needs through imports, that is expected to continue. 

In this regard, there is little carbon leakage in the EU PA sector, as: 
1) no new smelters were commissioned in the EU for at least 30 years as a result of high costs, primarily in electricity and labour; 
2) reductions in the specific CO2 emissions of the existing EU smelters can only be achieved in external electricity supply, which accounts for 30-40 % of smelters’ costs. 

The inclusion of PA in the scope of CBAM will inevitably drive up the price of imported and domestic PA in the EU. For downstream companies who employ more than 90 % of the industry’s workforce the cost of PA can constitutes 40 to 80 % of the total. Any unilateral increase of those costs may trigger further “drain” of production from the EU. 
In order to deliver on the European Green Deal and to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2050, CBAM should employ tailored approach to such essential products as PA. 

The European Commission (EC) may wish to consider permanent unilateral import tariff suspension vis-à-vis products with low carbon content, such as LCA. Rusal has been proactive in industry-wide efforts to define LCA benchmark reflecting average performance and would be pleased to share the available knowledge.

The tariff exemptions for LCA are achievable through a separate CN code and a reliable system of CO2 footprint certification. Such approach could apply only to selected products that are currently subject to substantial WTO-bound import tariffs of >2 % in the EU. It would be fully compliant with the WTO rules, would support the EU in its climate agenda and level playing field for the EU downstream.

Additionally, CBAM could encourage industry-wide incentives for research collaboration for decarbonization and sustainability. This could cover inert anode and other breakthrough technologies for emissions/cost reductions, x-ray/sensor-based/laser detection technologies for recycling, among others.

Rusal welcomes the guidelines on CBAM and a fair, transparent, and inclusive process and would be pleased to share its expertise on the optimal ways of making the EU CBAM truly viable for the low-carbon future, and  ready for swift implementation.

IFIEC Europe’s response to the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

Improving carbon leakage protection of the European Union

Executive summary

In December 2019, the European Commission adopted the European Green Deal. In relation to policy measures to prevent carbon leakage the European Commission considered the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism.  IFIEC Europe welcomes the initiative of the European Commission to assess how the carbon leakage protection of the European Industry can be enhanced when the EU’s ambitions with regard to climate protection exceed these of other third countries.  This is a prerequisite if Europe would like to maintain its climate ambition and leadership in the world.  But IFIEC also recognizes that full carbon leakage protection with existing instruments becomes more and more difficult with increasing climate targets.  IFIEC Europe recommends to take the following aspects into account, when designing new or improving existing policy measures that aim at reducing the risk of carbon leakage: In the following sections these aspects are described in more detail.


1.	Effective carbon leakage safeguard policies needed, especially with increased climate ambition. 

It is crucial that the future carbon leakage protection policy mix remains at least as effective as the existing measures, both for importing and exporting sectors, so that the European industry can play an active role in the transformation of our economy into a low carbon society and to make the European Green Deal a success.  The EU ETS with sufficient level of direct and indirect compensation shall remain the key policy for this.  If additional carbon leakage protection policies are required due to increasing ambition, they must supplement rather than substitute the existing measures.


2.	Detailed impact assessment needed on all possible policy instruments.

In case of increased climate ambition, the European Commission should conduct a detailed impact assessment to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of a CBAM.  In parallel, impact assessments on other potential or existing carbon leakage protection policies need to be conducted and compared with the effectiveness of a CBAM. Key is to fully understand the impact the introduction of a CBAM or alternative measures would have on all the stakeholders affected.


3.	Complete industrial value chains need to be assessed in transparent way in cooperation with all stakeholders.

Industrial sectors and value chains are very complex interdependent entities, affecting and affected by the competitiveness of their other value chain actors.  The introduction of any new policy measure and their impacts must be carefully assessed, in order to avoid disrupting their functionality.  The European Commission should also analyse the characteristics and needs of different value chains and industrial ecosystems.  The analyses should be conducted in a transparent way and should closely involve all the stakeholders concerned.  IFIEC believes that a structured dialogue and cooperation between the European Commission and the industry sector must be established to investigate the regulatory framework needed.

Independently from the future impact of this crisis which cannot yet be anticipated, the impact assessment by the Commission of the proposed Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) mechanism should primarily try to understand if, when and how can CBAs strengthen existing carbon leakage measures. The impact assessment should also assess how the mechanism can preserve the competitiveness of EU products on export markets. The impact assessment should also address the fact that for sectors with similar characteristics as in the ceramic industry, CBAs do not appear to be neither feasible nor efficient in strengthening carbon leakage measures. Consequently, it will be even more important for these sectors to maintain the existing system of free allocations for best performers, potentially combined with other complementary policy instruments.
In particular: 
Carbon Border Adjustments should be designed to strengthen carbon leakage protection in the long term
Depending on the outcome of the ongoing decision making process on ETS benchmark updates and on the fluctuations of the carbon price (from 30€ to 50 €/tCO2), the European ceramic industry anticipates an ETS cost under Phase IV ranging from € 1 Billion to € 3 Billion, assuming that carbon leakage measures and the 2030 targets for the ETS sector remain unchanged.  In the absence of any carbon leakage measure, the cost for the sector would range from € 3.8 Billion to € 6.3 Billion.  Over the last years the European ceramic industry has done great investments to maintain its competitiveness in a globalised economy and reduce the carbon content of its products.  Any decrease of the carbon leakage protection foreseen until 2030 would significantly jeopardise the ability of the sector to further invest in new and breakthrough technologies or to develop key technologies further to bring them to the market (marketability). 

Policies merely increasing carbon costs on EU manufacturing without duly considering the carbon leakage risk will reduce EU carbon emissions from manufacturing as a result of relocation but will increase the EU’s consumed carbon due to imports from countries with lower or non-existing carbon costs on manufacturing.  That is why the main objective of CBAs should be to strengthen existing carbon leakage measures.

Key messages :

Hydro strongly support the importance of preserving the competitiveness of European industries, which is rightly recognized in the Inception impact assessment (IIA) for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). However, the IIA also states that CBAM should be an alternative to existing carbon leakage measures. 
•	For aluminium, we disagree that CBAM could be an adequate alternative carbon leakage measure. For our industry, it is of outmost importance that existing measures currently addressing the carbon leakage risk are maintained. 
•	Replacing free allowances and CO2 compensation with a CBAM would have severe effects on the entire European aluminium value chain and its customers. 
•	Our position is therefore that CBAM should not be introduced as an alternative carbon leakage measure for aluminium.
•	However, if a CBAM is considered to be introduced for aluminium, it should not replace current carbon leakage measure. 
Rather, it should be a tool to differentiate on carbon content of products, and it is essential that it would be correctly designed to avoid negative consequences for the aluminium value chain.

We welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and thus participate in the building of a successful measure to foster innovation in the cement industry. 

Indeed, this structural measure must be built on the right design to be a cornerstone of the European Green Deal. In our view, the carbon adjustment mechanism should:
-	Be designed to be compatible with the EU ETS 
-	Include provision to secure free allowances to new entrants, even importers, based on the similar benchmark used for the ETS, to support the most modern actors which made investments to reduce their carbon footprint
-	Be compliant with WTO rules and thus ensure a level playing field among importers and EU industries
-	Be a tool to promote innovative low-carbon investments.

But this mechanism should not be designed as a way to protect European polluting industries which already benefit from the wrongly calculated free allowances linked with the inefficiency of the EU ETS III. 

Industrial start-up, Cem’In’Eu developed a completely new concept for the production and sale of cement in Europe. Our approach to the market is based on the principle of « small is beautiful» with small, compact and standardised production units located as close as possible to regional economic areas.  We developed a completely new and fully optimised business model allowing for the reduction of the environmental impact of each activity along the entire value chain. Our activity is audited by the ""Carbone 4"" which calculated the carbon footprint of our company and of our products. In one year, we decrease our carbon footprint by 25% thanks to the optimisation of all levers (Clinker selection, logistics, cement recipes and packaging). Based on our experience, we are convinced that the new carbon border adjustment mechanism would be a powerful tool to thrive for greener products.

Regarding the type of policy instrument, Cem’In’Eu supports the extension of the EU ETS to imports. But we are convinced that a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports will not provide the right signal to the industry. This is a matter of efficiency, as such a design will not incentivize old European cement industries to invest in low carbon solutions. 

Cem’In’Eu supports the carbon border adjustment mechanism but calls the European Commission to define the right design in order to ensure that it will not be a protectionist barrier that will benefit to less innovative or more polluting factories.  

Regarding the methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content and carbon pricing of the imported products, Cem’In’Eu urges the Commission to adopt a comprehensive view that encompasses all aspects of the value chain and not just the final product. The methodological choices will be key to foster investments for the most efficient industries. To be efficient and fair, the tax must apply the same CO2 benchmark per ton of clincker as that in force for ETS 4. Moreover, new entrants, including importers should benefit from free ETS quotas, for a fair measure. 
Cem’In’Eu is convinced that the carbon border adjustment mechanism in the EU is the right tool to foster innovation in the cement industry. It could create a momentum for a behavioural change that was missing in the cement industry for years. ",,506912037725-23 ,withinfo,company,small,closed,7587254,

We therefore call for a proactive EU directive and for implementing measures to be taken in this regard as soon as possible.

This would be a giant step towards reconciling the defence of energy-intensive industries and the decarbonised economy. It must allow for fair competition at global level and not simply to outsource “pollution”. While respecting the rules of the World Trade Organisation, the aim of this mechanism would be to be a key industrial policy tool in pursuit of a number of complementary objectives: 

1. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;
2. Defending the highly strategic industrial sectors (such as the steel industry) of the European Union and thus defending the quality employment of workers employed directly or indirectly in these sectors;
3. the application of fair competition at global level.

The reduction of greenhouse gases in energy intensive industries is generally achieved through innovation of disruptions. However, these technologies and disruptive innovations are and will become (increasingly) expensive, which could have a negative impact on employment in Europe if they are not properly managed, accompanied and supported. Therefore, it is crucial that the EU’s carbon adjustment policy is not in place on its own. It must be accompanied by a coherent set of policy measures (financial, fiscal, social, etc.). Thus, a policy/legal/regulatory/competitive environment conducive to innovation should be a prerequisite for the introduction of the carbon adjustment principle at the borders of the European Union. Specific measures in the award of public procurement could also be envisaged. The creation of a market that will be able to welcome these innovations is therefore essential. Similarly, a mechanism should be developed to support export industries. It is imperative to ensure that the impact of these measures on all parts of the value chain is properly assessed... without forgetting the establishment and maintenance of a genuine social dialogue with trade union organisations (at all levels: At European level, Member States, regions and each company concerned). The whole of the system, by any inadequacy, cannot, under any circumstances, miss its target... and damage entire sectors, building on the European industrial fabric. Conversely, care must be taken that one or more measures do not promote deadweight effects. Finally, the implementation of this body will not be able to make a debate on various issues: The question of free allocation of allowances; The issue of interaction with the HTA system; The question of interaction with the Trade Defense Instruments, etc.

A ce titre, nous demandons qu'une directive européenne volontariste et que des mesures d'application soient prises à ce sujet dans les meilleurs délais.

Ce dispositif serait un pas de géant vers la conciliation de la défense des industries hautement consommatrices d'énergie et l'économie décarbonée. Il doit permettre d'établir une concurrence loyale au niveau mondial et non plus simplement d'externaliser ""la pollution"". Tout en respectant les règles de l'Organisation Mondiale du Commerce, ce dispositif aurait pour ambition d'être un outil de politique industrielle essentiel dans la poursuite de plusieurs objectifs complémentaires : 

1. La réduction des émissions de gaz à effets de serre;
2. La défense des secteurs industriels éminemment stratégiques (comme la Sidérurgie) de l'Union Européenne et donc ainsi la défense de l'emploi de qualité des travailleurs occupés directement ou indirectement dans ces secteurs;
3. l'application d'une concurrence loyale au niveau mondial.

La réduction des gaz à effets de serre dans les industries intensives en énergie se fait et se fera généralement au travers d'innovation de ruptures. Or, ces technologies et innovations de ruptures se font et se feront (de plus en plus) à un coût élevé, lesquels pourraient déboucher sur des conséquences négatives pour l'emploi en Europe si elles ne sont pas correctement managées, accompagnées et soutenues. C'est pourquoi, il est primordial  que la politique d'ajustement carbone aux frontières de l'Union européenne ne soit pas mise en place seule. Elle doit être accompagnée d'un ensemble cohérent de mesures politiques ( financières, fiscales, sociales,...). Ainsi, un cadre politique/légal/réglementaire/concurrentiel propice à l'innovation devrait être un prérequis à l'introduction du principe d'ajustement carbone aux frontières de l'Union européenne. Des mesures spécifiques dans l'octroi des marché publics pourraient aussi être envisagées. La création d'un marché qui sera en mesure d'accueillir ces innovations est de ce fait indispensable. De même, il faudra développer un mécanisme soutenant les industries exportatrices.  Il faudra impérativement veiller à estimer correctement  les impacts de ces mesures sur tous les maillons de la chaîne de valeur...sans oublier l'instauration et le maintien d'un véritable dialogue social avec les organisations syndicales de travailleurs (à tous les niveaux: au niveau européen, des Etats-membres, des régions et de chaque entreprise concernée). L' ensemble du dispositif, par une inadéquation quelconque, ne peut, en aucun cas, manquer sa cible... et mettre à mal des secteurs entiers, constitutifs du tissu industriel européen. Inversement, il faudra être attentif qu'une ou plusieurs mesures ne favorisent des effets d'aubaine. Enfin, l'implémentation de l'ensemble de ce dispositif ne pourra faire l'économie d'un débat concernant différentes questions: la question des quotas d'allocations gratuits; la question de l'interaction avec le système ETS; la question de l'interaction avec le Trade Defense Instruments,...etc...

Oxfam estimates of the scale of this inequality suggest that the poorest half of the global population – around 3.5 billion people – are responsible for only around 10% of total global emissions attributed to individual consumption. For years, developed countries have claimed they will not go beyond incremental targets to cut their emissions unless and until rapidly growing developing countries step up to cut their emissions too. While it is absolutely critical to any chance of averting the most dangerous impacts of climate change that all developing countries play their part too, it is worth remembering that the lifestyle consumption emissions of citizens of even the developing countries in the G20 are far lower than those of their counterparts in the rich OECD countries.
- On Part C
Overall, European Green Deal initiatives and legislation should undergo impact assessments and inter-service consultations to respect the ‘do no harm’ principle and policy coherence for sustainable development (PCSD). This is particularly important for the carbon border adjustment tax, which could impact domestic resources, exports and citizens in the Global South. 
- Likely social impacts
It is important to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalised by higher prices on essential products. Any environmental tax which is introduced must fit in a progressive tax mix. This means making sure that the polluter pays rather than further creating a burden on the poorest. When regressive effects of the tax are inevitable, compensation measures for the poorest should be introduced.  Ways of addressing this can include the provision of affordable alternatives and systems such as public transport as well as considering providing direct transfers to low-income households to mitigate the impact on their income.
- Likely environmental impacts
The effectiveness of the instrument and alternatives should be carefully considered. Will a carbon border tax really discourage carbon leakage or greenhouse gas emissions in countries exporting to the EU? Or are there other better and more effective policy instruments that could be introduced, e.g. import standards regulations.

- On Part D 
- Impact assessment
Impact assessment should consider policy options to mitigate impacts on LDCs and the poorest. It is important to note that LDCs might lose exporting opportunities as a result of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which has repercussions among others on LDCs’ balance of payments. As such, the revenues collected from the CBAM should be earmarked for fairness purposes.  These earmarked revenues could (1) compensate the costs of climate-related losses and damages already being experienced by communities in the Global South, (2) finance adaptation measures and (3) fund investments to enable a just transition. In particular the revenues accumulated in the EU  via the CBAM, when imposed on products imported from developing countries, could be directed to the UN’s Green Climate Fund or a fund to stimulate different types of LDCs’ exports to the EU. When a CBAM applies to countries that are neither least developed countries nor developing countries, such as non-EU OECD countries, the proceeds could be used for redistribution in the EU to mitigate impacts on low-income households, or again to the UN’s Green Climate Fund. 
- Evidence base and data collection 
It is important to consider additional sources of evidence related to impacts on developing countries and mitigating measures. 
- Consultation of citizens and stakeholders
We recommend consultation with CSOs on the impact that the measures can have on developing countries. We also suggest a longer period than 12 weeks for the public consultation to make consultation with CSOs meaningful.

The industry offers climate friendly products for European and global markets, also substituting more fossil intensive alternatives. Reaching i.a. climate objectives requires the safeguarding of EU industries' competitiveness and legislative predictability and stability.

Finnish Forest Industries Federation (FFIF) supports the goal of reducing carbon emissions globally and preventing carbon leakage. In our view, the EU should primarily improve and reinforce its existing carbon leakage system that addresses the issue at EU level.
 
Initially, we are concerned about a possible Carbon Border Adjustment Measure (CBAM) and its negative impacts. Our position is based on an analysis, the results of which highlight: 

•	the (technical) difficulty of realizing the measure; 
•	the negative effects it would have on international cooperation and trade; 
•	the negative effects it would have on EU business' competitivity (e.g. increased cost of imported inputs, having also an effect on export 
        competitivity); 
•	the expected inefficiency of the measure as to emission reductions; and 
•	the risk of removal of the current carbon leakage measures.   

Realizing CBAM WTO-consistently would be a challenge. CBAM is a new issue that is not directly governed by WTO agreements and it has not been addressed in dispute settlement. Even with most careful preparation the measure would likely be challenged by trading partners. In a worse case scenario, partners would simply, without a dispute process, deem the measure an illegal trade barrier. 

If a CBAM were realized, there could be discussion on the need and the possible removal of current carbon leakage measures. The question would arise whether CBAM and the current measures could co-exist and whether this would result in discriminatory treatment and be WTO-inconsistent. 
Having partners view EU measures or activity illegal or as protectionism would lead to retaliation or similar unilateral action on their part. Thus the measure and choices made could further deteriorate international cooperation, increase compliance cost and reduce competitivity, and increase the risk of trade wars. 

For now it is not known whether a CBAM will be proposed and if so, what type of measure it would be. With the information available currently, we understand that the possible measure would first apply to a limited number of sectors and that its scope could later be broadened. At the very least, forest industry should not be among the first sectors to which the measure would apply. Even so, there is no assurance whatsoever that our exports would not be hit hard by our partners reactions. 

We find it indispensable that each sector is carefully consulted and their views taken into account both if a measure is being prepared and more urgently if a sector is considered for inclusion in the scope of the measure's application. 

European forest industry exports more than it imports. The opportunities to export and spread European solutions should not be impaired.

The EU wants to become the first continent carbon neutral in 2050 which involves a deep turnaround of all the sectors of the EU economy. New climate constraints will nevertheless mean a more severe greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) reduction path with an increased risk of carbon leakage as underlined by the Commission. In this respect, Solvay welcomes the explicit recognition of the need to safeguard the international competitiveness of EU industries in light of asymmetric increasing climate ambitions in EU compared to the rest of the world. However, considering the recent Communication of the EU Green Deal, we believe that an impact assessment is needed on the different options envisaged to create a carbon border adjustment mechanism that would fulfil this objective.
2. A carbon border adjustment mechanism must come in addition to the ETS carbon leakage measures not as an alternative
The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) has been reinvigorated for the next period 2021-2030 with tighter mechanisms leading to fewer emissions and a stronger market price although with a reduced support to international competitiveness through shrinking free allocations. Considering those shrinking allocations, driven notably by lowered benchmarks, we will no longer be able to rely only on them to face the rising asymmetric situation for emissions costs between domestic production and manufacturing outside EU.
As the objective is to safeguard EU competitiveness, a carbon border adjustment mechanism should come as an additional complement to the ETS carbon leakage measures for chemicals and their value chains. Unfortunately and somewhat confusingly, the Green Deal is only considering such a carbon border mechanism as an „alternative“ to the ETS carbon leakage measures (see European Green Deal 11.12.2019 COM(2019) 640 final- page 5 para 4) which would then weaken the industry competitiveness. Chemicals are intricated in complex value chains with multiple stages each exposed to international competition and for which weighting carbon content is beyond feasibility. Removing the existing ETS carbon leakage measures would increase the chemicals costs as well as the value chain costs at stages for which a carbon border adjustment mechanism is also not feasible. This mechanism, if introduced as an “alternative” to ETS, would thereby fail to safeguard the international competitiveness of chemicals and its whole EU value chain.
3. Imported emissions should be captured in Europe’s efforts to mitigate GHG: under ETS, we are facing a decreasing cap of emissions coupled with a price to pay if emitting GHGs beyond a certain theoretical benchmark level, the aim being to drive down our emissions. Imports are nevertheless not submitted to ETS and therefore are gaining an increasing competitive advantage particularly when facing lower or even non-existent domestic price for their emissions. Therefore a carbon border adjustment mechanism, if introduced as a complement to the ETS carbon leakage measures, would then become a welcome tool to safeguard competitiveness for the part above benchmark that the current ETS carbon leakage measures are not providing. Such a mechanism, as described just here above, would also help motivating third countries to implement similar ambitious climate policy as in the EU. Policy makers must indeed ensure to level the playing field with other economies that do not comply nor pay for their emissions the way the EU does. 
4. EU exports competitiveness must be ensured:As for the whole European chemical industry, Solvay relies also on its exports to keep production production in the EU. In this regard, keeping the ETS free allocations based on genuine benchmarks are vital in particular to safeguard the production of soda ash in Europe. Any new additional carbon border mechanism or ETS measures should therefore safeguard or even improve our ability to compete.",,58089691185-94,withinfo,company,large,closed,7587254,

Any mechanism should be designed such that it:
o	improves the effectiveness of policies aimed at fighting climate change in the EU and globally 
o	does not deteriorate the global competitiveness of the EU industrial sectors

Feedback on the inception impact assessment:
Regarding the main issue which this initiative aims to tackle (the risk of carbon leakage), FuelsEurope encourages the Commission to not limit the scope of its study to “transfer of production outside the EU” but also to anticipate any “transfer of investment outside the EU”. 
FuelsEurope understands that the study currently underway to identify the risk of carbon leakage in the third and fourth trading phases of the EU ETS will involve the ETS sectors as part of a dedicated assessment (ETS directive related). In that respect, it is of utmost importance that both ETS and CBAM assessments are conducted in parallel with a high level of involvement of the sectors at stake.

How does a CBAM relate to the current measures to avoid the risk of carbon leakage?
As referred to in the Communication “A New Industrial Strategy for Europe” this CBAM should be supported by strengthening the current tools to tackle carbon leakage.
FuelsEurope considers that any CBAM cannot be a comprehensive alternative to measures that currently address the risk of carbon leakage in the EU if it only applies to imports.  

Impact assessment
Since the impacts of a CBAM will vary much depending on the design and in particular of the sectors covered, it is of utmost importance that the EU refining sector (one of the most exposed sectors according to the decision concerning the determination of sectors and sub sectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage for the period 2021 to 2030) is thoroughly impact assessed as part of the studies undertaken by the Commission.

Elements to be assessed
The impact assessment should consider the current and future internal EU carbon price resulting from both direct and indirect emissions.  The indirect costs are incorporated in the price of electricity passed to exposed energy-intensive sectors and their impact is expected to increase in the future with the further electrification of industrial processes.
In designing a CBAM the potential deterioration of the competitiveness of both products exported outside the EU and products along the upstream and downstream value and supply chains will also have to be carefully considered. 
As a result of this comprehensive impact assessment, it is expected that the Commission comes up with proposals on how those other carbon leakage related impacts shall be addressed.

Further consultation steps:
FuelsEurope will participate in the upcoming public consultation and give its views on all the aspects of a CBAM and together with Concawe remains ready for a more technical consultation with a view to provide any useful inputs and robust data that are needed to conduct the upcoming impact assessments.

This is not being done in a satisfactory way today and in many EU countries, including Sweden, emissions per capita are higher than perceived if consumption-based emissions are accounted for. Further, SSNC fully supports that economic policy instruments in the EU should favour ambitious climate action and increase costs for environmentally damaging activities regardless of where they occur. 

A Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) has the ability to address both of these issues. If designed correctly, it could address the consumption-based emissions embedded in consumption goods being imported to the EU, while at the same time allowing for an appropriate and higher carbon pricing within the EU. Therefore, SSNC is positive towards the European Commission exploring if and how a CBA can be implemented. SSNC holds that a policy tool like CBA likely will be necessary to deliver on the EUs long-term climate goals.   

SSNC would like to give the following recommendations to the European Commission regarding the development of a CBA:

-	Supporting a CBA does not imply that SSNC agrees with the notion that the EU industry suffers from carbon leakage, as this is still largely unproven. In this regard, a CBA will need to be complemented by a total phaseout of all free allowances that are currently being distributed to high emitting industries under the EU ETS, taking effect immediately. This must not be compromised. Giving out free allowances goes against the Polluter Pays Principle, and a CBA is therefore a better policy instrument to prevent possible carbon leakage, while allowing for a higher carbon price. 
-	Ideally, the sectoral or product scope of the CBA should be as wide as possible to strengthen the environmental justification of the measure and for the tool to be able to address consumption-based emissions. SSNC recognizes, however, that applying a wide scope initially might increase administrative burden. For the sake of not delaying implementation, SSNC therefore supports that the Commission assess pros and cons of different sectoral or product scopes and, if necessary, make a proposal for a gradual inclusion of sectors starting with 1) carbon-intensive basic goods (e.g., cement, steel) and deforestation risk commodities; 2) industrially processed goods; and 3) others. 
-	To assist the implementation of a CBA, all industries and medium-large companies should start accounting for emissions from the whole value chain, including Scope 3, and the Commission should offer support in this regard.
-	The sole objective of the CBA must be fighting climate change, and the CBA must not be used as a protectionist measure for EU industry. In this regard, the CBA should apply to imports only, and not also benefit exports. 
-	To avoid that the CBA result in negative equity impacts, it should be possible to grant exemptions for products (excluding hydrocarbons) from Least Developed Countries and countries responsible for a de minimis level of global greenhouse gas emissions.
-	Revenues from the CBA should be earmarked to further climate action in the EU or to assist affected lower-income countries to cut back on the carbon intensity of their economies.  

No measure known as a CBA has ever been implemented fully anywhere in the world. Putting in place a CBA is therefore likely going to be a big challenge, from a methodological and possibly legal point of view but also in terms of convincing trade partners of the usefulness and justification of the measure. In this regard, SSNC would like to stress that any reform or adoption of other policy measures, including adopting a new and revised 2030 climate target, must by no means be delayed while a CBA is being developed and negotiated.

HYBRIT is a joint venture project between SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall to create a fossil-free energy-mining-steel value-chain. HYBRIT recognises and welcomes the European Commission’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 – the project is a leading example of a breakthrough technology to produce fossil-free steel. 

We welcome the political willingness to create a level-playing field to prevent carbon leakage in order to meet the EU commitment to the Paris Agreement. We therefore support the Impact Assessment launched by the European Commission to assess various policy options around a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). However, any option proposed by the Commission should be carefully considered in light of the best available evidence provided by industries and stakeholders. It should follow closely the Council Conclusions “Ensuring competitiveness and sustainable, inclusive growth” which enshrines the Innovation Principle within the EU institutional framework by way of the impact assessment.

It is important to ensure that the currently revised Energy Taxation Directive takes into consideration the objectives of a CBAM and supports the production of fossil-free steel in Europe as well. Furthermore, discussions around CBAM must not delay the review and strengthening of the EU ETS, to bring it in line with the increased EU climate targets.

However, any move to a CBAM on the basis of the EU ETS product benchmarking should reward innovation and more efficient product substitution - this is not currently the case, where break-through technologies do not qualify for free allocation, for example.

There are a number of policy options the EU can turn to, none of which are specifically outlined in the Inception Impact Assessment, but all of which are viable from the Commission’s point of view. The impact of each option on HYBRIT would depend not only on the particular policy instrument, but also how it is implemented.

A CBAM aimed solely at imports into the EU would impose an adjustment mechanism on imported steel, whilst leaving EU production within the auspices of the EU ETS. In addition, European steel users would lose competitiveness internationally unless CBAM is taken into account and revised when exporting goods out of the EU. 

Whatever the final model for a CBAM is, it must together with the EU ETS and other climate instruments used, promote the most climate efficient value chain of steelmaking. The climate instruments therefor need to be synchronized so that the different parts of the value chain for fossil-free steel are supported to ensure production of fossil-free steel in a manner which ensures competitive costs for EU users of steel.

In such perspective, the introduction of a mechanism for avoiding the carbon leakage towards countries that don’t adopt a pay-as-polluting sistem,  appears to be a good measure but also very delicate to apply. 
First of all, the mechanism must be compatible with the WTO rules on free global trades, and it should be used mainly to leverage increased climate ambition from the EU’s trading partners, for instance through the implementation of meaningful emissions reduction mechanisms.
‐However, it should be also necessary to consider the impact of these solutions on value chains such as the wind industry, which relies on extra-EU imports of raw materials and components to deliver cost-competitive projects to their customers (as is the ERG Group ). 
‐	For all the considerations mentioned above, among the three possible alternatives proposed in the Impact Assessment sheet, the option of extending the EU-ETS ti imports seems to be the most viable one mainly because it shold avoids:

‐	the need of ending any free allowance of ETS quota to EU industry, necessary in case of application of a carbon import duty for avoiding any implicit advantage for european competitors;

In this context of crisis, Europe’s industrial strategy should be completely redefined. Climate, energy and industry policies should converge in a coherent way, ensuring security of supply for European citizens and a solid and pragmatic path towards carbon neutrality.

UNIDEN welcomes the recognition by the European Union of the need to safeguard the competitiveness of industry in Europe in a context of increasing the Union’s climate ambition. 

The objective of carbon neutrality proposed by the new European Commission will lead to profound changes in our behaviour to decarbonise our consumption patterns. This will therefore lead all European industry sectors to accompany this transition by investing heavily in decarbonising their production and at the same time offering low-carbon solutions to their customers.

In order to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the European Union and not just relocate our production to countries less concerned with their impact on the climate, it will be necessary to be able to finance these investments while maintaining the competitiveness of our means of production. This will be all the more difficult given that, with the Coronavirus pandemic, industry is heavily affected and their investment capacity is severely reduced or even non-existent.

UNIDEN welcomes the explicit recognition of the need to put in place measures to preserve the competitiveness of European industry in order to combat climate change more effectively without transferring emissions from our consumption patterns to other countries. 

In order to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, i.e. an increase in imports of products with a high carbon footprint to the detriment of low-carbon European production, UNIDEN considers that the introduction of a carbon inclusion mechanism at the borders of the European Union could — subject to appropriate arrangements and following an impact assessment — be able to preserve the competitiveness of European industry vis-à-vis industry located in regions or countries where the carbon constraint is much lower or even non-existent. 

However, such a mechanism will have to meet a number of conditions, and in particular must not jeopardise existing carbon leakage prevention schemes, in particular for energy-intensive companies; it will also have to be linked with appropriate measures to preserve the competitiveness of the downstream sectors.

Pour pouvoir réellement réduire l’empreinte carbone de l’Union Européenne et ne pas seulement délocaliser nos productions vers des Etats moins soucieux de leurs impacts sur le climat, il sera nécessaire de pouvoir financer ces investissements tout en préservant la compétitivité de nos moyens de production.

Achievement of ambitious climate targets requires to avoid any carbon leakage due to different national or regional climate regulations. In order to preserve international competitiveness, international cooperation and existing trading-regimes, any new established mechanism, e. g. a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, should be carefully considered. Necessary discussions to define such a system should be based on a holistic and carefully performed impact assessment. A complete package must focus on these main criteria: 

•	The VDA supports a multilateral, rule-based framework for international trade and investment. All potential measures being adapted  to avoid carbon and investment leakage have to ensure compliance with WTO rules and EU's international trade agreements.

•	Potential effects on the international trading system must be considered. This includes, for example, negative counter-reactions by affected states, regardless of whether the EU has de jure found a WTO-compliant measure. Any form of discrimination or unilateral preference must be prevented.

•	Furthermore, it has to be considered that according to the concept of the European Commission exports from the EU would not be unburdened from higher costs due to EU-climate policies. This has a negative impact on competitiveness of European industries.

•	A convincing concept of how a new mechanism - for instance a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - could be implemented in practice is not finally developed yet. Even the recording and verification of the CO2 content of a product (""Product Carbon Footprints"") is yet difficult to calculate for many products.

•	To what extent a concept would be effectively replacing national compensation measures, such as free certificates under the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) or the electricity price compensation under the German EEG is open.

•	Finally, a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism should not be established without assessing alternatives, such as common international Emission Trading systems. Furthermore it should be coordinated internationally to avoid possible counter-reactions by trading partners. In this regard, communication with trading partners is a prerequisite to achieve international acceptance of potential actions taken by the EU.  

•	Last but not least all negative consequences of the COVID19 Pandemic have to be taken into account. 

We call on the EU Commission to carry out a comprehensive impact assessment in order to examine the effects in detail. The VDA is happy to participate constructively in this process. At this state of the discussions a final assessment is not yet possible.

I believe the levies derived by the carbon border adjustment measure should be held in trust by the EU, and redirected toward that country, once it gives an indication it would like to invest in infrastructure, research and development, technology transfer, etc., to lower the carbon intensity of the relevant sector, product or industry. For the time being, the EU could decide on the appropriate channeling, institutions and mechanisms of these funds, but hopefully this would kickstart a process for this to be adopted by an international body such as the WTO, whereby common accounting, payment etc. rules exist for all participating countries.

This leads to numerous complications with regards to how a CBAM could effectively be implemented. 

As we explain in the paper enclosed to our submission, one major challenge, among many others, is for example how to measure carbon intensity considering aluminium’s unique electro-intensive in the smelting process and the related indirect emissions. We see that replacing free allowances and CO2-compensation with a CBAM, as suggested in the Commission’s inception impact assessment, would have severe effects on the entire European aluminium value chain and its customers. 

At the same time, given the still many unknowns on the possible design and scope of such a measure, we have put together in this paper a set of key principles and elements that the European Commission should carefully take into consideration if it had to introduce an effective CBAM for the Aluminium value chain. They are summarised below: 

•	A CBAM must not undermine or replace existing carbon leakage measures such as ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation. These should remain in place, be prioritised and improved;

•	A CBAM would have to cover the entire value chain, upstream and downstream, from the primary product down to the final product containing the commodity. If not carefully thought through and prudently implemented, there are concrete risks of increasing costs across the entire supply chain and thus eventually undermining (rather than protecting) our industry’s competitiveness in a world market;

•	A CBAM must not replace, diminish or impair an effective trade policy, existing duties or affect trade defense measures like Antidumping and Anti-subsidy tariffs as well as Safeguards; 

•	Policymakers should first carefully assess the specificities of the aluminium value chain compared to the other envisaged sectors (eg. steel, cement). 

•	If the CBAM also covers the carbon content for indirect emissions in the imported product, then it must also reflect the additional indirect costs European producers face compared to other global producers, in order to ensure a global level playing field (due to marginal pricing in European power markets, indirect costs are not directly correlated to indirect emissions, as explained in this paper). Hence it is essential that indirect costs compensation is kept alongside the CBAM. The two can co-exist as long as they do not cover the same cost. 

•	Overall, designing a system taking into account the specificities of the Aluminium value chain and global trade flows of the commodity, will be an extremely complex task. It will be paramount to first clearly assess the impact of a CBAM at each stage of the aluminium value chain.

•	A legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products will be needed.

•	Any proposed mechanism should be WTO compliant, not undermine the existing framework, should avoid creating additional burden, and should foresee tools to effectively avoid its circumvention.

In light of the challenges and complexities above, it is our preliminary view that a CBAM for aluminium is not an adequate instrument to address carbon leakage in our sector.  

We invite the Commission to instead improve the existing framework and consider other tools to support our industry’s transformation and commitment to the EU’s Green Deal Objectives. This especially in view of the announced higher climate ambition for 2030 and our sector’s unique and advanced electro-intensive nature compared to our energy intensive industries in Europe (e.g. chemicals, steel, cement).

In its Roadmap, the EC explains that the CBAM should tackle the problem of loss of competitiveness of European businesses due to EU regulations aiming at integrating the costs of CO2 emissions. FEAD would like to express that it should also help address the price gap between products containing recycled materials and those based on virgin material. A CBAM would support regulatory measures aiming at incorporating recyclates into products, and, more generally, the waste recycling chain.

1. A CBAM mechanism should take into consideration the energy content of imported products and put them on an equal footing with manufactured goods produced by industries subject to ETS. It would consequently cover imported products based on glass, cement, ceramic, paper, steel, aluminium, insofar as the “carbon leakage” mechanism does not fully compensate the CO2 costs for all sectors covered by the ETS. 

2. The CBAM should also take into consideration the material content of imported products and aim at putting on the same competitiveness level products that incorporate recyclates and products that originate from virgin materials. 

3. A CO2 compensation mechanism at the boarders should go hand in hand with EU policies based on mandatory recycled contents, such as the Directive 2019/904 on Single Use Plastics. The Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) adopted on 11.03.2020 puts clearly in the agenda that mandatory recycled content should be extended to other products, such as packaging, construction products, automotive. However, such EU regulations aiming at making the economy more circular result in increased costs in the whole product life cycle. 

That is why a CBAM should have under its scope the products that are covered, within EU, by mandatory recycled contents. That would be an essential tool against eco-dumping, and a necessary complement to mandatory recycled contents policies.
 
In addition, a CBAM would facilitate closing the loop within the EU economy by sourcing more waste as material resources for industrial production.

Furthermore, a CBAM would allow EU industries to compete on an equal footing with competitors from third countries which do not regulate their industries’ carbon emissions, nor regulate the whole material products’ life cycle by requesting the incorporation of recyclates in manufactured goods. 

4. Regarding green manufacturing, as part of CEAP’s eco-labelling scheme, the Commission should envisage a carbon label on products that are manufactured or sold within the Union, reflecting their CO2 intensity and showing their performance.

5. Undoubtedly, the implementation of a CBAM would face numerous practical, economic and legal challenges and constraints, the latter with regards to International Trade Law and especially with ensuring the mechanism is WTO-compatible, thus the mechanism needs to be applied to third countries without prejudice to the non-discrimination principle. The key is to structure any accompanying measure as a straightforward extension of the domestic climate policy to imports. The CBAM should be deployed gradually, starting with pilot sectors.

6. In order to achieve a functioning and successful CBAM, FEAD believes that further cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments are needed, especially with regards to comparing the carbon footprint of products with recycled content and products with virgin materials. A cost-benefit analysis of the mechanism is also required, based on detailed implementation aspects and related costs. In-depth analyses should be conducted with regards to the practical feasibility of the mechanism, the legal aspects involved, the compatibility of the mechanism with the EU ETS scheme and with WTO rules.",,2157643512-49,withinfo,business_association,micro,closed,7587254,

More than 700 companies from fourteen different sectors are affiliated with our business association. Together they contribute 6.2% to the Gross National Product of the Netherlands and offer direct and indirect employment to over 385,000 people. 

On behalf of our members, we are committed to strengthening the competitiveness and sustainable growth of the Rotterdam Port and Industrial Complex through entrepreneurship and innovation. This is in regard of the energy-transition and in context of the GreenDeal as proposed by the European Commission done from an approach of reaching Industrial Symbiosis. This approach is concretized through a 3 steps development towards a sustainable industrial cluster Rotterdam – Moerdijk in 2050.  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/sites/default/files/three-staps-towards-a-sustainable-industry-cluster-rotterdam-moerdijk-2050.pdf?token=Zo7BSWOU

Instruments that would accommodate this process of transition towards a competitive and sustainable industry should support these developments. So we can deliver on a consolidation of industry in the most energy-efficient clusters and safeguard jobs and necessary production for the society. 

In this context we want to reflect on the proposed instrument of a Border Adjustment Mechanism (Mechanism). What is needed is a consistent and coherent mix of public instruments which accommodate the transition. 

In view of the current economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, Deltalinqs recommends to take caution with regards to the introduction of  additional taxes/levies that will initially affect consumers in their purchasing power and subsequently have a negative impact on the industry and trade as a whole.

To be truly effective we also ask that in the measures the effect of scope 2 and 3 emissions will be taken into account. That can mean that temporarily higher CO2 emissions in industry but which, on balance, turn out to be more favourable in scopes 2 and 3 are also conceivable. On these points, it is important that industry is encouraged to take the measures in scope 2 (more sustainable energy supply and energy savings) and scope 3 (residual heat, climate-neutral raw materials). So that within Europe there will be a strong basis for sustainble production and basis industries. 

This is even more relevant for the current  impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the economy. This makes it urgent to get a clearer assessment on impact. So that this instrument does not lead to an increase in costs for end consumers.

Also relevant is the effect on the level-playing field in using the Mechanism. The Mechanism should not be used as a protectionary measure at the expense of the end consumer’s purchasing power. 

As long as the origin of products cannot be traced properly, setting a Mechanism risks being a paper sham law in which European industry is insufficiently protected and where disproportionate emissions may still occur elsewhere in the world.

To sum up, we advise to be cautious with the introduction of additional taxes/levies in the short term. The Mechanism, if created, should be supportive in developing a robust and sustainble industry in Europe from the context of jobs and welfare. Finally the Mechanism should be proportionate and the Mechanism should be practically executable.

Cefic welcomes the Commission’s focus on ensuring industry competitiveness for a climate-friendly transition, namely to become climate-neutral by 2050 while ensuring that European companies can globally compete on a level-playing field. 
Cefic remains a strong supporter of free and fair trade. In light of increasing EU climate ambitions, Cefic welcomes the recognition of EU policy makers of the need to protect against carbon leakage and safeguard the competitiveness of domestic industries. The best way to level the playing field is to ensure that other countries raise their climate ambition. As long as that is not the case specific carbon leakage measures remain necessary. 
-Problems the initiative aims to tackle:
Under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) EU industries are facing a declining cap on emissions towards 2030, coupled with a price to pay if emitting beyond a certain benchmark level, the aim being to drive domestic industries towards a decreasing GHG emissions path. However, imports into the EU are not subject to ETS and therefore will increasingly gain competitive advantage, if producers in third countries benefit from lower or no domestic carbon costs. Under the current ETS system, the free allocation of emission rights at benchmark levels seeks to safeguard the competitiveness of industry and avoiding carbon leakage. However, the more asymmetric emission targets and policy measures become, the more critical it will be to effectively level the playing field for EU industry through strengthened carbon leakage provisions. In order make Europe an attractive investment location for chemicals, such measures need to be part of a comprehensive industry policy. 
-Basis for EU intervention:
The increased EU ambition of leading the global fight against climate change is now putting new emphasis on “Border Adjustment Measures” (BAMs) or “Carbon Border Tax” as possible instruments to avoid carbon leakage; however, at this stage there is no specific proposal on how such measures could be structured other than that these measures would apply to imports into the EU. Product scope and target countries remain undefined for the moment.  
 
B. Objectives and policy options 

Cefic advocates for a comprehensive industrial policy strategy that enables industry to competitively transform to a low carbon economy. This strategy must embed an in-depth reflection on carbon pricing policies in general and on all possible policy options that would help mitigate carbon leakage and incentivize emissions reduction globally. An EU trade strategy strengthening the international rules-based system and fair competition should be part and parcel of that as well. 
The upcoming Commission impact assessment should therefore look at all carbon pricing policies and carbon leakage prevention options including direct and indirect carbon costs and consider several scenarios. The different options and resulting costs, including the impact of no action, should be carefully considered for their ability to set the right incentives towards competitive low carbon manufacturing in and outside of the EU. The impact assessment should include chemical products and cover the possible impact on chemical subsectors and downstream industries, taking into account that chemicals are widely used across many international value chains. 
In order to deliver the required benefits for the chemical industry, the following key principles should apply: 
1. Export competitiveness must be ensured 
2. WTO compatibility must be ensured 
3. Promote international dialogue to avoid trade conflicts 
4. Use revenues completely to support low carbon manufacturing and investment

Development of carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanisms requires, however, careful assessment. CBA-mechanisms are always second-best options in climate policy – even more so if they are unilateral. Multilateralism i.e. a broad global coalition of countries implementing ambitious climate policies together should remain as the best option and the overall goal for EU’s climate diplomacy. The EU has succeeded in leading and should continue to lead and push for progress in such a broad coalition through its own convincing policies. A broad coalition of ambitious countries would also create a demand pull for cutting-edge clean technologies developed in the EU and elsewhere.

The Commission should analyse whether CBA mechanisms are indeed necessary and the best policy avenue for the EU. If that would be the case, the Commission should in its communication propose, under which conditions CBA mechanisms should be introduced.

The problem definition for CBA mechanisms begins with the presumption “As long as many international partners do not share the same climate ambition as the EU, there is a risk of carbon leakage.” In this context, it is worth noting that in its proposal for European Climate Law in March 2020, the Commission deliberately excluded the option of reducing emissions or increasing removals outside EU’s borders. Such framing almost automatically implies a higher price of carbon and higher mitigation costs for the EU, as likely more cost-effective mitigation options outside the EU where “the same climate ambition is not shared” cannot be utilized. It therefore seems that the need for CBA mechanisms is partly dependent on whether the EU is open for emissions trading across its outer borders.

There is hardly any experience – even at technical level - about the use of CBA mechanisms. Implementation of such mechanisms in US or Canadian States is indeed worth exploring, but at the same time, it needs to be recognized that they are not comparable with the EU introducing such mechanisms for global trade.

We note that the planned roadmap is planning to carefully consider different types of policy instruments, methodological approaches for technical implementation and sectoral scopes. While all of this is useful, the Commission should also analyse and evaluate the political counterparty risks of CBA options, including risks like trade wars and backsliding in global implementation of the Paris Agreement and in the UNFCCC. These kinds of risks may be difficult to specify and quantify, but can be immensely important for decision-making in the EU institutions and should not be ignored.

If CBA mechanisms were introduced, that should take place gradually. The focus should first be in a few sectors, which are import-intensive (at EU and/or MS level) and where products are emission-intensive. The electricity generation sector with fossil fuels might be one of the candidates.

All thermal power plants participating in this stock exchange have an obligation to pay a CO2 emission fee, which significant increases their production costs. As the Pljevlja TPP is not included in the EU ETS system, it does not pay a CO2 fee and defines the same price as those producers are made up of CO2 emissions. It is clear that this EU producer is in an unprecedented position and the principles of equality and non-discrimination in the market are not respected. All countries in the same market must comply with the same environmental standards, state aid rules and pay the price for CO2 emissions.

For the time being, Montenegro is the only Western Balkans country to have adopted a regulation definition of CO2 payments, although in life benchmarks it will still not have application given that free CO2 emissions are defined for the county industries and pollutants. 
Therefore, the marginal CO2 tax must also be applied to the countries of the Energy Community, as they do not continuously pay for CO2, and they are not planning to so, until so, until the EU so to so.

Therefore, the margin tax must also be applied to the countries of the Energy Community, and it should be at a level that can be used as a positive for confiscation. In addition, cause of the EU’s increased efforts to achieve the climate, it will be more difficulty for countries planning to continue their legislation with the EU in the future unless they have already begun with adaptation. In addition, defining a tax tax for the energy sector will also have a significant impact on countries’ plans to review and build new Co-operative new powers plants, as well will contribute to reducing the cost-effectiveness of such projects, as well as their complete independence.",False,,"We are witnessing that the world is currently not on track to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, knowing that global warming has already reached 1 ° C. To meet the Paris targets, the European Commission has pledged to increase the EU's greenhouse gas reduction target for 2030 - from a 40% reduction in emissions to a 50 or 55% reduction from 1990 levels. The great step forward the EC has made towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 by adopting a European Green Agreement and a plan to adopt the first climate law will significantly contribute to the achievement of the goals in terms of achieving Europe's decarbonisation by 2050. However, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to take into account the countries of the Western Balkans that aspire to be EU members, as well as their goals that exist in terms of achieving the decarbonisation of national economies.

Since the focus of our organization is on the energy sector, comments will be directed to this sector.
We are of the opinion that the introduction of a CO2 border tax that the EC plans to adopt in the coming period is actually particularly significant for the Western Balkan countries, as they are not yet part of the ETS system and are therefore a significant advantage over EU countries because they have no levies, taxes or the fee they pay for the emission of CO2, which is integrated into the selling prices of final products sold in the EU markets. This is well illustrated by the following example:
Currently, the price of electricity in Montenegro is formed by comparing it to the prices of energy on the HUPX Stock Exchange in Hungary. All thermal power plants participating in this stock exchange have an obligation to pay a CO2 emission fee, which significantly increases their production costs. As the Pljevlja TPP is not included in the EU ETS system, it does not pay a CO2 fee and defines the same price as those producers who pay a CO2 emission fee. It is clear that this EU producer is in an unequal position and the principles of equality and non-discrimination in the market are not respected. All countries in the same market must comply with the same environmental standards, state aid rules and pay the same price for CO2 emissions.

For the time being, Montenegro is the only Western Balkan country to have adopted a regulation defining CO2 payments, although in real terms it will still not have proper application given that free CO2 emissions permits are defined for the country's largest industries and polluters. 
Therefore, the marginal CO2 tax must also be applied to the countries of the Energy Community, as they do not currently pay for CO2, and they are not planning to do so, until the EU ""forces"" them to do so.

Therefore, the marginal tax must also be applied to the countries of the Energy Community, and it should be at a level that serves as a real incentive for decarbonisation. In addition, because of the EU's increased efforts to achieve climate goals, it will be even more difficult for countries planning to join the EU to align their legislation with the EU acques in the future unless they have already begun with adaptation. In addition, defining a border tax for the energy sector will also have a significant impact on countries' plans to reconstruct and build new coal-fired power plants, since they will contribute to reducing the cost-effectiveness of such projects,  as well as to their complete unprofitability.

Achieving climate neutrality will require bold actions to build an ultra-efficient economy and accelerating direct electrification.
Within the green deal it is the right moment to reevaluate the carbon pricing instruments. We are drafting a common response document to the European Commission’s consultations on the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), also looking at the link with the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). We call the European Commission to develop an common approach for those three policy instruments.  
- Today electricity represents around 20% of final energy use and all 2050 carbon neutral scenario converge towards a multiplication by 2 to 3 to this share of electricity based on massive electrification of heat and transport based on low carbon power generation. This will require a significant transformation of the actual demand side with an active participation in energy efficiency, local low carbon generation and storage and the development of active flexible electricity demand. 

As far as Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is concerned:
- Risks of commercial retaliation (WTO compliance) shall be carefully evaluated as well as consequences on final prices to European businesses and consumers 
- Compliance with WTO shall be a prerequisite and the impact assessment shall make a deep evaluation of this.
- Competitive advantage of a powerful domestic low carbon market; will certainly bring add-value to the EU industry. Such parameter should be taken into account in the context of the work on CBAM. 
- A possible alternative would be to support low-carbon production of products in industry, by introducing incentives for reducing embedded carbon in production with emission benchmarks for low-carbon alternatives (e.g. recycling steel, etc.).

As far as Energy Taxation Directive is concerned 
- Today, in Europe, taxation and levies are far higher on electricity than on gas and this hamper electrification development specifically for heating. On top of this, the current ETD is looking at electricity tax irrespective of its source.
- Energy Taxation Directive and the per-unit energy tax widely implemented in the European Member States do not provide consumers with financial incentives for demand flexibility.
- A specific attention on electricity used for EV charging is needed in order to avoid burdening of EV operation cost and smart charging and use of EV in demand flexibility shall be encouraged possibly with lower taxation and levies 
- We call on the European Commission to consider minimizing the level of taxes applied to electricity in order to foster clean and renewable based electrification.

As far as Emission Trading Scheme is concerned 
- This price volatility shall be limited by a mechanism with at least a price floor and possibly a price cap organizing a type of corridor in a growing predictable evolution over the time 
- The extension of ETS to other sectors (in particular heating in building) shall be evaluated carefully.
 - Critically, a dedicated carbon pricing policy for buildings is crucially needed. Europe should start by addressing CO2 emissions of cities and buildings, which are the bedrock of global decarbonization.

Many energy-intensive industries are key industrial value chains for the European economy and their pathway towards net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is likely to be challenging.
To meet these ambitious goals, the EU will need to ensure that European economies and industries swiftly transition to a low-carbon economy in a cost-efficient way. 

A carbon border adjustment mechanism may be needed in order to minimise carbon leakage.
As long as no global price for carbon emissions is established and until countries align with the same climate ambitions, a carbon border adjustment mechanism may be necessary to minimise the risk of carbon leakage and incentivise decarbonisation outside of the EU. 
As we approach Phase IV of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) which is expected to increase the carbon price to all-time highs, the real test for European industries and economies is still to come. In preparation for the potential carbon leakage, the EU aims to create an internationally more level playing field for these industries through the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). 

As such, the CBAM will be directly complementary to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), so the EU must ensure that the EU has an emissions trading system with an appropriate carbon price and adequate rules. Therefore, the current review of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (MRR) is quintessential to the successful development of the CBAM. In line with this, an accurate carbon accounting system will be needed. Such an accounting system would need to take into account the benefits related to the use of energy efficient technologies, bioenergy, waste-to-energy, renewable fuels of non-biological origin and CCUS.

Specifically, the benefits of all types of CCU need to be recognised. It needs to be understood that many types of mineralisation (next to the recognised precipitated calcium carbonate) can permanently store carbon. Furthermore, the MRR needs to recognise that the capture and use of CO2 in fuels does not lead to additional emissions and that thus these fuels need to be regarded as low carbon or zero carbon when compliant with article 25 of REDII (2018/2001/EU). 

Finally, the potential of negative emission technologies needs to be revisited. Currently, plants that would capture CO2 from the air or from sustainably sourced biomass complying with art. 29 of REDII  and ensure the permanent storage of the captured carbon are not adequately remunerated. These technologies need to be remunerated for their contribution to the decrease of atmospheric carbon levels. Without remuneration, the technologies will struggle to mature and the rollout of these much needed negative emission technologies will be delayed or even completely barred from commercialisation.
A CBAM should, therefore, contribute towards a low-carbon and competitive European industrial sector, supporting the EU’s climate goals while acknowledging all measures that lead to real carbon abatements. 

Energy Technologies Europe (ETE) represents the suppliers of energy conversion technologies.
Members are located throughout Europe and are engineering cutting edge technologies contributing to a clean, secure, and affordable energy supply. ETE is particularly engaged with the future of the EU’s decarbonised industry with a focus on a multitude of technologies ranging from energy efficiency, bioenergy, waste to energy, renewable fuels and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).

challenge, one which should ideally be dealt with by introducing a global CO2
price. This should continue to be the overarching goal, but even without such
a price, we support the EU ambition to become climate neutral by 2050.

However, since the EU has introduced climate measures that are significantly
more ambitious than the rest of the world, we risk carbon leakage and
put jobs and production in Europe in jeopardy. Hence, progressively more
ambitious EU climate action requires efforts aimed at mitigating the
competitiveness effects for European industry at risk.

We realize the complexity of designing measures to this effect and we are
looking forward to being a constructive partner in the policy dialogue. In
principle, we support measures, including a well-designed carbon border
adjustment mechanism, to address the risk of carbon leakage. Any such
mechanism, however, must be designed with the overall objective to
contribute as much as possible to reducing CO2 emissions in a way that is
administratively manageable and causes as little trade friction as possible.

In particular this means:

Any mechanism will have to be WTO-compatible and should not
be protectionist in design or purpose. It must be transparent,
proportional and non-discriminatory. This will in turn reduce the risk
for trade retaliation.

If the mechanism gradually replaces the current system of free
allowances, the EU export competitiveness to third markets must be
addressed.

The mechanism should apply both to direct and indirect emissions
from electricity use, as the latter is an increasing part of the production
costs.

The revenue collected should be used to fight climate change. This
will strengthen the climate profile of the mechanism and further reduce
the risk of trade retaliation from third countries.

The mechanism should initially be limited in scope and could then
gradually be expanded to more sectors where the carbon content is
reasonably easy to estimate.

Increasing costs of raw materials and intermediate goods resulting
from the mechanism, must not lead to carbon leakage further along the

MTK is an interest organisation representing farmers, forest owners and rural entrepreneurs in Finland. MTK has over 316 000 members in local agricultural producers’ organisations and regional forest management associations. 

In principle the CBAM could be an excellent measure to avoid carbon leakage in all sectors. It is of the utmost relevance in emission-intensive sectors, in which the ETS system is already in place. 

Carbon is not the only thing what should be followed. Water use, biodiversity, deforestation and animal welfare, resource efficiency, use of fossil fuels etc. also need attention a compensating adjustment mechanism.

Our goal is to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Any weakening of the EU’s current border protection for agricultural or forestry products could dramatically undermine efforts to this goal. Due to the urgent nature of climate action, a chapter on the application of climate measures with the possibility to sanctions must be included in all free trade agreements.

The future does not lie in decreasing productivity and shifting production as well as climate impacts (carbon leakage and water scarcity) to third countries with lower standards. We have to make sure that the consumption complies with all the Sustainable Development Goals including trade policy.

Before having a new carbon pricing system, the EU should, if necessary, suspend tariff preferences when non-compliance with the provisions of the agreement on sustainable development upsets the balance of competitive conditions for European producers. Secondly there is a possibility in the antidumping legislation to have tariffs also because of environmental requirements.

Carbon pricing mechanisms in agriculture and forestry should be based on the carbon farming framework envisaged by the Commission and be compliant with the CAP. Within this scope, the carbon dioxide that farmers remove (negative emissions) would also be recognised in traded goods according to their production method. This carbon farming framework must neither contradict the Emission Trading Scheme nor the Effort Sharing Regulation. The special role of agriculture in climate action, as laid out in the Paris Agreement, must be recognised.

Carbon border adjustments on agricultural goods must be based on the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles, including carbon sequestration. If agricultural and forestry products fall within the scope of the CBAM, principles should be elaborated with farmers and forest owners.

While no WTO member has established a similar mechanism, there is a number of technical, legal and political questions.

- The CBAM must be compatible with the WTO and other international trade commitments.
- It must minimise administrative burdens where possible and not have any adverse effects on the environment or climate
- A carbon marketplace or crediting schemes should be part of the incentivising toolbox to deliver on climate objectives.
- The CBAM should be thoroughly assessed and carefully thought through along the entire food chain.  

The Commission to undertake a thorough impact assessment along the entire value chain prior to initiating any CBAM.
- The flat-rate calculation methods do not work.
- The tax on agricultural imports from unsustainable land use (i.e. deforested land) should be prohibitively high.
- A huge amount of information will be required in order to establish a fair and uniform calculation system.
- The trading partner countries should have properly implemented schemes for the CBAM.

From MTK’s point of view there are too many open questions to build up a successful CBAM system, which could be used EU-wide and does not lead to costly red tape at the EU borders. If we are willing to use the CBAM in EU level, good starting point to test the system could be sectors like steel, aluminium, cement or electricity.",,MTK 56039441735-48,withinfo,business_association,medium,closed,7587254,

It is essential that a carbon border adjustment is implemented as a complementary measure in addition to existing carbon leakage provisions in the transition towards climate neutrality. This measure should be applied, in the form of the customs on the imported products. We strongly oppose any other form of tax, fee or any other financial burden levied on the domestic EU production.  
•	A carbon border measure aims to reach the combined environment objectives of the EU policy: reducing emissions, avoiding carbon leakage and complying with the costs of the cap & trade system. A complementary border adjustment would not lead to double protection. In fact, even with free allocation and compensation, EU producers bear carbon costs that are not applied to extra EU competitors. 
•	EU producers are subject not only to compliance costs for the difference between their emissions and free allocation and between indirect costs and compensation, but also to the full abatement costs that are necessary to develop the breakthrough technologies required to fulfil the emission reduction targets. A border adjustment replacing the existing carbon leakage measures would undermine their financial ability to invest in those technologies.  
•	While it is important to develop the border adjustment as soon as possible, its implementation should not lead to abrupt modifications of existing provisions in order to secure legal certainty for long term investment decisions. In particular, rules on carbon leakage measures for the period until 2030 have been adopted very recently and should not be modified. 
•	A carbon border measure implemented as a complementary instrument would also reduce the direct impact on trade flows and would mitigate trade tensions as it would provide a longer transition for negotiations with international partners to align climate ambition. 
•	Similarly, a border measure complementary to free allocation and indirect costs compensation would decrease the product price impact on downstream sectors within the EU. 
•	As long as it is uncertain whether a border measure may address the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to EU exports in third countries, a border measure with full auctioning for EU producers would burden them with the full carbon costs, thereby undermining their ability to access export markets.  
•	If a carbon measure is implemented with full auctioning for some sectors, the legal framework will lead to significant distortions of competition against other sectors that are still largely shielded from the carbon costs through free allocation and indirect costs compensation.
•	The use of the EU ETS (benchmark) methodology in the carbon determination methodology, is the fastest solution. At the same time, we call on the Commission to prepare  the methodology for setting the amount of duty / charge and to link it to the EUA price. We do not support the development of a separate methodology for the determination of the carbon content of products as this would mean a considerable delay and prolongation of today's adverse situation
•	It is clearly possible to design a WTO compliant carbon border measure that complements free allocation and indirect costs compensation in a transition period.
While a border adjustment based on the equivalent direct and indirect ETS costs can be an effective measure in the initial transition phase, a long-term regulatory framework is required for the advanced transition phase and the post-transition, i.e. when the breakthrough technologies reach sufficient market penetration and CO2-lean steel represents a critical mass of the market, but operation costs are still significantly higher than for competitors with CO2-intensive production. Such framework should be based on the actual CO2 footprint of the product over the entire lifecycle, requiring the development of a proper accounting system, both at EU level and at the border

VIK position on the European Commission’s Impact Assessment for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

The VIK welcomes the European Commission’s initiative to examine how to improve the protection of European industry against carbon leakage. In the VIK’s view, the following aspects should be taken into account when designing new or improving existing policies aimed at reducing the risk of carbon leakage:

• The European Commission should conduct a detailed impact assessment to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of a CBAM compared to other potential or existing policy instruments in preventing carbon leakage and to understand the impact that the introduction of a CBAM would have on stakeholders and value chains.

• The analyses should be carried out in a transparent manner and with the close involvement of all stakeholders concerned. The VIK considers it necessary to establish a structured dialogue and cooperation between the European Commission and the industrial sector in order to examine the necessary regulatory and commercial framework. Given the complexity and interdependence of value chains and the wide divergence of economic and regulatory realities between EU Member States, this dialogue should also involve national industry associations and experts. As a cross-industry association, the VIK is happy to provide its expertise here.

• The rising CO2 @-@ costs in the EU @-@ ETS and the resulting growing CO2 @-@ pricing gap with third countries make it urgent for the foreseeable future to further develop Europe’s carbon @-@ Leakage @-@ protection. In order to ensure this, existing policy measures in the short term, such as free allocation and compensation for indirect CO2 costs, need to be improved. We consider it important to build on the positive experience gained in the past with the existing toolkit.

• In parallel, the Commission should fully consider complementing the existing instruments on carbon @-@ Leakage @-@ Protection and explore a CBAM and other alternative instruments and solutions (e.g. Carbon Contracts for Difference, CO2 @-@ levy on consumer goods to compensate for the additional costs and/or financing of CO2 @-@ neutral/low production processes of industry). However, new measures to protect carbon leakage must under no circumstances replace, but complement, the existing system of free allocation and compensation of indirect CO2 costs.

• A significant risk for the introduction of a CBAM is to obtain realistic data on its CO2 @-@ actions from third countries. Renewable electricity could be included in the balance sheet by third countries for export products to the EU in order to suggest low-carbon or neutrally produced products. 

• The EU should seek early dialogue with third countries when considering the introduction of a CBAM in order to build the necessary international consensus for such an instrument and to implement a robust monitoring, reporting and verification system.

VIK-Position zur Folgenabschätzung der Europäischen Kommission für einen Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

Der VIK begrüßt die Initiative der Europäischen Kommission, zu prüfen, wie der Schutz der europäischen Industrie vor Carbon Leakage verbessert werden kann. Aus Sicht des VIK sollen bei der Gestaltung neuer oder bei der Verbesserung bestehender politischer Maßnahmen, die darauf abzielen, das Risiko von Carbon Leakage zu verringern, folgende Aspekte berücksichtigt werden:

•	Die Europäische Kommission sollte ein detailliertes Impact Assessment durchführen, um die Wirksamkeit eines CBAM im Vergleich zu anderen potenziellen oder bestehenden Politikinstrumenten im Hinblick auf die Vermeidung von Carbon Leakage gründlich zu prüfen und um die Auswirkungen zu verstehen, die die Einführung eines CBAM für die betroffenen Akteure und Wertschöpfungsketten nach sich ziehen würde.

•	Die Analysen sollten auf transparente Weise und unter enger Einbindung aller betroffenen Interessengruppen durchgeführt werden. Der VIK ist der Ansicht, dass ein strukturierter Dialog und eine Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Europäischen Kommission und dem Industriesektor eingerichtet werden muss, um den notwendigen regulatorischen und kommerziellen Rahmen zu untersuchen. Da Wertschöpfungsketten komplex und interdependent sind und die wirtschaftlichen und regulatorischen Gegebenheiten zwischen den EU-Mitgliedstaaten stark divergieren, sollten an diesem Dialog auch nationale Industrieverbände und -experten beteiligt werden. Als branchenübergreifender Verband stellt der VIK seine Expertise hier gerne zur Verfügung.

•	Die steigenden CO2-Kosten im EU-EHS und das daraus resultierende wachsende Gefälle gegenüber Drittstaaten im Bereich der CO2-Bepreisung machen auf absehbare Zeit eine Weiterentwicklung des europäischen Carbon-Leakage-Schutzes dringend notwendig. Um diesen zu gewährleisten, müssen kurzfristig bestehende politische Maßnahmen, wie die kostenlose Zuteilung und die Kompensation der indirekten CO2-Kosten verbessert werden. Wir halten es für wichtig, auf den positiven Erfahrungen, die in der Vergangenheit mit dem bestehenden Instrumentarium gesammelt werden konnten, aufzubauen.
 
•	Die Kommission sollte parallel dazu eine Ergänzung der bestehenden Instrumente zum Carbon-Leakage-Schutz umfassend prüfen und ein CBAM sowie weitere alternative Instrumente und Lösungsansätze untersuchen (u.a. Carbon Contracts for Difference, CO2-Abgabe auf Konsumgüter zum Ausgleich der Mehrkosten und/oder Finanzierung von CO2-neutralen/-armen Produktionsprozessen der Industrie). Neue Maßnahmen zum Carbon-Leakage-Schutz dürfen das bestehende System aus freier Zuteilung und Kompensation der indirekten CO2-Kosten jedoch in keinem Fall ersetzen, sondern müssen dieses ergänzen.

•	Ein erhebliches Risiko bei der Einführung eines CBAM besteht darin, aus Drittstaaten realistische Daten über deren CO2-Maßnahmen zu erhalten. Erneuerbar erzeugter Strom könnte von Drittstaaten bilanziell Exportprodukten in die EU zugerechnet werden, um CO2-arm oder -neutral erzeugte Produkte zu suggerieren. 

•	Die EU sollte frühzeitig den Dialog mit Drittstaaten suchen, wenn sie die Einführung eines CBAM erwägt, um den nötigen internationalen Konsens für solch ein Instrument aufzubauen und um ein robustes Monitoring-, Reporting- und Verifizierungssystem zu implementieren.

CLC supports the climate neutrality target of 2050 for the EU. We also think that the EU ETS is an efficient tool to reduce carbon emissions in the energy and industrial sectors. 

Relating to border Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism CLC has following comments:

•	Ensuring a level-playing field is important. If there is evidence of unfair competition, the first action to level the playing field should be to find ways to help the EU’s trade partners to improve their policies, for example by implementing carbon pricing and promoting the trade of climate-friendly goods and services. 
•	Other possible actions could include using new and existing regional trade agreements (RTAs), holding talks with like-minded WTO Members, including climate-related issues in the WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) and border carbon adjustments (BCA) for those sectors that cannot be levelized otherwise. 
•	It should be evaluated how trade policies and agreements could be utilized in this, starting from those sectors that cannot be levelized otherwise.  

CLC would also like to high-light that in addition to level playing field of the European companies in the main market areas also negative climate impact of imported goods into the Union had to be tackled somehow. According to the Global Carbon project, the contribution of imports has been reported as significant since 1990 (Figure 1). In the future, when EU climate policies will tighten, the contribution of imports may grow. CLC proposes that this problem would be considered at the same time with Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The best way to tackle this is to push for a global coalition that works together on the implementation of the Paris agreement.

Additional market economy measures are necessary to enable decarbonisation of the industry, while avoiding carbon leakage. An assessment and a revision of current and new policy instruments are therefore needed to achieve the Green Deal’s objective of a decarbonized and competitive EU.

In order to incentivize industry decarbonisation, a sufficiently high carbon price will be required while avoiding carbon leakage and maintaining industrial production within the EU. Investments in low-carbon technologies should be rewarded by putting an adequate price on greenhouse gas emissions ($50-100/tCO2 by 2030 to achieve the Paris Agreement goals according to the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices). We therefore need a well-functioning EU ETS, while making sure that a high carbon price does not encourage a shift in emissions to other jurisdictions with no, or lower, carbon prices. 

Eurima believes that a carbon border adjustment mechanism may be one possible option to create a level playing field for low-carbon products. Before preparing any legislative proposal, the feasibility of such a mechanism needs to be robustly analyzed through an in-depth impact assessment. This assessment should encompass a careful analysis of the mechanism’s functioning in relation to the existing climate and energy policy instruments. The following four principles should be kept in mind in the design of such a mechanism:

Firstly, the overall objective of the mechanism, to help sustain and increase domestic climate ambition while also incentivizing other countries to take comparable action, needs to inform decisions on how a border measure is introduced. Retaliatory measures by third countries need to be avoided, for example by involving third countries in the process to determine whether these countries have taken comparable action. The first global stock-taking foreseen during COP26 could represent a first occasion to assess global climate policy developments.

Secondly, we also encourage the Commission to analyse other types of instruments and policy options to help decarbonize industry and sustain production, demand and uptake of low-carbon products in the medium- and long-term. This can include targeted incentives for energy efficiency investments or instruments such as public procurement.

Thirdly, administrative complexity should be avoided as much as possible. In the reflection on the methodological approach to evaluating the carbon content of products, we recommend the European Commission to base its analysis on well-consolidated market practices, following EU and International Standards. For construction products, such an assessment needs to be based on Environmental Products Declarations (EN 15804 standard and its V2), which represents a worldwide reference with more than 7,300 construction products covered.

Fourthly, the carbon border adjustment should avoid competitive distortions, within and outside the EU. A fair and solid assessment of this matter is needed.

Today, buildings account for 40% of energy consumed and for about 40% of CO2 emissions. The annual renovation rate of the building stock varies from 0.4% to 1.2% in the Member States. This rate will need at least to double to reach the EU’s energy efficiency and climate objectives. 

The EFBWW believes that the current system of emission allowances for energy-intensive industries should be evaluated.  A specific action plan should be developed to push energy intensive industries towards innovation and ambitious reduction of carbon footprint with the intention to safeguard a future for these industries in the EU. We need intensified and EU-wide coordinated technical innovation processes for the various technical processes (like cement production).

To successfully decarbonize the construction and building material industries and secure support of workers and society at large, implies that solidarity mechanisms are in place to ensure that all workers can benefit and that nobody is directly or indirectly victimized by the European ambitions. We believe that all the relevant stakeholders should be actively involved in the consultation process.  On the other hand, we also need to recognize that the European Green Deal will seriously impact energy-intensive industries like cement production. 

EFBWW supports the idea of having a European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to reduce emissions by 2030 and 2050, however its design and implementation requires a deeper discussion among EFBWW members. 

Implementation 

To avoid the perverse situation that raw materials, semi-finished products (such as clinker in the cement industry) and/or building materials are produced outside the EU and imported to the EU to evade the higher EU environmental and social standards, we need a more performant instrument to fight carbon leakage. The introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism will be crucial to protect the goals and ambitions of the European Green Deal and at the same time safeguard competitiveness of the construction industry and allied industries, while simultaneously protecting jobs. It will also remove the incentive for companies to relocate their business and avoid the carbon fee. 

While many aspects of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will require further technical and political discussions, EFBWW has already identified the following elements as guiding principles for the upcoming negotiations:  the core objective of any proposal should be that an importer to the EU market faces the same CO2 costs as an EU domestic producer. 

A European Carbon Adjustment Mechanism should be based on the following principles:

•	fairness for both EU and non-EU producers
•	traceability and transparency of the imported/exported products
•	prevention of carbon leakage and imported CO2 emissions
•	compatibility with WTO rules
•	a positive impact on climate

The EFBWW welcomes the debate on carbon border mechanisms as a unique opportunity to create a level playing field between the EU and its partners with regard to the cost of carbon. If designed properly, a carbon border mechanism could be one of the instruments towards the just transition and could also create the level playing field the industry needs to deliver low-carbon investments and move towards carbon neutrality down the value chain. It could also incentivize third countries to step up their efforts on climate change.

The EU ETS has been successful for certain sectors, but has failed to incentivise large scale decarbonisation of European industry, in part because of its excessive measures to guard against the hypothetical risk of carbon leakage. Industrial companies have gained billions of euros in windfall profits from the EU ETS, due to the free allocation of allowances, despite the fact that there has never been - and it is unlikely there will ever be - any significant risk of carbon leakage from the EU ETS.
Given this, neither the free allocation of allowances nor a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) are necessary tools for climate action. However, a CBAM is preferable to free allocation as a CBAM ensures that polluters pay for their emissions. The European Commission should also consider alternative policy options in its impact assessment including the implementation of carbon emission performance standards for energy-intensive materials and creating markets for zero-carbon solutions through public procurement. If a CBAM is to be introduced, we consider the following prerequisites and design elements necessary.
First, all forms of free allocation and cost compensation schemes should be fully and immediately phased out under the ETS. Under no circumstances should free allocation and CBAM co-exist, as this would result in double protection against a risk which is unlikely to materialise in the first place.
Second, the CBAM should be designed in a way that incentivises other countries to take more ambitious climate action, rather than as a punishment mechanism for climate laggards. This requires that pathways be identified to inform other countries how their industries can be exempted from CBAM obligations, e.g. if they adopt carbon pricing measures in line with the Paris Agreement’s objective of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C°.
Third, in respect of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States should be exempted from CBAM obligations. In addition, all revenues should be allocated to climate action, with a majority disbursed in the form of climate grants to developing countries.
Fourth, a CBAM should be implemented through a benchmark system. However, the benchmark values should not be the same as those used under the ETS. While ETS benchmarks are set at the level of the 10% best performers in order to incentivise companies to reach that threshold, using the same values would have the exact opposite impact in the context of a CBAM. This would be equivalent to assuming that imports have been produced with the same level of emissions as the 10% best performers in the EU. No value lower than the average carbon intensity of a product manufactured in Europe should be used. Companies wishing to sell goods on the European market should also be allowed to provide evidence that their product is less carbon intensive than the benchmark, and benefit from a lower CBAM obligation accordingly.
Fifth, while the most straightforward way of implementing a CBAM would be through a tariff measure, this is likely to be the most politically difficult implementation strategy, both inside and outside the EU. A more realistic avenue would be to rely on the existing infrastructure of the EU ETS and require importers to purchase EUAs to cover their CBAM obligations. These EUAS would be taken directly from the amount already set for the future, without any changes to the cap.
We recommend that only cement, steel, chemicals and power be covered by the CBAM mechanism, as these are the highest sources of emissions under the ETS, and emissions embedded in imports from these sectors are estimated to be around 8% of annual emissions covered by the EU ETS. Given the massive oversupply of allowances on the market, there is no need to adjust the cap to account for this.",,,withinfo,environmental_organisation,small,closed,7587254,

Depending on the policy instrument, a CBAM could generate additional and cumbersome processes at the border, potentially leading to impact on operators (such as EEA members) supporting global supply chains of companies and taking care of customs’ processes and declarations. This would trigger more complexity and less transparency for EU customers and importers. To ensure a more simple and transparent process, calculation and/or collection of the CBAM should occur at the time of sales, not at the border. We would like to suggest including avoidance of the potential impact on border processes and operators in the impact analysis.
2.	Under “likely impact on simplification and/or administrative burden” and “likely economic impacts”, the potential impact on SMEs should also be analyzed in the impact assessment.

Position paper


• The decarbonisation of industry in Europe must not be achieved by replacing domestic production with imports with significantly higher CO2 @-@ loads. Protection against carbon leakage must therefore be a key component of industrial and climate policy. 

• The EU steel industry is particularly vulnerable to carbon leakage due to strong international competition. From a prospective point of view, this risk is greatly increased by increasing costs from the ETS. In particular in the fourth trading period of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the steel industry faces significant under-allocations of allowances. 

• In order to avoid carbon leakage, priority is given to existing preventive measures such as free allocation of allowances. Border adjustment should at most complement these, but should not replace them. Border adjustment should therefore only be considered if conventional carbon leakage is no longer sufficient to avoid serious disadvantages in international competition resulting from the ETS. 

• A border adjustment must be WTO @-@ compliant. This means, in particular, that at the border there is only compensation for the costs that European providers also have to bear through the ETS, thus avoiding discrimination. CO2 costs incurred by foreign suppliers in their home country must also be taken into account. This also creates incentives to avoid CO2 in third countries.

• Border equalisation is not an instrument that would directly promote a transformation towards CO2 @-@ poor steelmaking. Rather, during the transition phase, it serves to avoid a premature shutdown of conventional CO2-intensive processes in the EU. However, revenues from border adjustment can be used to support the transformation and thus facilitate the transition to low-carbon steel production.

• The steel industry in Germany welcomes the fact that the European Commission is currently examining the possibility of introducing a border adjustment. However, if border adjustment is introduced, it must also be designed in such a way as to effectively avoid carbon leakage. Under no circumstances should this instrument entail the prospect of abolishing the free allocation of allowances or of waiving full electricity price compensation.",False,Rolf,"Border Adjustment – Ein möglicher Baustein zur Verhinderung von Carbon Leakage

Positionspapier


•	Die Dekarbonisierung der Industrie darf in Europa nicht dadurch erreicht werden, dass inländische Produktion durch Importe ersetzt werden, die mit einer deutlich höheren CO2-Belastung verbunden sind. Der Schutz vor Carbon Leakage muss daher ein zentraler Baustein der Industrie- und Klimapolitik sein. 

•	Die Stahlindustrie in der EU ist aufgrund des scharfen internationalen Wettbewerbs besonders Carbon Leakage gefährdet. Perspektivisch nimmt diese Gefahr durch steigende Kosten aus dem ETS massiv zu. Vor allem in der vierten Handelsperiode des Europäischen Emissionsrechtehandels drohen der Stahlindustrie erhebliche Minderzuteilungen an Zertifikaten. 

•	Priorität zur Vermeidung von Carbon Leakage haben bestehende Präventionsmaßnahmen wie die kostenfreie Zuteilung von Zertifikaten. Ein Grenzausgleich sollte diese allenfalls ergänzen, darf sie jedoch nicht ersetzen. Border Adjustment sollte also nur dann in Erwägung gezogen werden, wenn herkömmlicher Carbon-Leakage Schutz nicht mehr ausreicht, um schwere Nachteile im internationalen Wettbewerb, resultierend aus dem ETS, zu vermeiden. 

•	Ein Border Adjustment muss WTO-konform ausgestaltet sein. Dies beinhaltet insbesondere, dass an der Grenze nur ein Ausgleich für die Kosten stattfindet, die auch europäische Anbieter durch den ETS zu tragen haben, eine Diskriminierung mithin vermieden wird. Auch müssen CO2-Kosten, die ausländischen Anbietern in ihrem Heimatland entstehen, berücksichtigt werden. Dadurch entstehen auch in Drittländern entsprechende Anreize zur CO2-Vermeidung.

•	Ein Grenzausgleich ist kein Instrument, mit dem eine Transformation in Richtung CO2-arme Stahlerzeugung direkt gefördert würde. Es dient vielmehr in der Phase des Übergangs dazu, dass herkömmliche CO2-intensive Verfahren in der EU nicht vorschnell abgeschaltet werden. Einnahmen aus dem Grenzausgleich können jedoch zur Stützung der Transformation verwendet werden und damit den Übergang in eine CO2-arme Stahlerzeugung erleichtern.

•	Die Stahlindustrie in Deutschland begrüßt, dass die Möglichkeiten zur Einführung eines Border Adjustments gegenwärtig von der Europäischen Kommission geprüft werden. Sofern ein Grenzausgleich eingeführt wird, muss dieser jedoch auch so ausgestaltet sein, dass Carbon Leakage wirksam vermieden wird. Keinesfalls darf dieses Instrument mit der Aussicht verbunden sein, die kostenfreie Zuteilung von Zertifikaten abzuschaffen oder Anlass sein, auf eine vollumfängliche Strompreiskompensation zu verzichten.

To enable it to play this role, it is necessary, as part of a strong European industrial strategy, to support the long-term development of low-carbon technologies and to preserve the competitiveness of industry until our major trading partners commit themselves to an ambitious climate policy, including a carbon constraint equivalent to that of European industry.

Overall, it would encourage increased international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In its relations with its international partners, the EU must seek to minimise distortions of competition with imports from third countries where climate rules are less strict.

The chosen carbon leakage measures need to provide carbon leakage protection for products on the EU market as well as for products intended to export. The EU ETS, with its free allocation principle and indirect cost compensation framework until 2030, is an appropriate tool for mitigating domestic GHG emissions of the EU industry and providing carbon leakage protection. Any future measures would therefore need to be as effective as the EU ETS free allocation and indirect compensation system both for importing and exporting sectors, while avoiding any retaliation risks on industry.

A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is a trade-restrictive instrument which entails risks of possible unintended and far-reaching consequences especially for exporting sectors. Unless complemented by offsets of carbon cost for exporting sectors, such mechanism does not provide carbon leakage protection for export: as non-EU companies do not have to pay for their CO2 emission for products sold in their home market, the EU-company cannot pass on its EU-ETS CO2 costs to exported products delivered to non-EU consumers. Without carbon leakage protection by free allocation and indirect compensation, EU producers will lose market share outside the EU.  Moreover, there is a risk of retaliation action by non-EU countries, again affecting the exporting sectors. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to assess whether a CBAM is needed, desirable and feasible over the longer term and which instrument at the border or at end consumer level could address unequal climate cost burden the best for the EU as net exporting continent. In this framework, essenscia requests an in-depth reflection on carbon pricing policies in general and on all possible policy options that would help mitigate carbon and investment leakage for exposed industries. Such system should focus on a carbon signal in production and consumption. 

We do agree that the CBAM should align with the EU’s trade acquis, and should be WTO compatible. The EU will remain open to and depend upon international free and fair trade and will have to engage in dialogue with its trading partners in order to avoid trade conflicts. In case the CBAM is not applied to finished goods due to the complexity of the model but more to upstream goods of activities, it will be important for the impact assessment to calculate the estimated increased costs of the CBAM throughout the value chain, and whether this in turn would result in an increased import of finished goods in Europe. Moreover, our industry is a net exporter and therefore any new system should reinforce EU’s strengths in the global chemical industry as well as downstream value chains. The system should be balanced for import and export and should therefore foresee a rebate for exported goods. Limiting the CBAM to a selection of sectors will distort the level the playing field within EU-ETS (when applying a CSCF) and could on top lead to possible retaliation measures that will affect non-concerned sectors. 

Any chosen option should not unnecessarily increase compliance costs or add administrative burden for the chemical and life sciences industry as well as competent authorities. There is currently no system in place neither in the EU nor at global level to determine and compare the carbon footprint of domestic and foreign products and/or producers. A robust monitoring, reporting and verification will need to be established ensuring legal certainty and equal treatment of international competitors.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBA) that the European Commission (EC) is considering introducing has a risk of seriously affecting free trade under the global economy based on the global supply chain. We oppose the introduction of CBA because it is unlikely to be an effective global warming countermeasure commensurate with such the risk.
From the viewpoint of the steel industry’s measures against global warming, CBA will only impose an economic burden equal in legislative requirement to that in the EU on steel products imported from outside of the EU and may not facilitate actual CO2 emission reduction such as improving the efficiency of steel production equipment in exporters. Of course, countries that do not export to the EU have no influence.
In the Inception Impact Assessment, “the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism, for selected sectors, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage.” is described. Even if the mechanism is introduced in the steel industry and as a result, the export of steel products from third countries and regions to the EU decreases and steel manufacturers in the EU can produce steel to make up for the decrease, but the amount of steel produced by them is around 44 million tons/year (actual figures of the EU’s import from outside the EU in 2018) which is only 2.4% of a world crude steel production of approximately 1.8 billion tons, which is very far from the solution for global warming mitigation. On the contrary, as a result of the limited production of these exporters, CBA may eat into the exporters’ financial resources allocated for the introduction and development of technologies for CO2 emission reduction and even have the adverse effect of hindering the progress of measures taken by them in countries and regions concerned.
The key of global warming countermeasures lies in technology. Effective measures backed by technology are indispensable, rather than CBA that may cause adverse effects such as trade friction.
If the EC’s true aim is to promote measures against global warming, it is important in the short or medium term to improve energy efficiency in the steel industry on a global scale by applying best available technologies (BATs) in energy saving and CO2 emission reduction that have already been put into practical use to facilities in operation and facilities that are to be newly established or added. And at the same time, it is important to contribute in the development and practical realization of innovative low/zero-carbon technologies for the future.
Regarding the implementation of BATs, the “2-Degree Scenario (SDS)” in the IEA’s WEO 2018 recommends that a total of US$ 16 trillion needs to be invested for introduction of BATs in the world from 2018 to 2040, and it is recognized as urgent and executable challenge.
Steel production will grow not in the EU but in Asian regions including India and ASEAN countries, where population and economic growth is expected. The effort to the implementation of technologies for energy saving and CO2 emission reduction to these countries and regions will be the key to the steel industry’s measures against global warming.
The Japanese steel industry has engaged in activities to promote the spread of BATs such as coke dry-quenching (CDQ) and blast furnace top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT) to the world. The global CO2 emission reduction effect due to the spread of such key energy saving facilities reached 65 million tons per year as of 2018. We are promoting such activities with its counterparts in India and ASEAN countries through governmental and private-sector workshops etc. to reduce CO2 emissions by the spread of BATs.
We believe that developing innovative technologies and spreading BATs to developing countries are important missions as an environmentally advanced nation, and will continue to expand these efforts in the future.",,,anonymous,,,closed,7587254,

This debate is essential in the context of preserving both the environmental integrity of EU climate policies as well as the competitiveness of European industry.

Preventing carbon leakage and its impacts

The power sector already observes problems of carbon leakage. Data available show that 21 TWh of coal-based electricity has been imported to the EU in 2019. Countries along the EU external borders are the most affected by imports of electricity with high carbon content, mainly the Baltic States, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Poland and Spain.

In the context of greater climate ambitions, The European industry exposed to international competition could be negatively impacted. Additionally, social and employment impacts resulting from this distortion should be further assessed. The European industry must be able to compete in a level playing field in order to fully endorse decarbonisation efforts.  

A carbon border adjustment primary goal is to prevent environmental harm. Addressing carbon leakage would first allow European industry to implement low carbon solutions without regret. A carbon border adjustment would also induce greater mitigation efforts by indirectly incentivizing investments in carbon clean products in third countries and allowing the spread of meaningful carbon pricing. 

The design of a carbon border adjustment requires careful considerations

There are several options for implementing a carbon border adjustment and these are not mutually exclusive. However, any type of mechanism must avoid opposition in principle from third countries and strictly respect international trade rules. 

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms are legally compatible with GATT and WTO rules, provided they are designed in a right way. The criteria to ensure compliance with the EU’s international commitments should be evaluated. Precedent WTO cases show that a carbon border adjustment need to be implemented in a transparent way and respect the key principles of fairness, proportionality and non-discrimination.
 
Therefore, the European Commission should carefully assess the scope and coverage of a carbon border adjustment and ensure that the most exposed sectors are subject to this measure. A mechanism in the power sector would be easy to design because tracing carbon emissions is relatively straightforward. Different design and benchmarking methods could be needed in other energy-intensive sectors in order to limit the administrative burden of a carbon border adjustment. A careful design of this policy instrument is key to maximize positive effects and tailored methods are essential for success. 

Ultimately, the ideal outcome to prevent carbon leakage lies in a greater international cooperation and a more global carbon pricing. Eurelectric supports the European Commission for engaging the international community with ambitious carbon pricing policy frameworks.

Additionally, Eurelectric has evaluated ways to implement carbon border adjustment with the help of its climate experts and would be happy to discuss it further.

All carbon border adjustment proposals rely on some degree of assessment of the carbon intensity of the electricity. This inevitably introduces a significant administrative burden on all flows of electricity, whether they are zero-carbon or from the most polluting forms. These measures typically rely on some form of national measure of carbon intensity together with exemptions for products for lower than average carbon intensities. This means that the most burdensome regulations to prove eligibility for exemptions fall upon the lowest carbon intensity products. The changing nature of the electricity market, in particular the increasing proportion of weather dependent variable generation from wind and solar, means such carbon intensity varies significantly, and this – rather than a simple average would need to be taken into account.

Such an administrative burden will disincentivise the cross-border trade in low carbon intensity products. As a result, low carbon products could be replaced with higher carbon intensity imports (the most carbon intensive products which pay a carbon border adjustment on only the lower national average measure will perversely benefit the most) or by higher intensity EU production. This cannot be to the benefit of EU consumers or the EU’s efforts against climate change.

Next Steps

We agree that a detailed examination of a border carbon tax adjustment should be taken forward.

We would suggest that the following key principles are followed:

• Border carbon adjustments must accurately define the carbon content of the import, recognising all of the potential variations in carbon content;

• Border carbon adjustments must not present an undue administrative burden on imports and especially low carbon imports such that any perceived benefits in carbon reduction are outweighed;

• Border Carbon Adjustments should not act to “skew” domestic markets against cross-border trade

• The efficacy of a border carbon adjustment in reducing carbon emissions in the producing nation must be assessed accurately prior to implementation.

Achieving climate neutrality will prove to be an unprecedented challenge for the European Union.

The objective of climate neutrality within the European Union by 2050 will require major efforts from all economic sectors in the Union. Energy-intensive industries such as cement, lime and steel are key industrial chains for the European economy, and their pathway towards net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be technically and economically challenging. 

CCS and CCU technologies can help support a just transition for its citizens and regions, allowing for a cost-efficient and environmentally safe decarbonisation pathway while maintaining productivity and competitiveness across European industries, creating new jobs and preserving existing ones. However, a range of technological, policy and regulatory measures will need to be put in place for the European Union to meet its climate objectives. 

The European Union will need to ensure that a transition to a low-carbon economy in a cost-efficient way. Europe has technological solutions that will need to be urgently deployed and scaled up to create a European CO2 transport and storage infrastructure. With European storage sites, European CO2 transport and storage infrastructure and European workforce, the industrial transition can be done. The large-scale deployment of technologies such as CCS and CCU will need to be supported through an adequate policy and regulatory framework, addressing the shortcomings of the existing legislation. 

A carbon border adjustment mechanism – important to achieve a level playing field and decrease the risk of carbon leakage.

In absence of a global price for carbon and until countries align on climate ambitions, a carbon border adjustment mechanism will be needed in the European Union to achieve a level playing field between European and international producers. Such a carbon border adjustment mechanism could decrease the risk of carbon leakage in key industrial value chains and support their decarbonisation pathway. 

A carbon border adjustment mechanism should be designed to comply with the EU’s trade agreements, as well as Wold Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, and in a manner which works seamlessly with the climate legislation it aims to adjust for. Accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in this respect.  

The current EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) has not yet been aligned with the target of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. When revised, it will be crucial to ensure a functioning cap and trade system that delivers an adequate carbon price. In parallel, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) must be adjusted to the same level of ambition, so that same conditions are applied to all actors and society as a whole.  

To incentivise investments in R&I, pilot projects and demonstration projects, there is a need for an effective carbon price which support and develops European industrial and technological leadership on low-carbon technologies such as CCS and CCU. 

To summarise, a carbon border adjustment mechanism may ultimately lead towards a low-carbon European industrial sector, supporting the European Union’s pathway towards net-zero by 2050.

The CBA combines the defence of employment and the fight against climate change
This CBA cannot stop at taking into account direct emissions from the production of products. It must incorporate indirect emissions from the production of energy and raw materials necessary for their development. This is a requirement for the electric vehicle battery industry that France and Germany are building. Encouraging virtuous production in countries supplying primary raw materials reinforces the merits of this approach, while encouraging the relocation of production throughout the sector.

Thus, Member States emit little CO2 because they have deindustrialised and their imported emissions are rising sharply, without participating in the emergence of

L’Ajustement Carbone aux Frontières (ACF) est une alternative efficace à la taxe carbone pour
lutter contre la concurrence déloyale, estiment des experts du dialogue social européen.
Le prix du CO2 pèse négativement sur la compétitivité des industries européennes de la
première transformation. Cette situation résulte de « l’exception UE », seule zone
économique à donner un prix aux émissions de CO2 de ses industries énergivores. Elle
induit une concurrence déloyale, dont les effets se font sentir à court comme à long

sur le marché européen comme à l‘export. L’ajustement carbone aux frontières égalise les conditions d‘exploitation des industries,
sur le marché européen comme à l‘export.
Cet ajustement carbone, dans sa version la plus immédiate et simple d’application,
consiste à demander aux importateurs de matières premières soumises à l’ETS (marché
du carbone européen) comme l’acier, l’aluminium, le ciment… d’acheter les quotas
d’émissions de CO2 correspondant à leur performance carbone sur le marché, comme
tous les producteurs européens le font depuis 2008. Lors de sa prise de fonction en tant
que présidente de la Commission européenne, Ursula von der Leyen l’a clairement
envisagé. Il est également réclamé par certains industriels.
Cette mesure alternative à la taxe carbone pour les émetteurs concentrés de CO2

Compétitivité préservée 
Cet outil permet de conjuguer la défense de l’emploi (et particulièrement des emplois
qualifiés) et la lutte contre le changement climatique. Remplacer de l’acier, de
l’aluminium, du papier, de l’essence, voire du ciment, produits en Europe par leurs
substituts de source asiatique ou américaine, est générateur d’émissions de CO2 très
nettement supérieures. En second lieu, son impact sur les prix à la consommation, et
donc sur le pouvoir d’achat des Européens, s’avère être faible. Il serait compris entre 100
et 150 euros sur le prix d’un véhicule, pour un prix ETS du CO2 de 30 euros la tonne. Les
constructeurs automobiles européens peuvent donc dormir sur leurs deux oreilles, leur
compétitivité ne s’en trouvera pas menacée.
L’ACF  permet de conjuguer la défense de l’emploi et la lutte contre le changement climatique
Cet ACF ne saurait s’arrêter à la prise en compte des émissions directes de la fabrication des produits. Il doit intégrer les émissions indirectes dues à la production de l’énergie et des matières premières nécessaires à leur élaboration. Il s’agit d’une exigence pour la filière industrielle des batteries pour véhicules électriques que la France et l’Allemagne sont en train de bâtir. Encourager les productions vertueuses dans les pays fournisseurs de matières premières primaires renforce le bien-fondé de la démarche, tout en incitant à la relocalisation des productions tout au long de la filière. Et pourtant, les résistances d'ordre idéologique sont encore vivaces au nom du libre-échange et de la croissance
économique mondiale,  ne reposant sur aucun  objectif mais sur une vision du monde devenue obsolète.Tout a radicalement changé en 2001 avec l’entrée de la Chine dans l’OMC, signe fort du bouleversement de l’économie mondiale. D’indicateur de développement, le CO2 s’est progressivement mué en facteur de désindustrialisation dans les pays de la triade. Ainsi, des Etats membres émettent peu de CO2 car ils ont désindustrialisé et voient leurs émissions importées grimper en flèche, sans participer à l’émergence de
solutions productives durables. L’ACF fait partie de ces solutions, il en est une première étape.

Montenegro, as a country heavily dependent on coal energy production, is therefore depend on the only thermal power plant it has, located in Pljevlja Municipality – responsible for the major economic, environmental and social issues that Montenegro is facing. 
Even though Montenegro introduced cap and trade system for main CO2 emitters, following the adoption of Law on Protection from the negative impacts of climate change, planned free allowances referring only to the Montenegrin NDC from 2017, with the 1990s baseline, which is insufficiently ambitious. Most of the free allowances are planned for the Pljevlja plant. This year NDC will be revised, hence making the reduction of allowances by 1.5% per year until 2030 lacking in serious ambition, as well failing to achieve EU’s climate ambition to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by 50-55% from 1990 levels by 2030. (see http://www.caneurope.org/publications/press-releases/1889-montenegro-s-cap-and-trade-system-could-signal-end-of-free-emissions-in-western-balkans-but-cap-needs-tightening). On the other hand, it is uncertain how affectively the cap and trade system will further be implemented, and will that be at a level which serves as a real incentive to decarbonize.  
Since the Pljevlja plant has chosen the opt-out from the Large Combustion Plant Directive, now has less than 7000 working hours left, but it is still uncertain whether the envisaged ecological reconstruction of the thermal power plant will result in emission reductions, and whether the mentioned reconstruction will occur at all, therefore the need for introducing a border tax is even more urgent. 
Introducing carbon border adjustment mechanism would: Encourage Montenegro to continue focusing on the process of decarbonisation and at the same time resolving a three decades long air pollution issues; Contribute to solving EUs problem of carbon leakage in the electricity sector; Remove unfair competition from non-compliant and highly polluting plants in non-EU countries that trade electricity with EU and neighboring countries; Fill in the authority gap inside the Energy Community Treaty and support the Energy Community Secretariat in discouraging Montenegro (and other Balkan countries) in planning any future investments in coal and prolonging life of the thermal power plant; Impose as another very strong reason for phasing out coal and accelerate just and sustainable transition in Montenegro (as well as the other Balkan countries). 
In addition, Montenegro is working on becoming a member of the EU, and it will be very challenging to align with EU legislation in the future due to the EU’s increased efforts on fighting climate change, if Montenegro do not intensifies its efforts now and start planning decarbonisation of the energy sector and start developing steps right away to a complete end of coal dependence.

Not surprisingly, it included an upcoming proposal for a ""carbon adjustment mechanism at the Union's borders"", an innovation designed to align the EU's trade policy with its decarbonisation objective. The issue of border adjustment, which for the last ten years has regularly reappeared on the European political agenda, is making a strong comeback in a context where the EU has decided to move towards carbon neutrality by 2050, and where many industrial sectors are increasingly concerned regarding the impact that this objective will have on their competitiveness. In its Communication of 11 December 2019, the Commission proposed a response to address these concerns by targeting the sectors that emit the most CO2 and are therefore most likely to be affected by ambitious measures to reduce these emissions.
The logic of this approach is mainly linked to the will to avoid the carbon leakage that is likely to occur when carbon price differentials lead to a relocation of the most emitting activities to regions with more permissive legislation. With lower carbon prices, carbon leakage could be considered limited. As soon as we move towards a significant increase in carbon prices on the European market, the risk of carbon leakage can no longer be underestimated.

The heightening of the carbon leakage phenomenon would pose a significant problem as it would counteract efforts to reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale. As a net CO2 importing region wherein carbon emissions from imported products account for approximately 30% of domestic CO2 production, a border adjustment would prove to be relevant for the European Union’s climate objectives, albeit potentially negative for some of its trading partners, those particularly affected being least developed countries and exporters of carbon-intensive products.

This paper reviews the technical and political difficulties behind the recent position of IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at the World Economic Forum in Davos on 23 January 2020, who publicly expressed concerns about the implementation of such a measure. With the
support of the European Climate Foundation, this paper - the third in the series ""Greening EU trade policy"" - also takes stock of past attempts and reviews the legal and political criteria that need to be met for the adjustment mechanism to effectively meet its objectives. While recalling that an increase in the domestic price per tonne of carbon and the abolition of the free allocation system are necessary prerequisites for any corrective measures of a commercial nature, this note concludes that the European Commission should work towards a progressive mechanism parallel and equivalent to the EU ETS. This mechanism should initially target electricity and cement and then be extended to additional products subject to carbon pricing in the EU, subsequently paving the way for carbon pricing system convergences among trading partners

This is Sandbag’s response to the March 2020 open feedback invitation launched by the European Commission on the topic of the introduction of Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs). This policy tool is part of the current Commission President’s political mandate for 2019-2024 and of the EU Green Deal, as well as it is part of the EU Industrial Strategy. Our organisation’s response summarises the conclusions of our recent research work on BCAs.   

It draws on analysis in Sandbag’s two recent reports on BCAs, published in December 2019 , which both provide further details on the issues covered here. 

Conclusion on BCA from previous research: BCAs appear to be the most direct and best option for addressing the issue of creating a level playing field for EU industry on their way to developing net zero processes.

The EU Climate Law presented in March 2020 introduces the net-zero economy into EU law. It focuses on the importance of a trajectory as a means to reach this goal. This transition is imperative and requires urgent action, the longer we delay the bigger the burden left on industry, which would otherwise need to deliver a whole system change in less than 20 years (i.e. by pushing a change in the system post 2030). 

The EU ETS is the only currently standing policy in the EU with its built in trajectory and will be of fundamental importance in capping emissions to ensure the net-zero goal is reached. Currently covering industry and power generation, it is clear that the trajectory will bring both to the same end point by 2050, even though looking at the past and next decade it is quite clear that industry has been lagging behind, partly due to the built in counter incentives the ETS has created for EU industry.

Free allocation of EUAs has been used until now to address the so-called “risk or carbon leakage” in industries covered by the EUETS.  This system is flawed in several respects .  Nevertheless, the use of free allocation combined with the low prices for EUAs prevailing for much of the last decade has meant that there is no evidence of significant leakage to date. 

However, it is clear that free allocation is not sustainable into the long term and the cancellation mechanism built into the Market Stability Reserve of the EU ETS further strengthens this principle.  As the EUETS cap declines, eventually towards net-zero by 2050, there will be fewer and fewer allowances to allocate.  Our analysis shows that this is problem is likely to make full continuation free allocation unsustainable sometime in the early 2030s. However, giving industry an incentive to reduce emissions as well as a guarantee of a level playing field only in 2030 is too late. Action is needed now and it is clear that a Border Carbon Adjustment could be a good policy tool to transition EU industry outside of the free allocation regime already in the second phase of Phase 4 of the EU ETS.

If the carbon costs of EU industry cannot be lowered, the only alternative that adequately addresses the risk of carbon leakage is to raise the cost of emissions embodied in imports.  Direct financial subsidies to all EU producers to compensate for their carbon costs is not a realistic option for a variety of reasons. Zero carbon production, which would not incur a carbon price, would be another solution but it is not realistic in the short to medium term, especially for existing production.

This means that some form of BCA will in any case be required.

1) If introduced, the BCA must be implemented as an alternative to free allocation and within a wider set of policies to ensure the decarbonisation of industry

2) WWF EPO recognises that the BCA could play different catalyzer roles in contributing to EU’s industrial decarbonisation, and influence third countries to join the club, by: raising revenues, act as an incentive for trading partners to implement their own carbon pricing measures, and encourage current non-compliant third-countries partners to take action in complying with EU environmental norms & protections. 

3) However, this highly depends on how the BCA will be designed and whether it will be based on the current carbon price. In the absence of an effective carbon price , the implementation of a BCA cannot guarantee that it will play an important role in driving the EU industry’s decarbonisation. Only with a significant and rising carbon price, a BCA could really encourage investments in low-carbon technologies both in the EU and internationally  and potentially act on prices for commodities. In the current COVID-19 context, the carbon price is sinking and has reached its lowest levels since July 2018 (16 euros per tonne), and will barely recover in 2020. Stabilising the ETS price, at an effective level, seems to be a priority prior to implement any BCA. The fall of the EU ETS price will have an impact on public income from auctioning revenues and therefore on the funding of the Innovation fund. Measures to ensure that rapid carbon price falls are avoided need to be introduced for the phase four of the ETS (2021-2030). 

4) Despite the implementation of a carbon leakage list  by the European Commission (EC) for sectors qualified at risk, the evidence for the occurrence of carbon leakage as defined by the EU ETS Directive and due to its implementation has been extensively argued. Our diagnosis is that, in the absence of a significant carbon price, there is a risk of an investment leakage rather than a carbon leakage in Europe. 

5) If a BCA is considered as an instrument to mitigate carbon leakage, its impact should be evaluate in a full assessment on all carbon leakage options in order to allow comparison between those options. 

6) In designing a BCA, we ask that, such measure should: 
• Be designed and implemented as an alternative to free allocation of allowances in the ETS. A phase-in of BCA needs to be linked to phase out free allocation.The EC Communication on the European Green Deal is proposing the BCA as an alternative to free allocation. We support this proposal; 
• Be designed in a way that it would cover only energy-intensive sectors under EU ETS, mainly steel, cement, and basic chemicals; 
• Be part of a wider set of policies to enable and promote the investment in low carbon industrial processes, energy efficiency measures and renewable energies to achieve the decarbonisation of industry. The introduction of BCA is not the solution to tackle the lack of investment in low-carbon technologies. In order to build a successful low carbon industry within the EU, it is key to develop a clear policy framework containing the following measures: 
-a strong public innovation policy targeted towards market introduction of low carbon technologies, which will ensure investments in low carbon technologies through a robust innovation fund and exclude support for fossil lock-in technologies
-contracts for difference or alternative measures such as subsidies to mitigate investment risks and support heavy industries dealing with the higher operational costs of low carbon technologies
-obligation to purchase low carbon materials through public procurement and introduction of norms, quotas and standards for low carbon materials to create a lead market for low carbon technologies",,1414929419-24,withinfo,ngo,small,closed,7587254,

EDF encourages Europe to leverage its single market to encourage more ambitious global climate ambition and a more pro-climate interpretation of WTO rules. Because of the strength of the EU single market as an export market, border carbon adjustments (BCAs) would encourage GHG emission pricing in EU trading partners and give the EU an additional lever for increasing other countries’ ambition on climate.

Based on the economics literature (Cosbey et al, 2019) and experience, EDF recommends a narrow sectoral coverage of the BCA mechanism focused on energy intensive trade exposed sectors, and including natural gas.

The BCA mechanism is an alternative to the EU’s current free allocation of allowances to address carbon leakage in the ETS. EDF recommends forthcoming impact analysis to include: 

- assessment of the different options for addressing carbon leakage such as free allowances, BCAs or a combination of both (e.g., using free allowances for products destined for exports);

- the distributional impact and environmental benefits of the increased public revenues from the removal of free allocation combined with increased prices on both domestic and foreign produced goods in the affected sectors. 

BCAs can have a distributional effect across countries. To focus on the environmental motivation for a BCA mechanism, and to ensure it is not seen as punitive toward developing economies, EDF recommends the impact analysis review potential effects of earmarking BCA revenues to climate and energy related purposes, with most of the funds used to support developing countries affected by the BCAs.  One potential mechanism for such transfers would be to use the revenues to pay for high quality Internationally Traded Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.  Financing ITMOs will ensure the BCA revenues are used towards additional verifiable emission reductions.  

EDF recommends BCAs based on existing sectoral carbon footprint benchmarks. 

The BCA mechanism may allow for credits on imports for GHG prices paid in the origin country. Correspondingly, the BCA mechanism could also allow for a credit on exported goods destined to export markets without equivalent climate policies (equivalent to current free allowances under EU ETS but now only for exported goods). 

EDF also wants to emphasise the importance of  leveraging the Union’s market position as the world’s largest gas importer to addressing methane emissions from the EU’s natural gas supply chain, including from imports. Best available data suggests that the largest share of the EU’s methane footprint from natural gas are upstream emissions in the supply chain for natural gas imported to the EU. To reduce this footprint, the EU should adopt a mandatory performance standard for all gas sold in the EU market, including from imports, of maximum 0.20% upstream methane intensity by 2025. 

For natural gas, EDF recommends the EU consider applying a methane emission price on both imported and domestically produced gas with the following no-regret features in the early phase:

- use the IPCC Tier 1 emission factors for natural gas systems (using the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines) to establish default methane emission intensity estimates per unit of natural gas;

- allow producers a proportional reduction on the level of the methane payment on their gas if they provide certified, credible, third-party verified data on emission intensity representative of all their production facilities, with the underlying calculations made public;

- grant credits towards EU methane emissions payments for any emissions price already paid in the production country on the condition that such payments can be verified in fiscal registries and are based on third-party verified and appropriately sampled measurements of methane emissions per above.

We do not support a carbon border adjustment mechanism on the basis that it: 
- does not ‘protect’ the EU economy, 
- is not in the interest of consumers and wider society, and  
- it does not create the positive political conditions and framework needed to build a global consensus to tackle the climate crisis. 

The following aspects must be take into consideration in the impact assessment and any subsequent policy design:

a) Politics: Protectionist measures tend to sour political discourse, trust and confidence in delivering the end goal of decarbonisation to stay below 1.5 degrees. For example, Narenrada Modi, Indian Prime Minister, stated “there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others” at the opening of COP21 where agreement was reached on a new global climate architecture. The US Commerce Secretary Wilbour Ross warned “Depending on what form the carbon tax takes, we will react to it” whilst He Jiankun from Tsinghua University, a delegate for the Chinese government, stated ""Currently adopting this type of cross-border measure could influence the friendly atmosphere of cooperation in the process of confronting climate change.""  The EU impact assessment must outline border measures advance trust, cooperation and international efforts to accelerate climate action. 

b) A credible threat? The EU introduced a carbon border measure for all international air travel arriving and departing from the EU in 2009. Significant global political pressure from the US, China and India crushed this measure. President Obama approved the Thune Bill which prohibited US airlines from complying with the EU ETS Aviation legislation. China and India also did the same with their airlines. China then threatened to delay and possibly cancel its order for 55 Airbus planes, which ultimately forced the French government to seek a delay to in the enforcement of EU legislation.    There is no indication that the EU is in a stronger position to fend off these countries as well as Brazil, Russia and others, and this time on three sectors. Failure would render the whole exercise worthless, damage the EU’s credibility and isolate it at a time when it must drive global cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.  

c) Asymmetrical retaliation: China delaying and threatening to cancel Airbus orders was an example of direct retaliation confined to the same sector. Most trade war retaliation is asymmetrical. For example, China stopped purchasing US agricultural products namely soybeans, the most valuable American crop export, in response to US tariffs on Chinese steel imports. This hammered the $9.1 billion yearly export market but the plight of farmers cost the US economy $28 billion for just two years of compensation. Furthermore, the steel tariffs are expected to cost US dairy famers $12.8 billion by 2023.  The EU’s impact assessment will have to calculate the potential economic impact of retaliatory measures across the EU economy. 

d) Competition concerns: Cement and steel, two of the sectors expected to benefit from a CBAM have a long history of anti-trust and price fixing in the EU. This has done considerable harm to the functioning of the Internal Market, public policy and citizens considerable harm. If a few companies can control access to the EU or national markets it implies that they are not truly exposed to domestic or international competition undermining the case for border measures in the first place.     Examples of cartels include: i) The ‘Cembureau Agreement’;  iii) The ‘Thyssenkrupp, Voestalpine, Vossloh and Mora cartel in Germany; iv) ‘Club Europe’ steel cartel which ran from 1984 to 2002.

Given the expected potential higher climate ambition for 2030, we recognize that additional and improved carbon leakage provisions may be needed. However, we believe that alternative measures than proposed CBAM-options (in the IIA) are needed and we give our analysis of the strength and weaknesses of the proposed 4 options in the attached file. Our proposal is, that EU should research and develop a different way to strengthen the existing carbon leakage measures bearing in mind the basic principles laid out at the end of our reaction.

As a contribution by the Finnish Steel and Metal Producers we would like to offer our view on the basic mandatory principles to be incorporated to the possible system:
1.	It is necessary that the system provides strong international incentives to decarbonise manufacturing conditions in third countries, but in the first place this requires an EU CBA which provides a level playing field with third country producers which are not subject to the same environmental constraints.  
2.	Any CBA regime must be based on the actual carbon footprint of imported products, i.e. not a simple average benchmark or ad valorem, for example.  In other words, a product with a high carbon footprint must be taxed materially higher than a similar product with a materially lower carbon footprint.  
3.	To ensure proper incentives for third countries, any EU carbon pricing system, including a CBA mechanism, should not apply to products exported from the EU. 
4.	A carbon border adjustment mechanism must not replace, and a priori any transitional period of partial CBA application must not endanger:
 •	An effective EU trade policy, including existing ordinary import duties and trade defense measures (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and 
        safeguards);
•	Existing EU carbon leakage measures, i.e. ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation until a CBA mechanism is fully in place and 
        seen to be effective;
•	Currently applied EU indirect cost compensation, to the extent the CBA mechanism does not effectively cover the entire supply chain, 
        including energy inputs;
•	EU regulatory relief foreseen in the State Aid Guidelines on Energy and Environment (EEAG). 
5.	While the avoidance of additional administrative burdens is important, an effective CBA mechanism requires a legitimate and robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for collecting and disclosing the direct and indirect emissions of the affected products. The effectiveness of the mechanism will depend on the details of its design and its ability to adapt in the face of absorption and source shifting. 
6.	Throughout the process of putting in place a comprehensive CBA mechanism, transparency and close dialogue with trading partners will be important.  
7.	To be coherent with the objective of the CBA, and the EU climate policy objectives in general, funds raised from the CBA should be used primarily to encourage investments in carbon-reducing technologies. Some of the funds raised could be used to provide assistance for (low-income) consumers to ease consumer burdens and increase societal support for the arrangements.

Bosnia & Herzegovina is currently strongly dependent on coal with 70% of electricity coming from thermal power plants, and is planning to add new capacities, with a plan to export coal generated power, including to EU markets. Coal electricity producers in B&H are severely subsidised by the state (as was shown in the Energy Community Secretariat analysis from 2019), resulting in market distortions, consumption patterns and long-term viability of systems relying on coal-fired power production. 
Next to the economic downsides as well as corruption issues plaguing coal TPPs in BiH, their environmental track record has been disastrous, with clear violations of the EIA procedures - LCPD, enshrined in both domestic laws as well as the Energy Community Treaty legislation. Power plants in Bosnia & Herzegovina are far from compliant with this legislation, as a 2019 report shows that thermal power plants in B&H were polluting nine times more than their allowed ceiling, violating obligations spanning from the Large Combustion Plants Directive which went into force on January 1st same year. (see Bankwatch’s report Comply or close, Decembe 2019).
Bosnia and Herzegovina plans to build more new coal power plants, some of which are in clear contradiction with environmental and State aid rules of EU and EnCom. Most of the previously produced feasibility studies do not contain an assumption (or underestimate the price) of aa carbon tax or CBAM (in case of exports). Such false economic justification will produce plants heading a future where they face either a shut down or further operation with loss, addicted to state subsidies. Both scenarios are at a detriment to B&H’s economy and will leave its citizens indebted. A CBAM would be an additional stimulus for an introduction of a domestic CO2 pricing mechanism, leading to an energy transition in B&H, in line with future membership in post-Green New Deal EU.
All of the above argumentation has in so far not managed to change the stakeholders’ minds on coal development, due to the plans for future export. However, carbon taxing policies, be it domestic ETS or CBAM has a clear potential to be the straw which breaks the camel's back and a final impetus for a clean energy transition in B&H. Given that EU accession for B&H is not expected within the next few years at least, this is too long to wait for the introduction of carbon pricing. Action has to be taken now. The Energy Community Treaty Contracting Parties need to introduce a carbon price. In the electricity sector, a CBAM tax would encourage ETS countries to continue their phase-out of coal and prevent carbon leakage from non-ETS countries. However, as the Balkan governments have an ask in this matter, chances are it will be strongly countered and if accepted, it will take a long time. An EU CBAM would be the first palpable carbon pricing scheme the Balkan governments would face, and certainly a strong wake up call.
In addition, due to the EU’s increased efforts on climate, for a country like B&H that is  planning to join the EU, it would be rather difficult to align with EU legislation in the future if the work on this  matter doesn’t start right away by developing step by step, as well as by avoiding a financial coal lock-in.
Finally, the introduction of carbon pricing in B&H would:
-Encourage B&H to become more ambitious in the process of decarbonisation
-Contribute to solving EUs problem of carbon leakage in the electricity sector
-Remove unfair competition from non-compliant and highly polluting plants in non-EU countries that trade electricity with EU and neighboring countries
-Fill in the authority gap inside the Energy Community Treaty and support the Energy Community Secretariat in discouraging B&H (and other Balkan countries) plans for new coal projects.

With regards to the main objective, we welcome the Commission's endeavour to seek the ways to design the mechanism which can ""[fight] climate change by avoiding carbon leakage"".  As the fight against climate change needs to be global, the measure can be an opportunity for the EU to project its climate leadership globally. It is equally important to consider the EU's existing internal climate targets (by 2030, and climate neutrality potentially by 2050). When designing the measure, it is therefore important to consider the impacts of the measure on both these EU internal targets (greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy production), and global CO2 reduction ambitions, and ""to prevent environmental harm"" as stated in the inception report. The European response to the growing gap between countries’ climate ambitions shall be comprehensive and may among other things include progressive market standards for carbon intensity of traded goods and/or promotion of multilateral arrangements which would ensure the enforcement of similar carbon regulation in the majority of jurisdictions. 

Further developing and strengthening of the European carbon policy can also be achieved through the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). If properly designed it may become an additional option in providing an effective carbon leakage protection. 

Regardless of the policy instruments suggested by the Commission in the CBAM impact assessment report (i.e. a carbon tax on selected products – both on imported and domestic products; a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports; the extension of the EU ETS to imports), what is paramount is that the measure should enable a level playing field in which the 'polluter pays' – a cornerstone of EU environmental policy enshrined in Art 191 TFEU. 

For the steel sector in particular, the final measure then needs to do two things:
1.	The scope of the measure needs to cover the full steel value chain starting from the raw materials the production of which is often carbon intensive
2.	The measure needs to enable an individual adjustment based on the actual carbon intensity of the producer

With regards to the first point, the scope of the measure needs to include the full steel value chain, from upstream raw materials to finished steel-containing products. Both direct and indirect CO2 emissions (including Scope 3) also need to be included to prevent further carbon leakage, even when the indirect segment is not yet subject to EU ETS. 

On the second point, adherent to the 'polluter pays' principle, it is critical that 'cleaner' third-country producers importing steel into the EU should be taxed less, and / or third-country producers with a CO2 footprint lower than the EU benchmark (however it is calculated) should be exempted. Otherwise, its duty should be adjusted. The 'polluter pays' principle could also be used to adjust the mechanism to incentivise producers whose CO2 footprint is better than that of the average EU producer, setting a clear stimulus for decarbonisation. This setup would not only contribute to negative carbon leakage (reducing emissions elsewhere), but also ensure that the EU preserves its capacity to achieve its internal climate targets, by stimulating a material import flow of cleaner materials from third regions.

To sum up, any border measure to be designed smartly needs to be inclusive in terms of product scope (start from the very upstream and cover as much downstream as possible) and be flexible in terms of accounting for the actual carbon intensity of the imported products to avoid carbon leakage.

ZPPS, Polish Glass Manufacturers Federation, brings together and represents at national and EU-level multinational firms and national companies producing glass and glass articles.

ZPPS welcomes the possibility to provide our initial feedback on the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We do not have a definitive position on many aspects of CBAM , but we want to raise the following:

1. CBAM has to be supplementary to the free allocation.
2. CBAM should be as simple as possible: importers should have to pay in cash.
3. For the pilot phase one should choose some sectors having big direct emissions, uniform products and high trade intensity. Most probably none of glass industry sectors will apply for such a status.
4. CBAM will only protect EU companies selling their products internally. With no draft it is not possible to be definitive, but net exporters should rather be compensated.
5. The mechanism should base on the average costs level that EU-producers face.
6. For most industrial sectors only CO2 should be considered in the future regulation. 
7. It is important to give industry a medium/long term vision. The ETS revision gave industry some certainty (including carbon leakage list and free allocation level) so we ask to maitain those rules. This 10 years period is important to maintain the current levels of investment and to attract new ones including low carbon technologies.
8. CBAM should act as general anti carbon leakage rule, to prevent producers exit from the EU.
9.  The funds raised with the CBAM should be reinvested in the EU low CO2 projects in industrial sector.

We wish to submit the attached in depth response to this consultation. A brief summary of the main arguments is provided below. 

1.	The EU discussion on anti-carbon leakage measures must not be allowed to distract from the broader objective of putting energy-intensive industry onto a pathway towards climate neutrality by 2050. To decarbonise energy-intensive industries, the EU requires a policy package of measures. These measures will need to: a) support the first commercial-scale sites using climate-neutral technology, b) create an enabling state aid framework, c) facilitate investment in key infrastructure and feedstocks (such as Hydrogen and CCS),

2.	In the present economic and geopolitical context, we believe that the risk of BCAs becoming a divisive and distracting issue to the rest of the industrial decarbonisation package is high. While we argue that a new carbon leakage protection system is necessary from the mid-2030s, currently several key conditions for BCAs to be implemented with a good chance of success are not in place. 

3.	Unless developed as part of a coalition with major trading partners, BCAs would likely encounter significant domestic and international political opposition, creating risks about the EU’s capacity to follow through with this policy. In the short term, taking this risk is unnecessary: the current system of benchmark based free allocation (plus indirect cost compensation) can, if combined with complementary decarbonisation support policies for industry, be reformed to offer effective carbon-leakage protection until the mid-2030s, if not longer.  

4.	However, in the medium-term – i.e. sometime between 2035 and 2040 - the system of free allocation will become unsustainable, as free allocation would consume 100% or more of total EU ETS cap. Even once fully decarbonised, climate neutral EU industries will still face higher production costs than conventional technologies. By this time, the EU will therefore need to shift to a longer term solution than free allocation. 

5.	Three long-term alternatives to free allocation exist to provide anti-leakage protection. The Commission should explore all three of these options to fully appreciate their respective costs and benefits. These three main options are: a) carbon product standards, applied to all domestically-produced or imported goods sold in the EU’s internal market b) Border carbon adjustments c) free allocation plus carbon-charge based approaches. 

6.	In our view, the best of the above three options for the EU would be to aim to implement climate-neutral product standards for all energy intensive basic materials sold in the EU’s market by around 2035. This would be simplest from a WTO-legal, administrative simplicity, and political-economy perspective.  Developing standards would provide the clearest and least uncertain signal for industry, thus doing most to facilitate the EU’s domestic transition. Climate neutral product standards could be set based on existing technological knowledge and enter into force between 2035-40, thus providing clarity for industrial investment today and replacing free allocation from that date.

Members of the Association are actively engaged in the international trade importing to the major steel markets, including to the EU. This is why the currently proposed unilateral and sector-specific CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) raises serious concerns within the Association. 
The CBAM is designed specifically to fight carbon leakage. Carbon leakage is defined as a situation where, due to growing environmental costs, such as EU ETS costs, EU businesses (1) loose EU and export markets in favour of cheaper carbon-intensive products, and (2) move production/investments to countries with lower or no emission reduction ambition and respective costs. 
Esteemed independent economists identify fundamental issues which completely remove the CBAM from the declared EU climate agenda and even the levelling playing field agenda, the latter being the main historical driver for the CBAM. In particular, economists credibly argue that carbon leakage is a far-fetched, if not a non-existent, issue because growing ETS costs are just a minor factor for businesses to move abroad. The economists further identify such serious issues as carbon absorption, source shifting and market distorting signals due to promotion of cost saving replacement of (1) imports of semi-finished goods or raw materials, such as steel slabs or billets for re-rolling/processing in the EU, with more value added finished goods, and (2) more expensive CBAM covered products with competing products of a CBAM non-covered sector with the same or even higher carbon footprint. The latter may have devastating effects on certain EU sectors and sub-sectors of economy, particularly downstream manufacturers.  
The above issues strongly indicate that the currently proposed CBAM does not serve its very purpose because it cannot fight carbon leakage, even if such phenomenon existed to the extent it is presented by some stakeholders. Moreover, such CBAM is likely to increase emissions in third countries. We know that the negative climate effect is the same regardless of whether CO2 emissions come from the EU, China or the USA. 
Esteemed international trade lawyers side with the economists cited above and loudly warn us that the proposed CBAM will lead to trade wars and further negative consequences for the EU economy due to massive and immediate retaliation of EU’s major trading partners. 
The EU intends to ascertain that the CBAM is fully WTO compliant. In such a case, a CBAM needs to be introduced and applied in the form of a carbon charge/levy/tax on all imported and domestic products with the same or similar carbon footprint per unit, depending upon such content and irrespective of an industrial sector. 
A WTO incompliant CBAM will be successfully challenged in the WTO, and EU’s trading partners will introduce massive retaliatory measures affecting various sectors of the EU economy. This retaliation may be immediate because the EU CBAM is likely to be treated as a disguised safeguard measure not compliant with the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. It is noteworthy that the EU rightly took this view with regard to the recent US Section 232 measures on steel and aluminium. 
To conclude, we are deeply concerned that the proposed unilateral and sector-specific CBAM does not serve the purpose and may turn out to be even counterproductive for both the climate change and competitiveness of EU industries. We invite all stakeholders to engage into an advanced dialogue and cooperation with a view to find the right way to achieve industrial decarbonisation in the EU and elsewhere. We believe that the EU and other industrial jurisdictions should jointly lead to create a binding multilateral mechanism to achieve decarbonisation of our planet.

Carbon border adjustment mechanism under is extremely sensitive element the Green Deal of the EU which should find delicate balance between different areas of policies, international law rules, economy on social development, including recent COVID-19 outbreak.
Since the EU is anchor trade partner for Ukraine, with more than 40 percent of share in its international trade, any model of Carbon border adjustment mechanism will immediately affect Ukraine.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that carbon border adjustment mechanism is in full compliance with WTO rules and the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, in particular rule on national treatment of goods.
Carbon border adjustment mechanism as well should reflect the level of cooperation of the EU with third states. In particular, it shall cover not only global international commitments. Lie Paris Accord, but other regional and bilateral arrangements on cooperation in environment, sustainable development, energy and trade, e.g. Ukrainian commitments on approximation of its legislation to the EU acquis in relevant spheres under the Energy Community Treaty or the Association Agreement.
The timing of adoption of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is relevant as well. It is obvious that the economy of the European Union will be detrimentally hit because of COVID-19 outbreak. Many people will lose their jobs and many enterprises will be out of business. It therefore is crucial that the national governments together with the European Commission design an appropriate set of measures to help revive the economy and support employment and prioritize these over other initiatives.
Steel sector is already having trouble with many manufacturing activities being put on hold or completely stopped. 
In such circumstances it is essential to ensure that steel consuming businesses maintain access to various sources of supply (both produced in the EU and imported ones), and, more importantly, that prices are not increased and competition remains active. This is also true for many other sectors where international trade is intensive.
Concluding, Carbon border adjustment mechanism as a mechanism oriented for better environment for next generations should not lead to development gaps between the EU and its neighbors. Climate change policy of the EU should in general be oriented on economic and environmental cohesion with neighboring states sharing policy goals with the EU.

C’est une certitude : le coût de la lutte contre le changement climatique va croître dans les prochaines années en France et en Europe.

However, this carbon price signal in itself will not be enough to make European industry reduce their emissions to the extent needed to meet the 2050 net neutrality goal. For that, large investments into new technologies are needed, and first movers into these technologies require certainty about carbon prices in order to build successful business cases. In some cases, they may also need additional public support to address the innovation market externalities. Carbon contracts for differences (CCFDs) with national governments or institutions can secure a fixed carbon strike price (e.g. 50-70 Euro/tCO2) over a given time period (e.g. 15-20 years) for individual projects and hence help to make these novel processes a competitive alternative. As such, they can act as hedging instruments against the uncertainty of future carbon prices, and also as a vehicle for additional support for low-carbon industrial technologies.

A consumption-based approach, which also maintains the free allocation of allowances, is well aligned with CCfDs, which ensure that the allowances received can be converted into income at a fixed rate and hence support the business case. Also, for the hedging costs of CCfD to be reasonable, a credible long-term carbon pricing scheme, such as the one provided by inclusion of consumption in the ETS, is essential.",,,withinfo,academic_research_instittution,large,closed,7587254,

Further information is provided in the attached EuLA position paper: 

Lime is a key enabling material, active in a number of important industrial sectors, such as steel, cement, non-ferrous metals, paper, glass, etc.  Ensuring the competitiveness of these lime consumers and the continuity of their operations in Europe is absolutely essential for our sector. That being said, the lime industry is a strong supporter of and invests continuously in carbon footprint reduction technologies; these investments and the viability of our industry should be protected.

•	Context 
The Paris Agreement is the cornerstone of an ambitious global program to address climate change mitigation. Avoiding carbon leakage is, in this context, essential from an environmental point of view: it ensures that companies financially contribute to the low-carbon transition without running the risk of being unfairly competed out. Against that background, the lime industry supports efficient mechanisms that protect EU major industrial sectors from unfair competition from outside of the EU (where competitors do not bear the cost of CO2). The following insights aim to support the efficiency of a future Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA).

•	Problem the initiative aims to tackle

A CBA should be introduced in a fair manner: as such, it is essential to identify the drivers of production displacement, and the CBA should be applied down at the product level.

It is equally essential to ensure that any CBA considers the global context of carbon leakage and production displacement.

To avoid any long-term effect on the structure of EU imports, the CBA mechanism should take into account the full GHG-related content of imported goods across value chain (from the creation to the importation of the product, including transport).

•	Likely economic impacts
EuLA supports the necessity to analyse the situation with regards to the overall value chain. Some sectors are crucial to be maintained in Europe because they create prosperity upwards and downwards. The IA should define these sectors and suggest specific protective measures, due to the key impact they have in the whole EU industry (steel might be a good example). 

The CBA shall also provide legal certainty, i.e. the carbon leakage list and the free allowances as a consequence, should remain intact for its intended duration.

•	Likely impacts on simplification and/or administrative burden

The IA must analyse in detail the different elements of the administrative system to protect against import and equally, not to penalise export.

International standards (e.g. ISO) should, when they exist, be applied to domestic and external production importing to Europe in order to evaluate the carbon footprint of a product and make them comparable.

•	Preserving the internal market
The CBA mechanism must avoid any distortion of competition or discrimination between domestic production of competing products in the EU market.

When evaluating the selection of different sectors that could be subject to the CBA, the IA should closely analyse this risk of distortion of competition. Lime, for example, is a strong competitor of some chemicals, with a relatively similar carbon footprint; if a CBA for lime reduces its level of free allowances, a distortion of competition in the EU domestic market will be generated without appropriate justification.",,780146710855-91,withinfo,business_association,micro,closed,7587254,
en,510080,FRA,KAYRROS,CARUNTU,PUBLISHED,2020-03-31 18:21:01,False,Ares(2020)1350037,,False,Anca,"Kayrros (https://www.kayrros.com/), a European company leading in Earth observation analytics, welcomes practical solutions with a global dimension to address the reduction of GHG emission, such as the setting of a carbon border adjustment mechanism. Such a mechanism should be crafted in a way that encourages large-scale long-term investments in a net-zero emissions economy.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism could effectively reduce GHG emissions if it is based upon a performance-based system for both imports and domestic energy products. This means tracking and aggregating data on emissions stemming from at least the production of oil and natural gas, gas associated with oil production and handling, gas transmission, distribution and consumption, but also from active and decommissioned coal mines.

The technologies and methodologies for determining the accurate footprint of the energy products imported into the European Union are already available. To a large extent, their readiness is due to the Union’s long-term vision in the area of space policy, which established the Copernicus Sentinel program for multi-spectral imaging instruments for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Access to satellite imagery, coupled with algorithmic processing and other types of data, enable the accurate measurement and reporting of GHG emissions along specific countries and value chains. This increased visibility can make it possible to differentiate among suppliers in the affected sectors (steel, cement, aluminum, etc.) according to their GHG intensity, measured in kg of CO2 equivalent per tonne. Moreover, under such a system, the carbon footprint of imports would be updated on a daily basis so that taxation at the border can adjust to changes in the production process outside the EU.
This approach has been recognized by the International Energy Agency (IEA), among other bodies. Their latest report on methane emissions (see https://bit.ly/39yx3ms) quotes several insights from Kayrros, including the identification of approximately 100 high volume-emitting events at any one time around the world. Together, in the course of one year, these events are releasing 20 megatons of methane which is equivalent to 1.8 gigatons of CO2 (based on a GWP of 20 years). Through its proprietary attribution model, Kayrros can identify that around one half of that amount, or 1 gigaton, are in regions with heavy industry such as oil & gas, coal mining, etc. This would be equivalent to the total annual CO2 emissions of Germany and France together. Moreover, the data shows significant variations in the GHG intensity of different producers, many of which are currently supplying the European market.

Methane emissions can therefore be detected and quantified at an asset level on a global scale, which represents a major step-change in the ability to work towards the reduction of man-made emissions. 

Similar measurements and analyses models can be applied for CO2 and NO2 emissions on a global scale. 

In this context, the establishment of a performance-based system for imports is a pragmatic and handy approach to reducing emissions.
In addition to the enforcement approach of a carbon border adjustment mechanism, the EU could also look at ways of testing and deploying measurement and quantification tools through international cooperation, with organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) or third countries. The goal would be to ensure that any other similar mechanisms are modelled upon the EU’s own performance-based system.

The CBA proposed by the Commission do not help to support the transformation of the industry towards achieving the EU climate goals. The risks and burdens that come with CBAs outweigh by far the opportunities. Moreover, the effectiveness of CBA is questionable.
A unilateral introduction of CBA bears the risk of the EU’s trading partners responding with tough countermeasures. This would mean major burdens on EU industry with its global value chains and, in particular, on the export-oriented chemical industry.
There is a range of options for CBA – from selective to comprehensive. In VCI’s view CBA have to meet certain criteria: They should be workable, easy to implement without much bureaucracy, effective, not impair the EU’s export interests, be compatible with the rules of the WTO and the Paris Agreement, and they must not cause burdens on industry or distort competition. It is highly unlikely that these criteria can be fulfilled at once. For this reason, CBA should not be introduced.
•From the most limited (climate tariffs for individual products) to the most comprehensive case (a CO2 border tax for all products with export refunding) there will be an immense need for information and a complex/bureaucratic design of the mechanism. The CO2 content of products has to be determined adequately, both inside the EU and for products imported into the EU. This involves much cost and work especially for the chemical industry. Globally agreed allocation rules for combined production would be needed. Sensitive information would need to be disclosed.
•A mechanism of climate tariffs for a small number of products would protect suppliers in these markets – while there would be strains on downstream sectors in the EU and on exports at all value stages. It follows from the above that only a comprehensive CBA mechanism with export refunds should be desirable for the EU which would be highly bureaucratic.
•Any limited CBA approach would inevitably result in distortions in competition to the detriment of the sectors not involved.
Also, it is questionable whether CBA can really bring about the pursued protection for CO2-intensive sectors. CBA are likely to have legal diversion effects (trade, allocation of renewable energy) of foreign competitors. Moreover, CBA are highly vulnerable to abuse, as there is no sound global certification system.
CBA must not replace existing instruments to prevent carbon leakage (free allocation, indirect cost compensation). These must be maintained and expanded even if CBA should be introduced – because only these instruments protect competitiveness for exporters.
The VCI is also highly sceptical that a WTO-compatible design of CBA can be achieved. Taking into account the provisions of the Paris Agreement would render the shaping of CBA even more complicated and reduces its effectiveness.
Instead of CBA, the EU should work on a global approach to climate protection (e.g. globally harmonised emission trading or other pricing systems for CO2) and give substantial support to the transformation of industry:
•Effective climate protection can be achieved only at global level. Therefore, the EU should intensify its efforts towards a global system. A first step could be a global introduction of a CO2 pricing system, starting at G20-level.
•Transformation of chemical industry cannot succeed behind protectionist fences but needs strong political impulses. This includes the availability of huge volumes of electricity from renewable sources at competitive prices (https://bit.ly/2WV8oGm) as well as more private and public funding for R&D and investment.
A comprehensive and thorough impact assessment is needed to find out how ambitious climate protection of the EU can be reconciled with a successful transformation of the chemical industry and the integration of the EU in the global economy. Alternative instruments to CBA need to be examined. ",,15423437054-40,withinfo,business_association,medium,closed,7587254,

Opinion on the
Carbon border adjustment mechanism – Commission initiative
I very much welcome the Commission’s initiative. As Chair of the Federal Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection (bvek) e.V. (German Emissions Trading Association) on behalf of the Federal Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection, I supported such meachnism at a meeting at the European Commission’s House in Berlin in 2008 (see http://www.bvek.de/symposium/symposium_2008-06.html ). In the meantime, the Bvek has repeatedly given detailed reasons and concrete expressions for this support: 
(2014: Http://www.bvek.de/symposium/beitraege/Hacker%20-%20bvek-Vorschlaege%201%20-%2027-06-14.pdf
2015: Http://www.bvek.de/downloads/S2015_bvek-aktuelle-Probleme_10-06-15.pdf
2016: Http://www.bvek.de/symposium/beitraege/7-Hacker-ETS-nach-2020.pdf )

I have also made available to some German MEPs in 2016 a detailed amendment to the EU Directive, as set out in the annex. 
In the recitals, I pointed out that the existing rules to avoid the risk of carbon leakage (CL) by generous allocation of free emission allowances to sectors/sub-sectors at risk of that risk have eliminated, but at the same time generated significant windfall profits. The Bvek proposal ensures, in full compliance with WTO rules, a level playing field both within and outside the EU while eliminating the risk of windfall profits.

All EU emission allowances should in principle be auctioned in the future, but in order to avoid CL risk, all importers of products in sectors/sub-sectors where there is a relevant CL risk should also be required to purchase EU allowances and surrender them to the competent authorities according to their actual import volumes multiplied by average benchmarks for the relevant products. At the same time, all exporters of the same product categories should be allocated allowances free of charge according to their actual export volumes multiplied by the same benchmarks. As the benchmarks for importers and exporters are identical, all relevant WTO rules are respected, in particular non-discrimination between foreign and domestic producers.

Please refer to the Annex for all further explanations and details of the proposal for a regulation. Although the proposal in the Annex refers to the EU Directive as at 2016 for the article numbers, it can be easily adapted to the current EU Directive.

Unlike the levying of a border tax, the obligation to surrender EU emission allowances ensures that, for each emission allowance price over time, the burden between ‘nationals of the EU’ and ‘non-nationals of the EU’ is automatically fair. By contrast, this can never be achieved with a tax, whatever the specific rate is fixed.

Finally, it should be noted that the intended change to the EU rules under the Green Deal should also address the two other main weaknesses of the EU ETS and the EU’s climate change policy. Indeed, there should be a gradual extension of the EU ETS to all EU greenhouse gas emissions, starting with transport emissions in the short term, and a reform of the use of the proceeds from the auctioning of EU emissions allowances (distribution per capita to EU citizens).

Ich begrüße die Initiative der EU-Kommission sehr. Ich habe als Vorsitzender des Bundesverbandes Emissionshandel und Klimaschutz (bvek) e.V. (German Emissions Trading Association) im Namen des bvek bereits 2008 einen solchen Meachnismus auf einer Tagung im Europäischen Haus der EU-Kommission in Berlin befürwortet (siehe hierzu http://www.bvek.de/symposium/symposium_2008-06.html ). Der bvek hat diese Befürwortung zwischenzeitlich mehrmals wiederholt, ausführlich begründet und konkretisiert:

Ich habe ferner 2016 einigen deutschen MdEPs einen als Anlage beigefügten detailliert ausformulierten Änderungsantrag der EU-Richtlinie zur Verfügung gestellt. 
In den Erwägungsgründen habe ich darauf hingewiesen, dass die bisherigen Regelungen zur Vermeidung des Carbon-Leakage-(CL)-Risikos durch großzügige Vergabe von kostenlosen Emissionsrechten an von diesem Risiko bedrohten Sektoren/Teilsektoren zwar beseitigt haben, zugleich aber in erheblichen Ausmaß Windfall Profits generiert haben. Durch den bvek-Vorschlag werden in völliger Übereinstimmung mit den WTO-Regeln einerseits die Wettbewerbsgleichheit sowohl innerhalb als auch außerhalb der EU sichergestellt und zugleich das Risiko von Windfall Profits beseitigt.

Alle EU-Emissionsberechtigungen sollten zukünftig grundsätzlich versteigert werden, aber zur Vermeidung des CL-Risikos sollten alle Importeure von Produkten der Sektoren/Teilsektoren, bei denen ein relevantes CL-Risiko besteht, verpflichtet werden, ebenfalls EU-Emissionsberechtigungen zu erwerben und entsprechend ihren tatsächlichen Importmengen multipliziert mit Durchschnitts-Benchmarks der jeweiligen Produkte bei den zuständigen Behörden abzugeben. Gleichzeitig sollten alle Exporteure derselben Produktkategorien entsprechend ihren tatsächlichen Exportmengen multipliziert mit denselben Benchmarks kostenlos Emissionsberechtigungen zugeteilt erhalten. Da die Benchmarks für Importeure und Exporteure identisch sind, werden alle relevanten WTO-Regeln insbesondere die Nicht-Diskriminierung von ausländischen gegenüber inländischen Produzenten eingehalten.

Hinsichtlich aller weiteren Erläuterungen und Details des Regelungsvorschlages wird auf die Anlage verwiesen. Der Vorschlag in der Anlage bezieht sich zwar hinsichtlich der Artikel-Nummern auf die EU-Richtlinie mit Stand 2016, lässt sich aber ohne große Probleme auf die aktuell gültige EU-Richtlinie anpassen.

Durch die Abgabepflicht von EU-Emissionsberechtigungen wird anders als bei der Erhebung einer Grenzabgabe-Steuer sichergestellt, dass bei jedem sich im Laufe der Zeit ergeben Preis der Emissionsberechtigungen die Belastungen zwischen „EU-Inländern“ und „EU-Ausländern“ automatisch fair gestaltet sind. Im Gegensatz dazu kann dies mit einer Steuer, wie auch immer der Steuersatz konkret festgelegt wird, niemals erreicht werden.

Abschließend sei darauf hingewiesen, dass bei der beabsichtigten Änderung der EU-Regelungen im Rahmen des Green Deals auch die zwei weiteren wesentlichen Schwachpunkte des EU-ETS bzw. der EU-Klimaschutzpolitik beseitigt werden sollten. Es sollte nämlich schrittweise die Erweiterung des EU-ETS auf alle Treibhausgas-Emissionen der EU erfolgen, kurzfristig angefangen mit den Verkehrsemissionen, und eine Reform der Verwendung der Erlöse aus der Versteigerung der EU-Emissionsberechtigungen (Ausschüttung pro Kopf auf die EU-Bürger) erfolgen.

And I proposed in this report the introduction of a carbon adjustment mechanism, the report had been supported by a large majority in 2015. 
The idea is to establish a fair system between all industrial competitors. Europe cannot impose a right to pollute only on the companies present in its territory (even if I agree with the polluter pays principle) and close the eyes on all imports which are not subject to any carbon constraints. The risk is to relocate industries and jobs and import pollution. With this system of carbon border adjustment, Europe sends a virtuous message to all industrial players (European and non-European), ‘less polluting and fewer you will have to buy CO2 allowances’, it is good for your competitiveness, good for jobs and, above all, good for the planet and biodiversity. 
Europe could initiate this mechanism to products that are subject to the ETS, and then in the course of progress, extending it to other manufactured products. We see that carbon costs are an important factor in global competitiveness, Europe cannot do as if competition were only within Europe. I would point out, in contrast to all those who say the opposite, that there is nothing more simply to trace the seedlings produced (base metals for example), that is an obligation in the manufacturing process and required by customers. The latter wish to know the whole process from the beginning to the end of the manufacturing process (technical data sheet necessary to trace the product’s life in the event of a quality problem, for example). It would therefore be sufficient to use a supplementary line in the technical data sheet to provide information on the CO2 emissions of that product.",False,Edouard,"J'adhère totalement au mécanisme d'ajustement carbone aux frontières de l'Europe car ayant été moi-même député européen (2014/2019) j'ai rédigé et fais voter un rapport sur les conditions de compétitivité dans la production des métaux de base. Et j'avais proposé dans ce rapport l'instauration d'un mécanisme d'ajustement carbone, le rapport avait été soutenu à une large majorité en 2015. 
L' idée étant la mise en place d'un système équitable entre tous les compétiteurs industriels.

L' Europe pourrait initier ce mécanisme aux produits soumis à ETS et ensuite au fil des avancées l'étendre à d'autres produits manufacturés. Nous voyons bien que le coût carbone est un facteur important dans la compétitivité mondiale, l'Europe ne peut faire comme si la concurrence n'était qu'intra européenne. Je rappelle, contrairement à tous ceux qui disent le contraire, qu'il n'y a rien de plus simple que de tracer les semis produits (métaux de base par exemple), c'est une obligation dans le process de fabrication et exigée par les clients. Ces derniers veulent connaitre tout le processus du début à la fin de la fabrication (fiche technique nécessaire à remonter la vie du produit en cas de problème de qualité par exemple).

With regards to the main objective, we support the Commission's endeavour in instituting a carbon border adjustment measure to ""[fight] climate change by avoiding carbon leakage"". As the fight against climate change needs to be global, the measure can be an opportunity for the EU to project its climate leadership globally. When designing the measure, it is therefore important to consider the impacts of the measure on both these EU internal targets (greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy production), and global CO2 reduction ambitions, and ""to prevent environmental harm"" as stated in the inception report.

Regardless of the policy instruments suggested by the Commission in the report (i.e. a carbon tax on selected products – both on imported and domestic products; a new carbon customs duty or tax on imports; the extension of the EU ETS to imports), what is paramount is that the measure should enable a level playing field in which the 'polluter pays' – a cornerstone of EU environmental policy enshrined in Art 191 TFEU.

The scope of the measure needs to include the full steel value chain, from finished products to upstream raw materials. Both direct and indirect CO2 emissions also need to be included to prevent further carbon leakage, even when the indirect segment is not yet subject to EU ETS. 

According to the UN's 2019 Global Resources Outlook, resource extraction and processing account for half of the world's carbon emissions, failing to include the entire value chain would lead to a potential increase in imports of carbon-intensive non-taxed products like coke, pig iron, directly reduced iron (DRI) or other products, and could increase rather than reduce carbon leakage. Choosing to cover one part of the value chain but not others would also disrupt the level playing field within the EU industry.

Adherent to the 'polluter pays' principle, it is critical that 'cleaner' third-country producers importing steel into the EU should be taxed less, and / or third-country producers with a CO2 footprint lower than the EU benchmark (however it is calculated) should be exempted. For example, a third-country integrated steel producer performing better than an average EU integrated producer should be taxed less or exempted when they import into the EU. 
The 'polluter pays' principle could also be used to adjust the mechanism to incentivise producers whose CO2 footprint is better than that of the average EU producer, setting a clear stimulus for decarbonisation. This setup would not only contribute to negative carbon leakage (reducing emissions elsewhere.
Without an individual adjustment, a 'one-size-fits-all' mechanism applied to third-country producers exporting to the EU, would be discriminatory towards 'cleaner' third-country producers.

We clearly see the benefits of the current Emissions Trading System, including the strong policy commitment, the effective price formation on the markets as a function of supply and demand, and the increasing certainty that emissions will fall below a predetermined emissions target because of the emission cap decline. In addition, the EU ETS has contributed to a significant increase in awareness about the environmental cost of carbon emissions.

However, we feel, in line with the Inception Impact Assessment, that a few improvements could be considered. 
A further extension of the scope of the EU would significantly improve the effectiveness of the system. Starting with energy-intensive industries (e.g. steel, cement, chemicals etc.) for piloting purposes and then applying it to all other sectors will be key for prudent expansion of the EU ETS.  We estimate that, given a balanced allocation of new carbon rights, this could boost price formation and the impact on the real economy. 
Carbon leakage could, consistently with the direction of thinking of the European Commission, be a threat to the European ambitions regarding climate change and could unintentionally hamper EU production. A carbon border adjustment mechanism, with the appropriate design, could solve this problem. AACB feels that a new carbon customs duty, complementary to the EU ETS would be the most sensible approach. However, we would like to stress that it is of utmost importance that the methodology of such an import duty is designed carefully, technically feasible, and does not unnecessarily hamper EU economic performance. 

Few considerations/improvements that are important to note: 

1 The volatile price of EU ETS, especially in the early days, has limited the effectiveness of EU ETS in reducing the CO2 emissions in Europe as it could not provide full investment certainty. This price volatility has been driven by not only the policy reforms, but also fuel prices, Europe-wide heatwaves, the trading strategies of large generators, and the active management of EUAs by small industry players. For example, with this price volatility, a price floor, both on the EU ETS and the new carbon duty, can provide investment certainty although it does not necessarily result in further emission savings. 

2 National policies of member states also contributed to the price evolution of EUAs and its effectiveness. Tightening the ETS cap has proven to be effective in helping phase out some of the fossil fuels but national policy is important to complement EU ETS to incentivise low carbon build-out. A successful expansion of the scope of the EU ETS is conditional on a balanced allocation of new carbon rights.

3 Auctioning versus free allocation is another important feature of the EU ETS market mechanism. Sectors’ benchmarks calculation can allow a comparative analysis between different importers and as such a fair allocation of emission credits while limiting any surplus accumulation or pass through behavior. In addition, a continuous update of the system of free allocation to focus on sectors at highest risk of carbon leakage will be crucial. 

4 Having an infrastructure to monitor, report and verify emissions from different parts of the supply chain is crucial for proper allocation of credits and penalization in case of non-compliance. 

The European Commission is taking a major step to design a working Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to create a level playing field for all producers by exposing them to similar emission reduction requirements. However, it remains crucial that the EU takes into account the risk of carbon leakage, the vulnerability and data reliability of some developing countries, the EU ETS price volatility and investment certainty, the allocation of emission credits, etc.",,368029129221-78,withinfo,company,large,closed,7587254,

Since 2019, AFEP has been strongly advocating for the EU to take concrete actions to tackle carbon leakage and related competitiveness gaps at the expense of EU-based industries. Exploratory work on a carbon border adjustment mechanism within the “Green Deal” and the EU industrial policy strategy is a positive signal towards the making of operational instruments at EU level. It is key to address this critical issue if the EU wants to maintain a strong industrial basis while providing further incentives to the non-EU industry to catch up with EU ambitious targets at the core of the Green Deal. AFEP recommends that the IAA on the intended BCA should :
(a) Investigate whether the design of a border carbon adjustment mechanism could reconcile the objective of the EU further contributing to the worldwide carbon emission reduction with a cut of EU emissions by 50 %/55 % in 2030 compared to 1990 and climate neutrality by 2050 and the resorption of competitiveness gaps impacting the EU industry. This should lead to verify if, in case it is limited to specific sectors, a border carbon could avoid cross-sectoral distortions, especially downstream the supply chain. The analysis of costs impacting competitiveness should also take into account the issue of indirect emissions related to imported products and examine whether a border carbon adjustment can be combined with ETS scheme and pre-existing tools to address carbon leakage with free allowances and compensation for indirect carbon emissions. 
(b) Examine whether this mechanism can be assumed to be compliant with WTO requirements for unilateral measures imposed on imported products and other obligations deriving from international law, including the Paris Agreement. This legal review should come along with anticipative scenarios on possible retaliatory measures by major trading partners, even outside the WTO dispute settlement framework, so that the IIA can deliver a full picture on the climatic and economic impact of such an instrument.
(c) Take into account the significant economic turmoil resulting from the Covid 19 sanitary crisis/ oil market fluctuations and its impact on carbon pricing regulatory framework, and especially on the functioning of the ETS market. the IIA should factor in current disturbances that are likely to modify in depth the economic and carbon emission landscape in which the BCA proposal has been initiated. It is worth considering whether the BCA or any other tax-based instrument would act in this context (contribute to fuel the recession to come or on the opposite shelter the EU industry from further carbon-based dumping practices by third countries).
(d) Conduct, as envisaged in the IIA notice, an initial comparative analysis of alternative and/or complementary instruments that could help achieving the double objective of EU achieve its Green Deal emission reduction targets and of improved competitiveness for the EU industry. 
 the IIA review should include an array of relevant instruments such as domestic measures, but also tools mutually agreed in bilateral or plurilateral agreements and paves the way for a science-based analysis. This would ensure that the future complete impact assessment result in an objective comparison between policy options, with a systemic cost/benefit balance for each of them in terms of climate and economic impacts. Such comparative assessment is even more needed in the event alternative tools would better perform in the current economic turmoil.

1) The Commission should follow up on its recent commitment to strengthen existing carbon leakage instruments (free allocation and indirect cost compensation). As a minimum, current level of support must be guaranteed for the upcoming EU ETS phase 2021-2030. These measures have been recognized by the Commission to be effective in sustaining industrial competitiveness and they are compatible with international frameworks.

2) Existing carbon leakage instruments should be complemented with a European industrial electricity price, alleviating the energy cost pressure. Such a model could be based on Contracts for Difference (CfD) and implemented on a national level under the approval of EU state aid guidelines. If designed in combination with Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) for renewable electricity, an industrial electricity price could effectively contribute to decarbonizing energy-intensive industries and enable a market-based integration of solar and wind energy.

3) Due to uncertainty of legal and technical feasibility as well as practical difficulties of implementation, carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanisms are not effective in replacing the existing instruments of carbon leakage protection in place under the ETS. It is thus of major importance that prior to any decision, the Commission conducts thorough impact assessments to substantiate its claims and provide sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of such measures.

European Plastics Converters (EuPC) is the leading EU-level trade association, based in Brussels, representing European plastics converting companies. Plastics converters use plastics raw materials and recycled polymers to manufacture new products, which are purchased preferably in Europe or outside the Single Market. 
EuPC totals about 45 national as well as European plastics converting industry associations and represents more than 50,000 companies, producing over 50 million tons of plastic products every year. The European plastics industry makes a significant contribution to the welfare in Europe by enabling innovation, creating quality of life to citizens and facilitating resource efficiency and climate protection. More than 1.6 million people are working in EU converting companies (mainly SMEs) to create a turnover in excess of € 260 billion per year. 
Since its creation, EuPC has always been a great supporter of the EU initiatives for the industry and for the protection of the environment, those that reflect a true European vision. 

REASONING 

European Plastics Converters welcome the initiative of the European Commission to ensure a level playing field between European and non-European companies. Europe’s efforts to go climate-neutral by 2050 cannot be undermined by lack of ambition by other companies and countries around the world, especially looking at the International agreements we are bound and the need to truly protect our Environment. 
Hence, a new carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism that can impose direct and indirect carbon cost to importers similar to the cost already charged to European manufacturers would restore a level playing field on the European market. This will in turn create an incentive for importers to adopt climate policies in their own countries and allow the carbon content of products to be better reflected for the final customer, providing a more efficient and powerful signal for consumption and behavioural changes.
For the European plastics industry, this is particularly relevant because the high quality of production, safety requirements (for workers, for the environment, for users…) and sophistication of production render it quite costly, especially when compared with competitors based in neighbouring or Asian countries. Reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement will involve further investment and performance improvement that would make plastic manufacturing increasingly expensive in Europe. If this virtuosity is thwarted by imported raw materials and finished products with no carbon emissions’ compensation mechanism, this will nullify by default all European efforts. 
As said, the need to apply a level playing field and use a CBA, as proposed by the European Commission, is necessary for both raw materials as well as semi-finished and finished products. Otherwise, we wonder how a European company can compete in the global arena without having a legal protection from unfair and polluting counterparties.
 
FINAL COMMENT 

In the light of the above exposed arguments, EuPC believes that a CBA mechanism must be applied to ensure there is no carbon leakage and to integrate the existing trade defence tools the EU has in place. Europe is ambitious in its green activities and, thanks to the Climate Deal and related Communications, is setting a higher benchmark for all European and non-European industries.

FEVE Contribution on the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.
31th of March 2020

FEVE , The European Container Glass Federation, welcomes the possibility to provide feedback on the Inception Impact Assessment on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
In the absence of equivalent measures taken by other regions of the world regarding carbon pricing, CBAM is one of the possible options (together with free allocation, consumption charges,…) to protect EU industries against the risk of carbon leakage. 
 In this respect, CBAM deserves to be carefully examined.
FEVE does not have yet a clear position on CBAM mainly because a lot remained to be defined. But we want to raise the following concerns:

1.	It is essential to design any CBAM to be WTO compatible and to discuss with our trade partners to avoid any retaliation measures (which could affect products not covered by the CBAM).
2.	It is also crucial to give industry a medium/long term vision. The ETS revision had the merit to give industry some certainty until 2030 (carbon leakage list, level of free allocation,…). The system should not be changed in a few years’ time to propose a completely different mechanisms. This 10 years visibility period is important to maintain the current levels of investment and to attract new ones.
3.	Each sector is different and any impact assessment should be carried out at an appropriate NACE or even PRODCOM level, in agreement with the different sectors. CBAM should not be the only option to be assessed as consumption charges might work better for some sectors.
4.	CBAM will only protect EU companies selling their products in the EU. Net exporters will face a major disadvantage and should be compensated.
5.	The possible impacts on the whole value chain of a sector should be analysed. If a CBAM is only designed for basic materials, it could become less expensive to buy a complex product directly from outside the EU rather than producing it in the EU from the basic materials.
6.	A transition period will be necessary where CBAM and free allocation still co-exist in order to allow the sectors to adapt.
7.	The carbon intensity benchmarks defining the level of the CBAM should be set at a high level to encourage non-EU companies to provide their own carbon footprint data. Monitoring and verification of these data will be crucial provide trust and to allow the CBAM to work adequately.
8.	The funds raised with the CBAM should be reinjected in the EU economy, with a priority for low CO2 projects in industry.

Amino acids are the main building block for proteins. Using amino acids in livestock production enables to meet the animals’ nutritional requirements more accurately, saving therefore land used for production of resources, and reducing nitrogen pollution on livestock farms such as nitrates and ammonia. It also enables to use less protein-rich feed ingredients such as soybean meal in feed diets, which contributes to reduce pressure on deforestation. Amino acids are essential ingredients for livestock farming. From a strategic perspective, it is therefore important to develop the EU amino acid production and reduce dependency from imports.

AANE welcomes the reflection engaged by the European Commission on the carbon border adjustment mechanism. To be effective in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and avoid carbon leakages, it is important to measure the carbon footprint of a product throughout its life cycle, instead of limiting the scope to emissions taking place on the EU territory.

The amino acids market is growing, at global and EU level. Despite this positive trend, the production of amino acids in the EU is today in danger, mainly because of the fierce competition imposed by Chinese producers. With a strategic objective to reduce its dependency from US soybeans, China has drastically increased its amino acids production capacity over the past recent years and is today the main amino acid supplier of the EU. The competition does not take place on a level playing field, considering for example the social and environmental production standards. The carbon border adjustment mechanism offers an opportunity to valorise EU production. 

The production of amino acids by fermentation is indeed an energy-intensive process, however enabling eventually the reduction of the environmental footprint of animal products. The carbon footprint of amino acids production is primarily determined by the following parameters: source of carbohydrates, source of energy, source of ammonia and plant efficiency through fermentation yield. AANE has performed the peer-reviewed life cycle assessment of its amino acids portfolio, following the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology developed by the European Commission. Taking the example of lysine, which is the main amino acids in terms of volume, results show that the carbon footprint of lysine produced in the EU is around 4,5 times lower than the carbon footprint of lysine produced in China, whereas China is the main lysine supplier of the EU with increasing market share. 

Including feed-grade amino acids production by fermentation in the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism is a powerful opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to strengthen the EU amino acid industry at the same time. 

It is however sensible to be cautious in the implementation of this new mechanism by ensuring consistency with existing mechanisms such as free allocation of emission allowances and compensation for indirect carbon costs.

Given the fact that the EU only accounts for 10% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential for the EU to complement its already ambitious climate targets with measures that create a global level-playing field for its companies, especially when they are interacting with Europe’s main trading partners. 

Designing a CBA mechanism will be politically challenging. The process needs to be systematic, well-thought through, and possible consequences need to be assessed, analysed and if deemed negative, mitigated thoroughly. It is pivotal to incorporate the following guiding principles into a possible CBA mechanism’s design:

1. A possible CBA mechanism must not substitute current carbon leakage measures! Such an approach is highly problematic and could jeopardise the tool’s legality as well as its effectiveness.

2. A possible CBA mechanism must be in accordance with World Trade Organisation rules and other international obligations of the EU (e.g. United Nations). 

3. The EU’s supply with critical raw materials and semi-finished products must be guaranteed.


Questions raised in the EC’s Inception Impact Assessment:

Q1 EC Inception Impact Assessment: Type of policy instrument: A potential CBA mechanism should be built on an extended import-ETS model.

Q2 EC Inception Impact Assessment: Methodological approach: A CBA mechanism should be based on EU ETS benchmark values for industrial processes, unless the importer certifies lower carbon content or higher CO2-related costs at origin.

Q3 EC Inception Impact Assessment: Sectoral scope: A potential CBA mechanism should only be started with selected (sub-)sectors to address uncertainty and explore possible legal challenges or retaliatory measures.

Reaching this target is likely to involve a significant increase in carbon prices. To avoid a loss of competitiveness for EU industries and higher CO2 emissions in other regions, we support the principle of protecting efficient european industries exposed to unfair international competition through a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
If we are fully convinced by the final objective of being carbon neutral in 2050, achieving this objective does not seem however in good way without stepping-up ambitions and support of the European Commission on all low carbon solutions. An energy mix based on all low carbon energies must be supported or at least not hampered when they already contribute to CO2 emissions reduction so that energy policy and climate action can go hand in hand. 
The level of the carbon price signal at European level must therefore be ambitious enough to achieve the objectives of reducing CO2 emissions at lower cost. Thus we support reinforcement and extension of ETS system and carbon taxation insofar as it is socially just, that’s to say accompanied by redistribution measures. The revenues from ETS and from energy taxation should mainly be channeled to help people and workers most impacted in the energy transition. It should  be clarified how the costs of the transformation will be shared across society and throughout the industrial value.
We deeply promote a just transition to protect jobs, competitiveness, industry and investments in Europe by avoiding carbon leaks. A fair global level playing field must be guaranteed by avoiding carbon leakage and by precluding carbon dumping. All regions of the world should carry their fair share in the additional costs of the transition.  As Europe represents only 10 % of global emissions, it is key that other parts of the world develop the same level of ambition and carry their fair share in the global effort to combat emissions.
The CBAM must be set-up to ensure a fair competition from foreign industries. These measures will also incentivize investments in low carbon policies in other countries as well in the the EEA countries and favor innovation everywhere. We are of course aware of risks and legal issues regarding trade agreements, WTO regulations and possible retaliation actions and we think that this must be fully integrated to define the best mechanism that will protect our industry and jobs. This objective can be reached by addressing carbon pricing differences in free trade agreements, by closing the borders for products produced without respecting international environmental agreements or labour standards. New financial products (e.g. green as well carbon-free bonds) that promote long-term sustainable investments can also be developed while short-termism on the financial markets should be discouraged. 
European industries need fair access to international markets as well as to benefit from a real european industrial strategy. While promoting common values in Europe we must do the same internationally. When negotiating and signing trade agreements, the EU must impose compliance from the partners with Fundamental Labour Standards as well as with the Paris agreement to mitigate Climate change. Trade agreements should contain an enforceable chapter on labour rights. They should also contain an enforceable chapter about fighting climate change within the framework of the Paris 2015th agreement to ensure a level playing field safeguarding our energy intensive industries.
In conclusion, massive investments will be needed in the industry sector to undertake appropriate restructuring of value chains and decarbonize their processes. EU should  focus on implementing a large panel of measures to trigger the development of a competitive low carbon industry in Europe. Support for research and innovation will be crucial in establishing a true EU leadership and a climate-driven industrial policy.

The Italian Association of Energy Economists considers essential this consultation and attaches it high importance. The EU, a world leader in the decarbonisation path, should create level playing field for European companies by defining a new structural industrial policy that can compensate for industry in terms of energy and environmental costs including circular economy.

When achieving our climate goals and to realise the ambition to reach climate neutrality by 2050, it is vital that all Member States take the necessary responsibility and actions in reducing their carbon emissions. 

For CEEP, the principle of a carbon border adjustment between EU and its partners is seductive as a climate tool promoting decarbonised products inside Europe and avoiding carbon leakage of industries out of Europe preventing competition with imported products that would be less expensive but heavily carbonised. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of such a tool implies a long path of difficulties: Which industrial sectors? How to define the carbon content of products at the border? Which compliance with the WTO rules? How would react EU trading partners? How to ensure a coherency between a carbon border adjustment mechanism and the EU-ETS, keeping in mind that this example is a fragile construction as the sudden decrease of its price during the present corona virus crisis shows it.  

CBA is a solution to explore especially for simple products, yet CEEP would like to recall that if the idea is to create a European decarbonised industry, the CBA could be combined with other solutions to build a decarbonised internal market in which the industry would find buyers for their products. CEEP invites the Commission to propose and explore these solutions as they have been developed in the recent Agora Energiewende report “Climate-Neutral Industry ». 

Finally, CEEP underlines that decarbonisation will require huge investments in many industrial sectors.

The EU Bicycle, Pedal-Assist E-Bike and Bike Components Industry is a major contributor to the EU’s decarbonization goals and forms one of the EU’s Green Industries.

In light of these observations, EBMA would like to welcome the EU Commission’s initiative to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism which will ensure that the price of imports reflect more accurately their carbon content in order to accomplish the EU’s green goals and ensure a level-playing field.

Indeed, the Bicycle, Pedal-Assist E-Bike and Bike Components Industry is a very good example of a sustainable EU industry developed locally by SMEs: realistically, the only possible way to seriously cut CO2 and Sulphur dioxide emissions, and create long-term green jobs, is to help and defend the development of EU manufacturing SMEs.

One bicycle or pedal assist e-bike made in the EU generates 61kg to 123kg less CO2 and lethal emissions such as sulphur dioxide than one imported from China. The import of 20 million bicycles and e-bikes, which is the annual EU demand, from China would result in over 2 Million tons of extra emissions globally.

As proven in the study of the Milan Politecnic, these additional emissions would result from:
•	50% by the difference in the manufacturing carbon footprint in China which still relies heavily on coal (for instance, aluminium production in China relies on coal up to 80%, while EU
aluminium production uses only 5% coal).
•	the other 50% because of transport emissions: containerships still use heavily polluting sludge oil which causes lethal emissions of sulphur dioxide, and over 60% of containers go back to China empty because of the trade imbalance between the EU and China.

Moreover, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the shift to renewable energy is a major goal for the EU, as stated in guidelines such as the “European Green Deal” (European Commission, 2019), the “2020 climate and energy package” (European Commission, 2008), the “Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050” (European Commission, 2011) and the “2030 framework for climate and energy policies” (European Commission, 2014).

China is by far the biggest polluter in the world and will continue using more and more coal-based energy until 2050 thanks to its unjust status as a developing country (rather than industrialized country) confirmed in the Paris Agreement COP 21. You can also see the pollution radar here: https://earth.nullschool.net/cs/#current/chem/surface/level/overlay=cosc/orthographic=120.92,24.23,450/loc=114.120,24.762

Further, regarding circular economy, the EU bicycle, e-bike and components industry has already started investments now with the EU aluminium industry to adapt secondary alloys for cycle components in the near future. This would improve further and significantly the carbon footprint of EU-manufactured bicycles, e-bikes and components.

It would range from EUR 100 to EUR 150 on the price of a vehicle at a CO2 price of EUR 30 per tonne.

It must incorporate the emissions directly from the production of the energy and raw materials needed to produce them: Iron ore for steel, bauxite for aluminium, petroleum for refined petrol This is a requirement for the battery industry for electric vehicles than France and Germany are in the process of building. Encouraging virtuous forms of production in the countries supplying primary raw materials reinforces the rationale of the approach, while at the same time encouraging the product to be traced back to the product location throughout the sector, it was not possible to stop them taking into account direct emissions from the manufacture of the products.

The European cement industry already faces a strong risk of carbon leakage despite the partial free allocation provided under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). This risk is increasing at a very fast pace, as third countries which are not subject to the same  constraints build up their export capacity to the EU.

If designed properly, a carbon border mechanism could create the level playing field the industry needs to deliver low-carbon investments and move towards carbon neutrality along the value chain. It could also incentivise third countries to step up their efforts on climate change and ensure that the EU does not “outsource” its CO2 emissions through the import of more CO2-intensive products. Considering the EU’s renewed carbon ambitions, we therefore see the timely development of adequately designed carbon border mechanism as central to the European Green Deal. 

It is imperative that any carbon border mechanism co-exists with free allocation under the EU ETS, at least until the end of Phase IV. The replacement of the existing carbon leakage measures by an untested mechanism would create considerable uncertainty and risks for investments in the EU, at a time the industry needs a predictable framework to deliver low-carbon investments. 

The core objective of a carbon border mechanism should be that an importer to the EU market faces the same CO2 costs as an EU domestic producer. OFICMEN suggests some design principles which (1) are fair and transparent for both EU and non-EU producers, (2) will have a positive impact on climate worldwide, and (3) will avoid carbon leakage and imported CO2 emissions.

In conclusion, the European cement industry faces a risk of carbon leakage that is already underway, despite the partial free allocation of allowances under the ETS.  In the absence of a level playing field, it is likely that the EU industry will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in increased market shares of less CO2-efficient cements and risks of factory closures, with consequent social implications, across the EU. This competitive disadvantage will further increase as the EU implements ambitious CO2 reduction policies as part of the European Green Deal, unless similarly ambitious policies are set up by third countries. It is therefore critical and urgent that a carbon border mechanism is put in place.

Eucolait agrees with the overarching goals of the Green Deal and supports the shift towards increasingly sustainable food systems, while at the same time meeting the growing demand for food. It is clear that trade policy has an important role to play in this regard.

Producers in the EU are faced with growing demands and requirements with regard to environmental and climate performance. While avoiding carbon leakage caused by imports of products which are more carbon intensive than their EU equivalents might be helpful in ensuring high ambitions in carbon reductions and a level playing field, efforts must be made to ensure that any action taken is fully in line with WTO rules and other agreements concluded by the EU. Regardless of the form that the carbon border adjustment mechanism would take, designing a WTO-proof instrument will be tricky because this is basically uncharted territory in international trade law. This type of measures have not to date been put in place by any country, let alone tested in the WTO system. In this context, it will be necessary to make sure that the administrative burden the scheme would create is not such that it will in practice deter imports.  

It will be equally crucial to thoroughly consult all trading partners and representatives of the affected sectors throughout the legislative process. Even a carefully designed and well intended mechanism could unintentionally become a significant barrier to trade and/or discriminate against certain operators. We seek to avoid that any new policy instrument will be interpreted as a discriminatory and protectionist measure by third country trading partners. We have seen on multiple occasions, for instance in the EU-US aircraft dispute, whereby measures deemed protectionist and trade distorting in non-agricultural sectors had a knock-on effect on agricultural goods. Retaliatory tariffs, import bans or other trade restrictive measures are the last thing the EU dairy sector, which has suffered a huge number of demand shocks lately, needs. Care needs to be taken that milk production is not shifted from Europe to other regions where it is less efficient and has a higher carbon foot print. This is exactly what will happen if European dairy exports are hit with additional barriers. Eucolait calls on the Commission to take a sensible and measured approach, which does not restrict imports or create trade tensions.

Moreover, with respect to any possibility that carbon border adjustment could be extended directly to imports of agricultural products, given the very marginal imports of dairy products imported into the EU annually (and mainly from Switzerland) we feel it would be appropriate to exclude dairy from this discussion.

Finally, in light of the corona pandemic which is currently raging, we feel it would be appropriate to postpone the discussion on this and other initiatives under the Green Deal and to focus all efforts on tackling the short and long term consequences caused by the virus.

The introduction of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs) requires very serious consideration of their costs and benefits. They are politically very risky, complicated and costly to implement and should be considered only in the most extreme cases where other options for finding a common solution have been exhausted. The primary tools against a risk of carbon leakage are current measures in EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), like free allocation and indirect compensation, and they should be in place also in future. 

Finnish businesses support the climate neutrality target of 2050 for the EU, and we see, that the EU ETS is an effective tool to reduce GHG emissions in energy production and industry and it must remain as a main instrument to these sectors. Carbon pricing continues to grow globally as a cost-efficient tool for emissions reductions. Currently around 20 % of global emissions are under a carbon price mechanism. But when comparing the measures among industry in different countries, progress is very slow among Europe’s main trading partners. The EU must ensure the global competitiveness of European companies and a level playing field in key export markets. It is good, that Commission studies different options to minimize a risk of carbon leakage, which is due to uneven level of climate ambitious in Europe and globally. In the same time, the present and mostly well-functioning measures like free allocation and indirect compensation in the EU ETS need to be continued in a sufficient way as long as there are no equal carbon pricing schemes among major trading partners outside Europe. The uncertainty about the level of these ETS carbon leakage measures in future is poison to investment decisions among ETS companies. As said above, Finnish businesses are favour of a proper impact assessment of CBAMs, so we all can learn more on these measures, as they are not in use in large scale anywhere. A detailed analysis should be made of the practical feasibility, legal aspects, impacts on the sectors involved as well downstream sectors, and risks of retaliation. The functionality and compatibility with EU ETS need to be study carefully to avoid any distraction, especially in the options, where ETS allowances would be used as a CBAM for import goods.

Designing of a CBAM will be politically challenging and subject to many uncertainties. It is extremely difficult to determine the carbon footprint of different products and charging additional tariffs or taxes will also entail additional costs that could hamper the competitiveness of the EU export industry. What is more, the carbon border adjustment would not benefit EU companies when operating in third markets. The unilateral introduction of a new CBAM tool would most likely lead to retaliatory measures especially from EU’s biggest trade partners. It is also uncertain whether it is possible to find a CBAM, which would be compatible with WTO rules.  The primary solution from a business point of view is to promote regulation globally that guarantees fair and equitable competition for businesses. Here are some examples:
o	more regular dialogue between WTO and UNFCCC forums 
o	using new and existing regional trade agreements (RTAs) to find common ground and compromise on integration of climate and trade issues
o	talks with like-minded WTO Members, for instance the EU and China could revive negotiations on the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA)
o	under WTO, include climate-related issues in the WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) on a voluntary basis

Also, revised EU trade defence instruments have been strengthened, and if there is evidence of unfair competition, the first action should be to find ways to help EU´s trade partners to improve their policies, for example by implementing carbon pricing and promoting trade in climate-friendly goods and services.

The introduction of a CBA in the UE under the compliance of WTO rules has to deal with five practical challenges:
•	Ensure equal treatment for internal and external products coexistent with the ETS and the EU energy taxation. This may convey the discussion on certain critical issues such as a) the integration of importers into the ETS, b) the existence of carbon taxes for final consumers, and inevitably c) the compatibility with the free allowance to industries in risk of carbon leakage.
•	Introduce climate change into international trade rules: Climate change is a global environmental risk, but climate protection or climate change mitigation are not so far explicitly quoted. The Paris Agreement subscribed by 195 countries opens the time to considerate climate issues into the international trade rules, either as the basis for a standard or technical rule or as an exception. The OMS addressed in COP24 climate change as a risk for human health.
•	The imposition of a CBA based on the carbon content of an import. The current interpretation of trading rules understands that 2 products are equivalent as far as they are perfect substitutes and respond to the same consumer demand. From this perspective, a CBA based on actual carbon content would require agreement at WTO level. However, the introduction of WTO standards and/or technical rules relative to carbon content may facilitate the differentiation of the products and accordingly their treatment vis-à-vis border taxes. Standards on carbon emission best practices and climate friendly products could be explored to support CBA.
•	The treatment of different countries with different commitments in climate action. The WTO rules impose equal treatment for all the countries which may be controversial when dealing with States with radical different positions relative to environmental targets and tools. Hence the elaboration of transparent and validated technical standards may provide a tool to implement CBA.
•	The destination of the funds raised through the CBA. The WTO rules exclude explicitly the use of export subsidies. However, nothing excludes to allocate part/all the funds towards general budget needs and more specifically, towards decarbonistation and sustainability targets. Earmarking a relevant part of the funds to transfer to developing countries for decarbonisation purposes in the context of the Paris Agreement is not only compliant with WTO rules but would help offsetting the controversies around the CBA.
Full internalisation of industry’s GHG emission cost is key to ensure that such cost is passed through the value chain setting up strong incentives from the producers to the consumers. Tackling the carbon leakage issue through free allocation of CO2 allowances in the most exposed industries has been effective in terms of protecting the sectors in risk of transferring emissions from unfair international competition through relocation, but ineffective in terms of preserving the incentives to decarbonise because is neither of universal application for other sectors under unfair international competition (eg electricity sector) nor avoids effectively carbon emissions. 
The CBA represents a new approach which could either fully replace the existing carbon leakage measures or complement them while global robust CO2 mechanisms develop. Besides, indirect CO2 costs (like those internalised in electricity costs) could also be tackled through the CBA. Additionally, this approach should be framed in within an intense climate diplomacy activity – leaded by the EU – and aligned with UNFCCC climate negotiations.

The goals of FACE and the proposed EU CBAM coincide: levelling the playing field for EU industries on the domestic and export markets and preventing escape of EU industrial production to third countries with lower or no CO2 emission costs. 
But FACE is concerned that if the proposed CBAM does not take into account particularities of the EU aluminium sector, it may become a useless, if not counter-productive, trade policy measure. 
The EU aluminium sector consists of two main subsectors: 
Primary aluminium (PA), producers of unwrought metal (smelters, which transform alumina into PA; refiners and  re-melters, which produce secondary recycled aluminium from scrap); 
DS, downstream aluminium transformers (extruders, rollers, foundry casters; manufactures of aluminium parts and components). 
The global aluminium demand should increase by over 150% by 2050, supplied by primary and by recycled metal sources, with a trend that sees the primary/secondary ratio going from actual 3/1 to 5/3 in the next 20 years, primary remaining the key point for the aluminium growth in the next decades.
FACE considers that the two subsectors have been developing over the last 30 years in different way and should be treated separately when considering an EU CBAM. 
Due to growing energy and labour costs, aluminium smelters, the main reference for the raw material, started relocating EU production to third countries long time ago. Today, the EU PA segment may cover only about 25 % of EU demand the rest being imported. 
During the same period of time, the EU DS aluminium segment has been growing to meet EU demand and compete on third markets. Thus, the EU DS segment is completely import dependent of unwrought PA metal which surprisingly remains subject to EU import duties varying between 3 % - 6 %. 
This on-going EU trade policy severely increases EU market prices of unwrought PA and negatively affects competitiveness of the whole EU DS segment which today represents approximately 90 % of the turnover and jobs in the EU aluminium sector. Most EU DS producers are SMEs. 
CBAM as to the DS segment. As DS aluminium producers are paying growing ECT costs and are competing with unfairly priced imports, FACE supports the introduction of a CBAM  for all imported aluminium semis and finished products in EU. 
FACE would like to stress that the future CBAM must be WTO compliant and cover all products of all sectors with similar carbon footprint (and not only steel, cement and some other sectors as currently contemplated by the Commission), except for areas which could be excluded on the basis of objective and transparent criteria, such as lack or non-existence of EU domestic production, like in case of the PA segment. 
CBAM as to the PA segment. CBAM is not an appropriate measure for the PA segment from the point of view of the two pillars of carbon leakage. It would only increase costs of the DS segment further and lead to massive closures and/or leakage of that important sector of the EU economy abroad, and would become another EU trade policy measure, along with the current EU import tariffs on PA. 
Instead of including the PA segment into the CBAM, the Commission is invited to consider immediately a PA import tariff suspension repeatedly requested by FACE and DS SME’s. Such suspension would serve the EU Green Deal and what the EU wants to achieve with the CBAM if the EU suspended the current import tariffs on low carbon PA  faster (within the next few months) and deeper (zero tariff). Such full tariff suspension would be a perfect example of a timely measure taken in harmony with several important EU policies, such as environmental, industrial and trade. Moreover, such measure would constitute an urgently needed economic stimulus for the EU aluminium industry in the COVID-19 context.

We defend the interests of all workers in the metal and textile sectors, thanks to the daily work of our 10 000 activists and the confidence of our 220 000 members and the valuable contribution of all employees to the organisation.

ACV-CSC METEA welcomes the principle of border carbon adjustment. We believe this tool is a first step towards reconciling the defence of energy-intensive industries and the decarbonised economy. By applying the “polluter pays” principle, this tool will finally allow for fair competition at global level rather than simply outsourcing pollution. This principle is also attractive in terms of its apparent simplicity of establishment and its compliance with WTO rules.

This principle could become a key industrial policy tool in pursuit of a number of complementary and interlinked goals:

1. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions

2. The defence of the EU’s highly strategic industrial sectors and the defence of workers in these sectors

3. applying global fair competition

Reducing greenhouse gases in energy-intensive industries will most likely be through innovation of disruptions. However, it is clear that these technologies and innovations will result in a high cost, which could have a significant impact on employment in Europe if they are not properly monitored and accompanied. It is therefore of utmost importance according to ACV-CCS MEEA to ensure that the carbon border policy is not in place on its own, but is accompanied by a set of policy and/or fiscal measures that will allow the border adjustment to be an adjuvant to the pursuit of 3 objectives mentioned above.

Specific measures in public procurement could also be envisaged. The creation of a market that will be able to welcome these innovations is therefore essential.
A mechanism also supporting exporters should also be considered.
Care must be taken to estimate and weigh the impact on all parts of the value chain. Downstream industries will inevitably be more affected than upstream industries. It will not be necessary for these measures to be lost through any inadequacy of the target and to destroy sectors.
Conversely, it will not be necessary for this measure to promote deadweight effects.
Finally, the implementation of this tool will not be possible without a debate on several issues relating to it:
What about free allowances?
What about the interaction with the ETS?
What about the interaction with the Trade Defense Instruments?

Cet outil, en appliquant le principe du pollueur payeur permettra d'enfin établir une concurrence loyale au niveau mondial et non plus simplement externaliser la pollution. Ce principe est aussi attractif par son apparente simplicité de mise en place ainsi que sa conformité avec les règles de l'OMC.

Ce principe pourrait devenir un outil de politique industrielle essentiel dans la poursuite de plusieurs objectifs complémentaires et interconnectés :

1. La réduction des émissions de gaz à effets de serre

2. La défense des secteurs industriels éminemment stratégiques de l'Union Européenne et ainsi la défense des travailleurs de ces secteurs

La réduction des gaz à effets de serre dans les industries intensives en énergie se fera plus que probablement au travers d'innovation de ruptures. Or, il est clair ces technologies et innovations de ruptures se feront à un cout élevé qui pourraient déboucher sur des conséquences importantes pour l'emploi en Europe si elles ne sont pas correctement monitorées et accompagnées. C'est pourquoi il est primordial selon ACV-CSC METEA d'assurer que la politique d'ajustement carbone aux frontières ne soit pas mise en place seule, mais soit accompagnée d'un faisceau de mesures politique et/ou fiscales qui permettront de faire cet ajustement aux frontières un adjuvant de la poursuite de 3 objectifs susmentionnés.
Ainsi, un cadre politique/légal/réglementaire/concurrentiel propice à l'innovation se doit d'être un prérequis à l'introduction du principe d'ajustement carbone aux frontières. Des mesures spécifiques dans les marché publics pourraient aussi être envisagés. La création d'un marché qui sera en mesure d'accueillir ces innovations est de ce fait indispensable.
 Un mécanisme soutenant aussi les exportateurs devrait également être envisagé.

European farmers, forest owners and their cooperatives are the first to feel the impact of climate change. We are committed to implementing the Paris Agreement and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.
The CBAM in principle could work as a measure to avoid carbon leakage in all sectors. It is of the utmost relevance in emission-intensive sectors in which the ETS system is already in place. Additional production requirements have to be corrected by a compensating adjustment mechanism.
Carbon pricing mechanisms in agriculture and forestry should be based on the carbon farming framework envisaged by the Commission and be compliant with the CAP. Within this scope, the carbon dioxide that farmers remove (negative emissions) would also be recognised in traded goods according to their production method. This carbon farming framework must neither contradict the Emission Trading Scheme nor the Effort Sharing Regulation. The special role of agriculture in climate action, as laid out in the Paris Agreement, has to be recognised.
In addition to climate measures like the CBAM, the Commission should bear in mind that other issues such as biodiversity, deforestation and animal welfare also need attention as far as sustainable production in general is concerned. Carbon border adjustments on agricultural goods must be based on the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles, including carbon sequestration. If agricultural and forestry products fall within the scope of the CBAM, principles should be elaborated in close cooperation with farmers and forest owners.
	The CBAM must be compatible with the WTO and other international trade commitments.
	It must minimise administrative burdens where possible (e.g. avoid double taxation or no taxation), and not have any adverse effects on the environment or climate. It is assumed that monitoring and reporting systems need to be in place. This is in order to understand whether the CBAM should be applied to a product or whether to provide a reduction or exclusion to a specific trade partner proven to have similar climate policies to the EU. In addition, the carbon pricing calculation of a specific product may evolve with technological advances.
	The CBAM should be thoroughly assessed and carefully thought through along the entire food chain. This is because it may also have an impact on the level playing field for EU production (e.g. imports of soya to feed EU poultry vs imports of poultrymeat from poultry fed with soya from third countries). It remains unclear how the calculation of emissions in agriculture and forestry could be carried out (e.g. there are currently no precedents that specifically address the issue of inputs that are entirely used up in the production process). Therefore, it would be mandatory for the Commission to undertake a thorough impact assessment along the entire value chain prior to initiating any CBAM.
o	The European Commission must reject flat-rate calculation methods, which are based on theoretical assumptions and do not reflect actual emissions.

This should be calculated and the difference in GHG content should be priced for imports. A certain reference level of GHG emissions must be “duty free”.

Such a mechanism is a fundamental tool for the implementation of an effective climate policy in a globalised economy and to ensure international competitiveness of European industries. The support of appropriate carbon pricing should send a clear message for long-term sustainable investment to back the transition to carbon neutrality by 2050 while preventing employment and market shares losses within the European Union. In this respect EPF calls on the European Commission to consider the following points when elaborating its proposals for a carbon border adjustment mechanism:

•	Since the actual calculation to decide whether an industry can be included into the carbon leakage list is based on the direct and indirect carbon costs of its products, the actual embodied carbon content of imported products should similarly be considered within the framework of the BCA mechanism;
•	In order to avoid delocalisation and to promote effectiveness in carbon leakage prevention, all products’ related carbon emissions should be taken into account and specifically those related to transport. More specifically, the ‘cradle to gate’ approach for raw materials (EN 15804) within the framework of the Environmental Product Declaration fails to reflect transport carbon emissions. A common EN standard should therefore be developed to encompass transport related emissions for both EU manufactured and imported products;
•	More stringent measures should be considered for imported products manufactured in non-EU countries that are not signatories of international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement;
•	Attention should be given to potential attempts to bypass the carbon border adjustment mechanism for imported semi-finished products. Exporters may try to bypass the mechanism by moving up or down the value chain to trade precursors or derivatives instead of the product itself. Action should therefore be taken to discourage this type of behaviour;
•	The scope and levels of the carbon border adjustment mechanism should comply with EU, WTO and other international rules;
•	Unnecessary administrative complexity and compliance costs should be avoided.

Given the proposed increase of the EU’s climate ambition (also compared to other countries in the world) it is necessary to reflect the mitigation targets in trade policy in order to avoid carbon leakage (and as a consequence a global rise of GHG emissions). A carbon border adjustment mechanism should be practicable in daily international trade, especially with processed and „mixed“food. How to calculate it for a pizza? We need concrete concepts for this, also for imported products like nitrogen fertilizers. At least there should be a different tariff between countries who join the Paris Agreement and those who don’t. It is also necessary not only to reflect differing climate ambitions and standards of agricultural production in trade policy, but also diverging environmental standards (e.g. allowed plant protectants, livestock standards, protection of pristine landscapes and forests, …).

Regarding the calculation of the carbon content and carbon price of products and potential impact on EU market of agricultural produce a life cycle / value chain calculation of emissions is needed to establish a carbon border adjustment mechanism. Also a reference level for an accepted amount of N2O and CH4 emissions has to be set. It cannot be zero. This could be done by defining a standard GHG content / GHG reference level from EU agricultural products. It should be calculated and for imports the difference in GHG content should be priced.

•	The European cement industry already faces a strong risk of carbon leakage despite the partial free allocation provided under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). This risk is increasing at a very fast pace, as third countries which are not subject to the same CO2 constraints build up their export capacity to the EU.

•	A carbon border mechanism could create the level playing field the industry needs to deliver low-carbon investments and move towards carbon neutrality along the value chain. It could also incentivise third countries to step up their efforts on climate change, and ensure that the EU does not “outsource” its CO2 emissions through the import of more CO2-intensive products. 

•	However, carbon border mechanisms are by nature complex tools and it is essential to get their design right. A poorly-designed mechanism could indeed have dramatic consequences for the industry.     

•	In particular, it is imperative that any carbon border mechanism co-exists with free allocation under the EU ETS, at least until the end of Phase IV. The replacement of the existing carbon leakage measures by an untested mechanism would create considerable uncertainty and risks for investments in the EU, at a time the industry needs a predictable framework to deliver low-carbon investments. 

•	The core objective of a carbon border mechanism should be that producers outside the EU compete on the same CO2 cost basis as EU domestic producers. With this in mind, CEMBUREAU suggests some design principles which are fair and transparent for both EU and non-EU producers, will have a positive impact on climate worldwide, and will avoid carbon leakage and imported CO2 emissions. These 5 design principles are as follows: 

1.	In an initial phase, an EU carbon border mechanism must be complementary to the EU ETS free allowances
2.	A carbon border mechanism must be based on verified emissions from importers to the EU. It should include indirect emissions.
3.	A carbon border mechanism must follow a very transparent methodology and be fully WTO-compatible 
4.	An EU carbon border mechanism must be applicable to all ETS sectors alike
5.	A carbon border mechanism should provide for an CO2 charge exemption for EU exporters

France and Europe have become aware that their climate policy weakens their champions without reducing global emissions and that it leads to the transfer of emissions across borders. 

This is why the French business movement (MEDEF) is in favour of a carbon adjustment mechanism at Europe’s borders primarily applied to relevant European sectors on a voluntary basis. This will make it possible to:
• To establish a level playing field and reduce carbon leakage
• Valuing the ability of the industry to produce the green solutions of tomorrow in Europe
• To increase the efficiency of the European emission allowance market by encouraging countries exporting to the European market to develop climate policies. 

The following legal, economic and technical conditions must be taken into account:
• To comply with WTO rules, with the single objective of ensuring the same level of environmental and climate requirements for all products consumed on the European market without a protectionist aim; 
Maintain key coherence with existing support mechanisms (maintenance of free ETS allowances and the indirect cost compensation scheme) as long as the effectiveness of the scheme is not proven. 
• Take into account the complexity of value chains (imports, exports, compensations for the importing sectors: Cement, steel, chemistry,...) and downstream exporters (aeronautics, chemicals, automobiles, etc.) and to ensure the competitiveness of exports to countries where the carbon constraint is less ambitious than in Europe, and to combat victimisation and circumvention;
• Assigned revenue to finance the transition for exposed economic actors (businesses and households), compensation for additional costs and innovation;
• Ensure a robust and auditable system of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), taking into account the carbon content of energy consumed and imports.

The MEDEF wishes to:
— Contributing to experimentation, measuring its effectiveness in terms of reducing the carbon footprint and global emissions, assessing its impact on exports to third countries, and defining the accompanying measures and the conditions for its extension; 
— Contribute to its extension to other sectors and including final products. 

The MEDEF considers that such a mechanism, which is necessary to restore the competitiveness of European technology leaders, must be accompanied by additional measures essential to achieving carbon neutrality: Maintain reliable and competitive access to energy and organise the financing of the investments that will be massive.

Finally, the MEDEF recommends further climate approaches: 
• Search for convergence of climate policies through carbon prices, analyse the impact of these prices on trade,
• Promoting climate standards in trade agreements
• Establishing carbon clubs applying trade sanctions to third countries not respecting the Paris Agreement
• Harmonise European tax systems (energy, VAT) on the basis of carbon content.

C’est pourquoi le Mouvement des entreprises de France (MEDEF) est en faveur d’un mécanisme d'ajustement carbone aux frontières de l’Europe appliqué en premier lieu à des secteurs européens pertinents sur une base volontaire. Celui-ci permettra de :
•	Rétablir les conditions d’une concurrence équitable et réduire les fuites de carbone
•	Valoriser la capacité de l’industrie à produire en Europe les solutions vertes de demain

•	Se conformer aux règles de l’OMC, avec pour objectif unique de garantir le même niveau d’exigence environnementale et climatique de tous les produits consommés sur le marché européen sans visée protectionniste ; 
•	Maintenir la cohérence essentielle avec les mécanismes de soutien existants (maintien des quotas ETS gratuits et du système de compensation des coûts indirects) tant que l’efficacité du dispositif n’est pas prouvée. 
•	Prendre en compte la complexité des chaînes de valeur (importations, exportations, compensations pour les secteurs importateurs : ciment, acier, chimie, ...) et ré-exportateurs en aval (aéronautique, chimie, automobile, etc.) et assurer la compétitivité des exportations vers des pays où la contrainte carbone est moins ambitieuse qu'en Europe, et lutter contre les mesures de rétorsions et les contournements ;

Le MEDEF souhaite :
-	Contribuer à l’expérimentation, mesurer son efficacité en termes de baisse de l’empreinte carbone et des émissions mondiales, évaluer ses impacts sur les exportations vers les pays tiers, et définir les mesures d’accompagnement et les conditions de son extension ; 
-	Contribuer à son extension à d’autres secteurs et y compris sur les produits finaux. 

Le MEDEF considère qu’un tel mécanisme, nécessaire pour rétablir la compétitivité de leaders technologiques européens, doit s’accompagner de mesures complémentaires indispensables pour atteindre la neutralité carbone :  maintenir un accès fiable et compétitif à l’énergie et organiser le financement des investissements qui seront massifs.

•	Rechercher la convergence des politiques climatiques via des prix du carbone, analyser les impacts de ces prix sur les échanges commerciaux, 
•	Promouvoir des standards climatiques dans les accords commerciaux 
•	Mettre en place des clubs carbone appliquant des sanctions commerciales aux pays tiers ne respectant pas l’accord de Paris

In the frame of the EU climate strategy, the European Union will have the challenge of designing policy that will reduce CO2 emissions and encourage greener industry in Europe, while avoiding making European industry less competitive both in the internal market and on the world market. In avoiding carbon leakage, the EU must also avoid the “leakage” of the strength of European industry. It’s already a fact for some industries in Bulgaria who export their production facilities to third countries.
 
A proposal has been made to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax for materials and/or products imported to the EU. The European Commission has suggested that applying a charge on imported goods based on the embedded carbon emitted (during production) would be a good way to avoid carbon leakage and to keep European companies competitive. However, it must be stressed that such a measure would have the exact opposite effect on the EU industry of finished goods, if a carbon tax were introduced only on raw materials such as steel, aluminum and plastics. If a carbon tax were only applied to imported raw materials, it would affect finished goods produced within the EU, but not outside it. This would make finished goods produced in Europe more expensive, and therefore less favourable for European consumers.
 
Thus, if a carbon adjustment import tax is introduced for raw materials, it must also be introduced for finished goods.

Imposing a tax on imported raw materials without extending it to finished goods would create a clear incentive for businesses to move their manufacturing plants outside the EU, both taking jobs and ultimately leading to an increase in carbon emissions (the very leakage that the border tax was designed to fight against). Furthermore, this tax would simply shift the problem of carbon leakage from the raw materials industry to the industry of finished goods without tackling the problem, while simultaneously damaging the European economy and leading to cases of cascading protectionism as seen since the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs in 2018.
 
In conclusion, the European Commission should be commended for its intentions in developing a greener economy that remains based in a system of free trade. However, the European Green Deal, by its nature, remains a continental response to a global problem. Imposing regulation that has an impact on European manufacturers must be considered in the context of the global economy for all industry sectors and not only for the industry of raw materials.

Discussions about possible conflicts with WTO rules have run out of steam and, anyway, Climate issues are so critical that they ought to take precedence over trade issues - a further step in world governance, if the present COVID-19  crisis is resolved and the world that comes out of it is still interested in this type of question.
Local (regional) production of steel, as an example,  is essential and, as a matter of fact, makes a lot of sense for a long list of reasons, including fit-to-market and costs.  Large discrepancies between prices, introduced by strong gradients between local climate policies, ought to be put under control, quickly and effectively. The CBAM looks like the best way to achieve this. 
Now the CBAM should be implemented, eventually, to cover the full material flow, for example of steel. 
Indeed, steel, as a commodity material ,accounts for less than 60% of international trade, the rest being embedded in final consumption goods, like automobiles, mechanical equipment, etc. There are simple methods, based on simplified LCA, which can measure the carbon content of steel in an automotive or whatever else. 
It should not be assumed that all foreign producers are doing worse than the European in terms of GHG emissions related to, say, steel. China in particular, has been improving its act very quickly and convincingly. 
Anyway, the major point of CBAM should be to make Climate mitigation practices more universal across the world: when this happens, the CBAM will end up not yielding much  money, which is its intended outcome.

The BA aims at making the EU ETS more effective for climate protection and avoiding or reducing existing and potential competitive disadvantages and carbon leakage. 

2.	Coverage
The BA should apply to imports, not to exports. It imposes a charge equivalent to the EU ETS to imported products or services. 

3.	Sectors
The BA should first only cover one climate-intensive sector. If effective, it could be extended to further climate-intensive sectors. Aluminium, cement, or steel might be included first. Final products could also be considered as these are traded more. Of services, aviation might be included. 

4.	Calculation 
The BA on products could be calculated on the basis of the lowest product price imposed by the EU ETS. The price the most efficient EU installation paid for EU ETS certificates needs to be divided by its production volume of the same period to calculate the price per product. This price could be the benchmark for the BA for this type of product for the following commitment period. As climate-intensive goods, even if produced in the most climate-efficient way, have a certain minimum emission intensity, a price-based BA would be more effective than the EU ETS is today without the BA. Such BA would also not discriminate against imported products. Manipulation of data would be difficult. Data from abroad would be unnecessary. 

The carbon footprint (CF) is not recommended as it is too discretionary. It is not clear which greenhouse gases it includes, whether it includes only the production process or the whole life cycle of a product. Emissions are not objectively verifiable in traded products. The measurement of the CF would be bureaucratic and costly. Furthermore, measuring the CF would require data from abroad which are not (always) available and doubted to be reliable. The CF is not free from the suspicion of discrimination.

5.	WTO rules
To avoid WTO disputes and trade conflicts, the strictest interpretation of WTO rules should be applied. The price-based approach suggested under (4.) is non-discriminatory according to the strict interpretation of non-discrimination rules of the WTO. To avoid discrimination, the BA should enter into force not before the EU ETS applies full auctioning.

6.	Paris Agreement
Cooperative approaches under Article 6 Paris Agreement should be negotiated with all its Parties before establishing the BA and be regularly re-negotiated. Double-counting must be avoided (Article 6(2) Paris Agreement). If imported products or services have been charged by a carbon price in another country, the BA might be lowered for trading partners of this state if the foreign instrument is, at least, equivalent to the EU ETS. The EU can establish an exchange rate that partly lowers the BA if equivalence is only partly provided. 

7.	Aviation
The BA may extend to the aviation sector but only for the distance flown in EU airspace (avoiding violations of the Chicago Convention that all EU States are bound to) and only to the extent the emissions were not covered by Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). 

8.	Exemptions 
The BA can include exemptions for traders from low emitting states and least developing countries but without making the BA ineffective. Re-routing of traded products and services must be avoided. If exemptions are made, they should depend on quantifiable parameters, preferably the human development index (HDI) and the emissions per capita.

9.	Sanctions 
Penalty rates may not be higher than the costs for sanctions for like products or services falling under the EU ETS.

10.	Revenue 
100 per cent of the revenue from the BA should be used for the Green Climate Fund or another international climate fund under the Paris Agreement or the UNFCCC.

Abstract:

One element of the proposed European Green Deal is a border carbon adjustment mechanism. The introduction of a BCA would allow the EU to phase out current carbon leakage provisions of the ETS and to auction off all emission allowances, thus rendering the ETS a more effective unilateral tool to price and reduce carbon emissions. In theory a BCA would be a perfect instrument to ensure a level playing field for domestic and foreign producers, thus avoiding potential carbon leakage. Until now, however, the legal and administrative issues of implementation have been deemed too huge to overcome. We derive a WTO-compatible (full) border tax adjustment (BTA) design that could be implemented in the near future, and we estimate potential EU BCA and BTA revenues using a dynamic new Keynesian (DYNK) model. The BTA design of our choice would generate substantial and stable revenues that could be used as innovative sustainability-oriented own resource to finance the EU budget. We find that estimated revenues would suffice to finance between 5% and 7% of the EU’s expenditure in the coming Multiannual Financial Framework period 2021-2027 and up to 16% in the year 2050. This new revenue source would allow Member States to reduce their current contributions to the EU budget accordingly and would thus create space to cut other more distortionary taxes at the national level, enabling an EU-wide supranational sustainability-enhancing tax shift. Thus, a BTA could contribute to tackle both environmental and fiscal challenges currently facing the EU.

We are pleased that both the Green Deal Communication and the Inception Impact Assessment for the CBAM acknowledge the problem of carbon leakage, and that the Commission is proposing a new measure aimed at tackling it (i.e. the CBAM). However, we have serious reservations about whether a CBAM is the most suitable measure for addressing carbon leakage, especially if it is considered an “alternative” to the existing measures. Although the current carbon leakage measures (and especially indirect cost compensation) are still in need of improvement, they offered a crucial minimum level of protection over the course of Phase III of the EU ETS, and therefore replacing them could lead to absolutely catastrophic consequences for Europe’s energy-intensive industry. Hence, If a CBAM is not capable of creating a level playing field with regard to indirect costs , then it cannot guard against the risk of carbon leakage, and therefore the current system of indirect cost compensation would absolutely have to be maintained.
The main problem relates to if and how a CBAM could be applied to sectors characterised by a high level of electrification (e.g. aluminium). This is likely to become a problem for more and more sectors in the future, given that the Commission’s 2050 Long-Term Strategy stresses the importance of electrifying as many industrial processes as possible if we are to have any chance of reaching climate neutrality. 
Before implementing any CBAM, it is crucial to ensure that the CBAM has been proven to work at least as well (if not better) than the current carbon leakage measures. Introducing a new “system”, replacing existing measures, should also seek to simplify, rather than complicate the EU economy’s interaction with trade partners on account of climate policies, including developing countries, which are genuinely not in a position to “synchronize” with the ambitious targets set by the EU. 
Moreover, it should ensure smooth implementation within the EU but also member-states, taking into consideration that existing carbon leakage measures have matured over-time and -though not perfect- significant improvements have been achieved, boosting the efficiency of the ETS system as the flagship tool of the EU in its climate efforts. 
This may require some form of overlap period (where both the CBAM and the current measures are applied), in order to ensure that the CBAM ‘matures’ and is actually capable of working as intended. However, if (as seems likely) the above issues cannot be resolved, then Europe should instead focus on improving the current carbon leakage measures, in order to ensure that the competitiveness of European industry is maintained while it continues its efforts to decarbonise, thereby also avoiding the risk of catastrophic carbon leakage (which would completely undermine the achievement of Europe’s climate goals).

en,509909,IRL,Gas Networks Ireland,Thatt-Foley,PUBLISHED,2020-03-30 17:32:27,False,Ares(2020)1350037,,False,Sarah,"Gas Networks Ireland (GNI), along with its parent company Ervia, welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback on the “EU Green Deal – Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.” GNI acknowledges that this mechanism will move towards protecting the competitiveness of the European economy.  It will also leverage the decarbonisation potential of Europe’s existing energy infrastructure, and in doing so, minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers, meeting ‘Just Transition’ objectives.

Having reviewed the Roadmap, GNI makes the following observations: 

1.	‘Growth strategy impacts on innovation and research – opportunity for growth of green technologies
GNI fully supports the ambition of the European Green Deal to “transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society…with a competitive economy”, an economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and not threatened by carbon leakage.  GNI acknowledges this growth strategy and notes that green technologies proven to contribute to decarbonisation goals also represent positive opportunities:

•	Renewable biomethane, which is net zero carbon and fully compatible with the existing gas networks, represents the least cost and least disruptive way to decarbonise home heating. 
•	For the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a necessity.  CCS with Bioenergy has the potential to deliver negative emissions.
•	In the longer term, hydrogen will play a major role in the EU’s energy mix. Renewable hydrogen can be produced using Power to Gas technology that utilises excess renewable electricity. Hydrogen can also be produced from Natural Gas, and when combined with CCS technology decarbonised hydrogen can be produced. 

2.	Prioritising a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy
Delivering a carbon adjustment will make it more expensive to import carbon-intensive products and thereby potentially impact on a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy. With the Green Deal emphasising the need for a just and socially balanced transition, GNI supports the view that:

•	Gases such as natural gas, biomethane and hydrogen should remain part of the energy mix and will help protect downstream jobs in energy-intensive industries. 
•	Least cost and least disruptive technologies are deployed, with electrification, natural gas with CCS, renewable gases and renewable electricity all set to play significant roles in the 2050 energy system. 
•	Several studies have shown that renewable and decarbonised gas provide the least disruptive way of decarbonising heating across the EU.  
•	Leveraging the decarbonisation potential within Europe’s existing energy infrastructure will also minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers.  

3.	Working in Partnership - Incentivising trade partners towards climate ambition
The EU Green Deal identifies the importance of “partnerships with industry and Member States” and the European Commission proposes to work strategically with sector partners to raise global ambition in respect of climate. Incentivising trade partners to decarbonise through the border adjustment will have an impact on global CO2 emissions. It may also provide the platform for the EU to become a leader in key technologies which enable the development of hydrogen, including the electrolysers needed to produce Green Hydrogen.
Europe is home to energy intensive industries, including the chemical and steel sectors, which have intensive energy and heat requirements in their production processes.  GNI proposes that revenues recouped as a result of the carbon border re-adjustment are ring-fenced and reinvested in technologies, such as CCS and hydrogen, which will help decarbonise these industries. Policy and fiscal support for sectors already on a positive 2050 trajectory is also valid and will assist in the development and commercialisation of new energy technologies, ensuring their competiveness.

EUROALLIAGES recommends the following:

1.	Any CBAM system that intends to replace or remove the carbon leakage regime featured by the ETS Directive should be disregarded. We invite the European Commission to reflect on scenarios in which CBAM will adequately complement the necessary carbon leakage protection of highly exposed sectors like the one represented by EUROALLIAGES.  
2.	The upcoming impact assessment should be the starting point of a broader discussion between the EU institutions and all the stakeholders potentially concerned. The debate should not be detached from the New Industrial Strategy and the upcoming Climate Law.
3.	The impact assessment should address WTO compliance and the potential interlinks between different CBAMs and EU’s trade defence instruments. 
4.	While EUROALLIAGES is open to CBAM trials for selected sectors, the European Commission should provide details about the expected impacts for the sectors that will fall outside the scope of the mechanism and, ultimately, explain how these will be protected from higher carbon leakage risk.
5.	EUROALLIAGES is ready to contribute with material and data to be assessed as a specific sector that may benefit from a future CBAM.

In avoiding carbon leakage, the EU must also avoid the “leakage” of the strength of European industry.
 
A  proposal has been made to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax for materials and/or products imported to the EU. The European Commission has suggested that applying a charge on imported goods based on the embedded carbon emitted (during production) would be a good way to avoid carbon leakage and to keep European companies competitive. However, it must be stressed that such a measure would have the exact opposite effect on the EU industry of finished goods, if a carbon tax were introduced only on raw materials such as steel, aluminum and plastics. If a carbon tax were only applied to imported raw materials, it would affect finished goods produced within the EU, but not outside it. This would make finished goods produced in Europe more expensive, and therefore less favourable for European consumers.
 
Thus, if a carbon adjustment import tax is introduced for raw materials, it must also be introduced for finished goods.

Imposing a tax on imported raw materials without extending it to finished goods would create a clear incentive for businesses to move their manufacturing plants outside the EU, both taking jobs and ultimately leading to an increase in carbon emissions (the very leakage that the border tax was designed to fight against). Furthermore, this tax would simply shift the problem of carbon leakage from the raw materials industry to the industry of finished goods without tackling the problem, while simultaneously damaging the European economy and leading to cases of cascading protectionism as seen since the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs in 2018.
 
In conclusion, the European Commission should be commended for its intentions in developing a greener economy that remains based in a system of free trade. However, the European Green Deal, by its nature, remains a continental response to a global problem. Imposing regulation that has an impact on European manufacturers must be considered in the context of the global economy for all industry sectors and not only for the industry of raw materials.

The home appliance industry in Europe alone employs over 920,000 direct and indirect workers and includes over 3,000 enterprises. APPLiA supports global decarbonization efforts and thinks European industry is well-positioned to be a global leader in green technology. The Commission is encouraged to explore  solutions such as supporting green steel production and clean energy sources, as well as stimulating demand for low-carbon products globally.",,04201463642-88,withinfo,business_association,small,closed,7587254,

Uprigaz noted that there were two weaknesses in the HTA mechanism:
If the ETS allows certain industrial sectors to avoid paying a carbon tax in the European Union, the scheme does not protect these industries against international competition from third countries which have not adopted environmental rules — on air, water and biodiversity — equivalent to European legislation. It is also observed that these countries have less protective social rules than the EU rules.

• This system does not cover all economic sectors for which, however, energy and the environment are significant factors of production.

UPRINAZ is therefore in favour of a development of the European system of taxation at the borders which we think should be based on the following points:
• The establishment of this mechanism should be gradual.
• The European system should be extended at international level, and at least to the G7 countries.
• The products of this border tax should be redistributed to each of the economic sectors concerned in order to place them in a level playing field. In this diagram, the ETS would disappear and all European players would be subject to the internal carbon tax.
 
UPRINAZ would also like the carbon component of electricity consumed by electro-intensive consumers to be included in the HTA mechanism.",False,UPRIGAZ,"L’UPRIGAZ accueille favorablement l’initiative de la Commission européenne visant à parvenir à mettre en place un nouveau mécanisme permettant à la fois d’éviter des fuites de carbone et de placer l’ensemble des acteurs économiques de l’Union européenne sur un pied d’égalité avec leurs concurrents à l’échelle mondiale.
 
L’UPRIGAZ observe que le mécanisme de l’ETS connait deux faiblesses :
•	Si l’ETS permet à certains secteurs industriels d’éviter de supporter une taxe carbone dans l’Union européenne, le dispositif ne protège pas ces industriels contre la concurrence internationale de pays tiers qui n’ont pas adopté une réglementation environnementale – sur l’air, l’eau et la biodiversité - équivalente à la réglementation européenne. On observe par ailleurs que ces mêmes pays disposent d’une réglementation sociale moins protectrice que la réglementation européenne,

•	Ce système ne couvre pas l’ensemble des secteurs économiques pour lesquels, néanmoins, l’énergie et l’environnement sont des facteurs de production significatifs.
 
L’UPRIGAZ est donc favorable à une évolution du système européen de taxation aux frontières dont nous pensons qu’il devrait s’appuyer sur les points suivants :
•	La mise en place de ce mécanisme devrait être progressive.
•	Le système européen devrait avoir vocation  à s’étendre au niveau international, et à tout le moins aux pays du G7.
•	Les produits de cette taxe aux frontières devraient être redistribués à chacun des secteurs économiques concernés pour les placer dans des conditions de concurrence équitable. Dans ce schéma, l’ETS aurait vocation à disparaitre et tous les acteurs européens seraient soumis à la taxe carbone intérieure
 
L’UPRIGAZ souhaiterait également que la composante carbone de l’électricité consommée par les consommateurs électro-intensifs soit incluse dans le mécanisme de l’ETS.

It should be noted that the risk of carbon leakage is not limited to the threat of relocation of activities but also impinge on daily operations and profitability and most importantly, future investments. 
It is difficult to assess whether CBAM will be a measure that can effectively create a level playing field vis-à-vis 3rd countries with no GHG obligations. We are in great doubt about this. If such a scheme is to be introduced, it is paramount that it cannot be questioned within the confines of the WTO rules. 
The EU ETS has embedded carbon leakage measures with free allowances and the possibility for MS to grant compensation for indirect costs in the electricity price. Indications that these measures could be substituted by CBAM give rise to deep concern among Norwegian undertakings. Stability of framework conditions is of key importance, not the least with regard to investments and industry need predictability.

Through the EEA-agreement, Norway is fully integrated in the internal market and have been part of the EU ETS since 2008.
It is not possible to give an adequate assessment of the legal basis without knowing the design of the measure. Should Art. 192 TFEU become the basis, one could envisage that Norway would be obliged to follow suit, given that this article is reflected inn EEA, Annex XX. Norway, neither through the EEA or otherwise, is not bound by Art. 207 and if this article forms the basis for CBAM other solutions has in case to be found regarding the EEA/EFTA countries. These undecided points give further ground for concern. Norwegian industry cannot live with such legal uncertainty.

Likely impacts are hard to determine, nevertheless we give the following remarks and questions:  
-The yet undesigned CBAM, including operational instruments (e.g. taxes, tariffs, regulations, allowances etc.) increases uncertainty for industry,
-An initial trial period encompassing steel and cement, could in principle be followed by other energy intensive sectors. Without consultations, this cannot be accepted, 
-How will CBAM cater for European export and import of intermediaries likely to go into products bound for re-export?
-The administrative burden for companies is expected to rise,
-How is the concept of ""carbon footprint"" to be defined; how to deal with complex products and advanced transnational value chains?
-WTO; 'like product', Most favoured Nation principle, Art.XX (b)?
-Possible trade restricting retaliations from key trading partners cannot be excluded,
-CBAM measures might potentially be side-lined by 3rd countries by only directing their ""green"" products to Europe, whereas carbon intensive products are directed to other markets thus having no effect on global mitigating efforts,
-Eliminating ETS free allowances and indirect cost compensation in favour of CBAM must be regarded as potentially counterproductive, both with regard to European industrial competitiveness, carbon leakage and mitigation of the global climate challenge. 
Whichever form, EU CBAM seem presently to deliver more problems than solutions for the Norwegian process industry. 

European energy intensive industry cannot be included in a CBAM system without thorough and necessary consultations. Ideas proffered so far does not cater for companies trading globally, there is no legal certainty, revenues from a potential CBAM could end up anywhere and there is no proof that any such a system would benefit the climate challenge, hinder carbon- and investment leakage, nor contribute to an international level playing field.

The Green Deal mentions the need to reduce the risk of carbon leakage should differences in the level of ambition of various regions of the World persist. 

EIGA fully supports the general idea of protecting EU industry from external imports not subjected to the same environmental standards. However, when implementing such a CBAM any action should be avoided that creates an uneven playing field in the industrial value chain. This applies in particular to market distortions by which insourced production of industrial gases by EIGA’s customer becomes more financially attractive than outsourced production by EIGA’s members which has been proven to be more energy and environmentally efficient. 

Industrial gases - predominantly air gases (such as oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) and hydrogen - play an essential role in energy-intensive industries such as metals, refineries and chemicals. In developed markets, insourced and outsourced production of these gases compete strongly with each other but – with investments aimed at achieving the highest levels of safety, industrial efficiency, environmental care and at providing low-carbon solutions – industrial gases companies have for many years demonstrated their competitiveness with their customers’ insourced production option.  It has been industrial gases companies that have been a driving force in the development of new and environmentally beneficial applications of their products.

The lack of a level playing field between outsourced and insourced production of these gases would cancel all the benefits of the outsourcing model and introduce an unacceptable market distortion, to the detriment of companies and industrial value chains that have outsourced their industrial gases requirements as well as to the environmental and energy efficiency objectives of the EU.

This would not be punitive for European industry and, conversely, it would enhances its characteristics of sustainability. The proposal to introduce ImEA has already been subject of a resolution adopted by Environment and Industry Commissions of the Italian Senate.
The basic concept is to introduce a tax on the product's carbon intensity that acts as an environmental taxation lever through the modulation of VAT rates: a relief for less emissive products (mostly European) and a consequent increase for more pollutant ones. This environmental taxation instrument doesn't have the aim of increasing tax revenues, but aims to encourage cleaner productions and to discourage less clean ones, regardless of where the goods are produced.

The proposed new VAT regime would be applied both to EU-made products and imported ones and would therefore be non-discriminatory and compatible with WTO rules.
For products made in European plants subjected to the ETS system, the carbon intensity per product unit could be attested by the already available administrative and control tools.
For products made in European plants not subjected to the ETS, or for imported products from non-EU countries, the carbon intensity per product unit with respect to the reference benchmarks could be attested by certifications issued on the basis of international standards of technical norms such as ISO 14064 and with traceability procedures such as those offered by the blockchain procedure application.

The ImEA proposal has already been presented to the European Parliament; it is considered in a positive way by ENEA, FLAEI (the main trade union for electrical workers), and by notable industrial associations.

ImEA has also been indicated by the European Economic and Social Committee among the hypotheses that the Commission is required to investigate, as well as the reform of the ETS, the carbon adjustment on the borders and, precisely, following the presentation that Prof. Gerbeti herself made at EESC, a VAT rate adjusted to the intensity of the carbon produced.

Finally, a proposal for a ImEA-similar measure was presented last May by the Spanish government to the outgoing commissioners for Climate and Energy, Miguel Arias Canete and for Economic Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, following the initiative of the Spanish minister of Energy Teresa Ribera and Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero.

The ImEA is not a duty but a new path that the EU can open to transform sustainability into one of the parameters of global competition. Indeed, the ETS Directive itself provides that measures can be introduced to support sectors exposed to carbon leakage, basing on the carbon intensity parameters adopted as benchmarks by the EU.

Our assessment is that the change should not disadvantage the strength of European industry, as it simply means that we move the CO2 emissions problem to other parts of the world.

A proposal has been made to introduce a carbon border adjustment tax for materials and/or products imported into the EU. The European Commission has proposed that a levy on imported goods based on the carbon emitted (during production) would be a good way of avoiding carbon leakage and keeping European businesses competitive. However, it must be stressed that such a measure would have the exact opposite effect on the EU: If a carbon tax was only imposed on raw materials such as steel, aluminium and plastics, if a carbon tax was imposed only on raw materials such as steel, aluminium and plastic; If a carbon tax was applied only to imported raw materials, it would affect finished goods produced in the EU but not outside it. This would make finished goods produced in Europe more expensive and therefore less favourable for European consumers.

If a levy on the production of raw materials is introduced for raw materials, it must also be introduced for finished goods.

Introducing a tax on imported raw materials without extending it to finished goods would create a clear incentive for companies to relocate their production facilities outside the EU. Moreover, this tax would simply shift the carbon leakage problem from the raw materials industry to the finished goods industry without addressing the problem, while harming the European economy.

In conclusion, the European Commission should be commended for its intentions to develop a greener economy, which is still based in a free trade system. However, the European Green affair is, by its nature, a continuous response to a global problem. The introduction of rules that affect European manufacturers must be taken into account in the context of the global economy for all industrial sectors and not just for the raw materials industry.

APPLiA — Home Appliances Sweden supports global action in the field of the environment and considers that European industry is well positioned to be a global leader in green technologies. Encourages the Commission to explore solutions to support the production of green steel and clean energy sources and to stimulate demand for low-carbon products in the world;",False,Matts,"När EU: s klimatstrategi genomförs kommer EU att ha utmaningen att utforma en politik som kommer att minska koldioxidutsläppen och uppmuntra till grönare industri i Europa, samtidigt som man undviker att göra den europeiska industrin mindre konkurrenskraftig både på den inre marknaden och på världsmarknaden. Vår bedömning är att förändringen inte får missgynna europeiska industrins styrka, då det bara innebär att vi flyttar problemet med koldioxidutsläpp till andra delar av världen.

Ett förslag har lagts fram för att införa en kolgränsjusteringsskatt för material och / eller produkter importerade till EU. Europeiska kommissionen har föreslagit att att tillämpa en avgift på importerade varor baserat på det inbäddade kolet som släpps ut (under produktionen) skulle vara ett bra sätt att undvika koldioxidläckage och att hålla europeiska företag konkurrenskraftiga. Det måste emellertid betonas att en sådan åtgärd skulle ha exakt motsatt effekt på EU: s industri av färdiga varor, om en koldioxidskatt endast infördes på råvaror som stål, aluminium och plast. Om en koldioxidskatt endast tillämpades på importerade råvaror, skulle det påverka färdiga varor som produceras inom EU, men inte utanför den. Detta skulle göra färdiga varor som produceras i Europa dyrare och därför mindre gynnsamma för europeiska konsumenter.

Om en importavgift på koljusteringar införs för råvaror måste den också införas för färdiga varor.

Att införa en skatt på importerade råvaror utan att utvidga det till färdiga varor skulle skapa ett tydligt incitament för företagen att flytta sina tillverkningsanläggningar utanför EU. Dessutom skulle denna skatt helt enkelt flytta problemet med koldioxidläckage från råvaruindustrin till industrin av färdiga varor utan att ta itu med problemet, samtidigt som den skadar den europeiska ekonomin.

Sammanfattningsvis bör Europeiska kommissionen berömmas för sina avsikter att utveckla en grönare ekonomi som fortfarande är baserad i ett system för fri handel. Emellertid förblir den europeiska gröna affären till sin natur ett kontinuerligt svar på ett globalt problem. Införande av regler som påverkar europeiska tillverkare måste beaktas i samband med den globala ekonomin för alla industrisektorer och inte bara för råvaruindustrin.

Together, we represent 27.4m customers in Europe.

We welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the “EU Green Deal – Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.” GD4S acknowledges that this mechanism will move towards protecting the competitiveness of the European economy.  It will also leverage the decarbonisation potential of Europe’s existing energy infrastructure, and in doing so, minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers, meeting ‘Just Transition’ objectives.

Having reviewed the Roadmap, we make the following observations: 

1.	Growth strategy impacts on innovation and research 
GD4S fully supports the ambition of the European Green Deal to “transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society…with a competitive economy”, an economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and not threatened by carbon leakage.  We acknowledge this growth strategy and note that green technologies proven to contribute to decarbonisation goals also represent positive opportunities:
•	Renewable biomethane, which is net zero carbon and fully compatible with the existing gas networks, represents the least cost and least disruptive way to decarbonise home heating. 
•	For the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) is a necessity. CCS with Bioenergy has the potential to deliver negative emissions.
•	In the longer term, hydrogen will play a major role in the EU’s energy mix. Renewable hydrogen can be produced using Power to Gas technology using excess renewable electricity. Hydrogen can also be produced from Natural Gas, and when combined with CCS technology decarbonised hydrogen can be produced. 

2.	Prioritising a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy
Delivering a carbon adjustment will make it more expensive to import carbon-intensive products and thereby potentially impact on a fair transition to a carbon neutral economy. With the Green Deal emphasising the need for a just and socially balanced transition, GD4S supports the view that:
•	Renewable gases (natural gas, biomethane or hydrogen) should remain part of the energy mix and will help protect downstream jobs in energy-intensive industries. 
•	Least cost and least disruptive technologies are deployed, with electrification, natural gas with CCS, renewable gases and renewable electricity all set to play significant roles in the 2050 energy system. 
•	Several studies have shown that renewable & decarbonised gas provide the least disruptive way of decarbonising heating across the EU.  
•	Leveraging the decarbonisation potential within Europe’s existing energy infrastructure will also minimise the cost of decarbonisation to industry and consumers.  

3.	Working in Partnership
The EU Green Deal identifies the importance of “partnerships with industry and Member States”. Incentivising trade partners to decarbonise through the border adjustment will have an impact on global CO2 emissions. It may also enable the EU to become a leader in key technologies which unlock the development of hydrogen, including the electrolysers needed to produce Green Hydrogen.
Europe is home to energy intensive industries, including the chemical and steel sectors, which have intensive energy and heat needs in their production processes.  We propose that revenues recouped as the result of the carbon border re-adjustment are ring-fenced and reinvested in technologies, such as CCS and hydrogen, which will help decarbonise these industries. Policy and fiscal support for sectors already on a positive 2050 trajectory is also valid and will assist in the development and commercialisation of new energy technologies, ensuring their competiveness.

The green new deal and Climate law of President Von Der Leyen is an opportunity to correct some critical distortions for Italian and European industries including European emissions policy.
The European Commission has reached the awareness that the EUETS cannot close the gap of the competitive asymmetry between European companies and those located in territories, such as India and China or the USA, which have different energy costs and are not subject to environmental obligations; but the solution proposed at the moment, the carbon border tax, will not be able to protect our economy from “high emissive” global competition and prevent the delocalization of industries outside the EU.
The carbon tax is a classic duty, which can temporarily protect European industries only within the EU territory: any industry that exports outside the EU will “carry” the price of CO2 (which is paid on production side) on the final cost of goods, losing in competitiveness. Thus, for example, steel, ceramic or paper industry that exports to Turkey will compete in there with Indian competitors who without environmental obligations will be able to offer similar goods at lower costs. Companies that produce raw materials, such as steel, will have to deal with prices of these materials that are formed internationally without additional costs of European sustainability.
Furthermore, the illusion of having structured an effective shield could induce the EU Commission to convey an even higher price of CO2 and remove free allowances from the carbon leakage sectors: a very serious risk for the manufacture industries and for their workers.
The Charge on Added Emissions  proposal provides an economically enhancement of actual CO2 emissions occurred during the manufacture of goods within the VAT, regardless of where the goods were produced. In this way, sustainability would be added to price and quality as a parameter of market competition, guaranteeing an industrial advantage for sustainable industries: a lower VAT for industries that emit within sustainable parameters (typically the vast majority of European ones) and a burden for highly emissive ones.
The traceability of “emissive transactions” could be solved through the blockchain tool. The Charge on Added Emissions represents a mechanism for equalizing environmental costs on products placed on the European market. At the same time, it creates a standard and a stimulus to reduce emissions because it does not target States which, as seen in various COP on climate change, are reluctant to adopt rules on emission reduction, but it speaks directly to industries. It proposes a parameter of international industrial competition for environmental protection.
The Charge on Added Emissions could represent a credible Italian and European proposal to fight climate change. It would benefit both the environment and industries.

The EU is not predicted to be a net importer of electricity in the coming years, but it does import electricity from, and exchange electricity with, countries on its borders such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, whose electricity sectors are heavily dependent on coal. For more details see: https://ember-climate.org/project/interconnectors-and-coal/ More interconnectors are in the pipeline, which could further increase this trend in the future.

The Western Balkans and Ukraine are part of the Energy Community Treaty and are obliged to comply with the EU’s now superseded Large Combustion Plants Directive. However their power stations are far from compliant with this legislation, adding to the appalling air pollution problems in the countries, which also impact the EU. 

Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina even plan to build more new coal power plants, built by Chinese companies, financed by Chinese banks and not compliant with EU industrial emissions legislation or State aid rules, under the assumption that they can avoid paying carbon costs until they join the EU. (See https://bankwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/China-Balkans-briefing_Dec-2019.pdf for details)

Given that EU accession is not expected within the next few years at least, this is too long to wait. Action has to be taken now. The Energy Community Treaty Contracting Parties need to introduce a carbon price. Montenegro and Ukraine have already made some first steps, but there is little incentive for others to follow their steps, or for these countries to ensure that carbon prices are high enough to be a real deterrent, if they are also allowed to keep selling their electricity to the EU under the same conditions as now. 

In the electricity sector, a carbon border tax would encourage ETS countries to continue their phase-out of coal-based electricity. In non-ETS countries, if set at a level high enough to be a deterrent, a tax would help ensure that the life of power plants countries is not artificially prolonged and that new ones are clearly seen to be uneconomic. This way, it would implicitly address not only carbon emissions but also air pollution and other violations.

The tax must also apply to Energy Community countries if they do not start to apply CO2 emissions pricing on their own at a level which serves as a real incentive to decarbonise. As these countries have access to the EU energy market, they need to comply with the same environmental standards, state aid rules, and carbon pricing in the energy sector. Failure to do so will distort the market, disadvantaging electricity generators in countries at the edge of the EU who have to face cheaper competition from more polluting plants.

In addition, due to the EU’s increased efforts on climate, for countries planning to join the EU, it would be even harder to align with EU legislation in the future if work is not started on this now.

Bankwatch supports the introduction of a carbon border tax in the electricity sector because it:
- Encourages more countries to take ambitious climate measures
- Can solve the problem of carbon leakage in the electricity sector
- Removes unfair competition from non-compliant and highly polluting plants in countries neighbouring the EU
- Can help to protect local economies by supporting electricity generators adhering to EU rules.
- Fills in the gaps that the EU-ETS cannot fill, regarding trading with non-EU countries
- Circumvents the EU’s failure so far to close legal loopholes in Energy Community countries that encourage new coal mines and power plants.

The proceeds of any such tax must be used for a just and sustainable energy transition, and the tax must also mean an end to free ETS allowances for all sectors.

Carbon leakage is defined in the Inception Impact Assessment (IIA) as the transfer of production and investment to countries with lower climate ambition and/or the replacement of EU products with more carbon intensive ones from outside the EU.

Therefore, the stated focus of the initiative is entirely environmental and is aimed at limiting global emissions. However, another aspect needs to be considered, which is also related to global emissions, but is focused on the issue of competitiveness, and how domestic mitigation measures affect competitiveness and carbon leakage. Addressing competitiveness should ensure that products that have a lower carbon intensity are not disadvantaged in the domestic as well as international markets, resulting in higher emissions.

Consequently, the issue of competitiveness, and ensuring a level playing field between jurisdictions with asymmetrical levels of ambition is another objective that should be considered in finding an approach to dealing with asymmetrical climate change policies.

Border carbon adjustments (BCAs) seek to alleviate the negative effects of uneven (asymmetrical) climate policies and may include imports and/or exempt exports. Ensuring that both these aspects are included in the examination is critical for the effectiveness and credibility of any approach being adopted.

In the same train of thought, it is important that both direct and indirect emissions are included in the examination that the European Commission is proposing.
BCAs have three main objectives:
- Prevent leakage of carbon emissions to jurisdictions with weaker policies;
- Create a level playing field in competitive markets;
- Incentivise trade partners to strengthen their own climate efforts.

While we recognise the possible rationale of the CBA from a climate objective perspective, in our discussion paper and in this feedback we focus more on social justice questions that may arise from a CBA, especially in relation to potential impacts on developing countries. Overall, we believe that the EU should seek to reduce carbon emissions associated with EU imports but other, potentially more effective tools than a CBA, such as import standards regulations, should also be considered alongside or even instead of a CBA.

If and when considering and designing the CBA, the EU should be guided by the following principles: 

1.	Global environmental benefit: a CBA should be designed with global climate, environment and social objectives at its core, and should be flexible and nuanced enough to avoid causing perverse incentives in other countries that ultimately lead to more harm.
2.	Policy Coherence for Development: a CBA should be coherent with development policy objectives and avoid any negative impact on the economies of developing countries, including via flanking measures.
3.	Equity: acknowledging the EU’s climate debt towards developing countries, as early-industrialised countries have already consumed most of the global carbon budget and must undertake steeper emission reductions to keep the planet under 1.5°C of average global warming.
4.	Existing commitments under the Everything But Arms initiative: special approach towards the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), in order to encourage their development, and consider impact on tariff-free access to the EU market where it exists. 
5.	Fairness and progressivity: considerations of progressivity must be applied to both the exporting developing countries as well as importing EU countries, to ensure the CBA does not create an additional, disproportionate burden on low-income households in Europe nor negative impacts on jobs and inequality in developing countries.

Based on our analysis of potential impacts on developing countries, in our discussion paper we conclude that, if the EU does decide to go ahead with a CBA, it must thoroughly consider and take into consideration in the Impact Assessment the following challenges:

●	Is the CBA an effective tool to discourage carbon leakage or high GHGs in countries exporting to the EU? Are there other measures that could be more effective, e.g. import standards regulations? 
●	Is the CBA able to recognise and adjust when other national policies, practices or regulations beyond domestic carbon prices and taxes have led to reduced GHG emissions and benefits to the environment?
●	Finding the right balance between respecting developing countries’ policy space, export needs and the EU’s policy coherence for development principle, and addressing the climate emergency by discouraging fossil fuel extraction and other carbon intensive economic activities in the EU and beyond. 
●	How to ensure that low-income households in Europe are not unfairly and disproportionately penalised by higher prices on essential products? 
●	Can the revenues from the CBA be used in a fair way? 
      o The revenues accumulated in Europe via the CBA when imposed on products imported from developing countries could be transferred back to the countries concerned for their own budgetary goals, in order to strengthen their domestic resource mobilisation for financing of public services such as housing, education, health, environmental protection, or a just transition. 
     o  When a CBA applies to countries that are neither least developed countries nor developing countries, such as non-EU OECD countries, the proceeds could be used for redistribution within Europe to mitigate impacts on low-income households, or alternatively they could be directed to the UN’s Green Climate Fund as additional contributions.

The European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers have since more than 20 years been on the path to develop a more circular tyre and rubber economy, reduce material waste, reduce direct and indirect CO₂ emissions and develop high quality products favouring reduced CO₂ emissions during use. These are just some examples of the actions taken reaching remarkable achievements, inter alia, thanks to the fact that the Tyre industry was included in the list of carbon leakage .

A PARIS AGREEMENT WIT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD MECHANISM
Recognizing that the Paris Agreement objectives have been co-signed by most industrialized countries in the world it is fair to ensure that the EU steps up its effort to influence the carbon footprint of products and services accessing the EU single market from other countries, sometimes, with a less ambitious climate action plan. 

Therefore, European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers looks with interest to the Commission’s intention to establish a mechanism permitting both domestic and foreign market player to equally contribute to the effort of EU to meet the global climate objectives. 

Recognizing the challenges in setting a fair adjustment process ensuring these will encourage third country producers to deliver on their commitment on the Paris Agreement goal, we call upon the Commission to establish a strong dialogue with the EU stakeholders like our sector. This in the aim to develop the most efficient and fair instrument and avoiding establishing  measures that could unintendedly have direct or indirect impacts on our specific sector.

Achieving the common objective of transitioning to carbon-neutral construction relies on ensuring the attractiveness of local production, while promoting innovative low-carbon investments and advanced technologies such as carbon capture use and storage, and creating demand for low carbon building materials and solutions.

Competitive EU manufacturing anchored in the low-carbon transition will only happen if a level-playing field with non-EU importers is ensured with regards to carbon costs. With reduced Historical Activity Level (HAL) and emission factor benchmark, this prerequisite will be even more important during Phase IV of the EU ETS. The expected allocation deficit puts some 40 million tonnes of EU-manufactured clinker at risk of being offshored by 2030 (equivalent to >20% of the EU demand). The import of more carbon-intensive products to meet the demand for construction materials in Europe would slow down the low-carbon transition in the region.

In this context, LafargeHolcim takes the view that the existing EU ETS needs to be complemented by a carbon border adjustment mechanism. It is a necessary measure to maintain a fair competition as the free allocations under ETS phase IV will not be sufficient to enable EU-based manufacturing to compete fairly with non-EU imports that do not have equivalent carbon costs. 

The objective must be for non-EU importers to bear the same CO2 costs as EU domestic producers. As EU ETS phase IV comes into force, free allocations are unlikely to cover the full carbon cost paid by EU manufacturers. 

A carbon border adjustment mechanism should:
- cover that cost difference between the full carbon cost paid by European manufacturers minus the free allocations under EU ETS (free allocations that are awarded to EU producers must be discounted from the carbon costs levied on importers);
- not lead to any changes to the EU ETS, nor impact the EU carbon market / budget;
- be tested and phased-in in parallel with the continuation of EU ETS mechanisms, until it is fully and successfully operational and legally secured.

For the cement sector, we take the view that measuring the CO2 content of imported clinker should be based on the standard CEN EN 19694-31, used by the cement industry to measure and report its CO2 emissions. It forms a globally harmonised methodology for the calculation of CO2 emissions from clinker and cement production. 

In practice, the charge (for the cement sector) could look like as follows:
Carbon import charges (€/t clinker) = (verified emissions of import + associated transport
emissions in kg CO2/t clinker) - (EU ETS clinker benchmark in kg CO2/t clinker * CSRF) multiplied by the carbon price (€/kg CO2).

The carbon price used to calculate the charges must be as close as possible to actual spot
prices, given the significant volatility that currently exists on the carbon market and uncertainties linked to a large list of factors (Brexit, coal plant closures, etc.). The use of past annual averages would more than likely not be representative of the situation in a future transaction.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism must be tested and phased-in in parallel with the continuation of EU ETS mechanisms, until it is fully and successfully operational and legally secured.

The price per-tonne CO2e should be lower at first (ie €15/t) to avoid an immediate shock but rise automatically every year by a set amount (ie €10/t). This works best paired with a newly-created domestic carbon fee using the same price and charged upstream “at the source” to ensure economy-wide coverage. For installations under the ETS this would serve as a floor price.

Benefits include:
+ A level playing field by combining the CBA with an EU-wide price floor. A CBA based (directly or indirectly) on the ETS price would not offer this unless (i) all emissions embodied in domestic goods are also fully covered, (ii) state aid is ended and (iii) importers can bank allowances too. 
+ Certainty. A predictably rising price allows firms to precisely compare investments in decarbonisation against a minimum cost for continued emissions, giving them confidence long-term investments will pay off. Without a clear price path, foreign producers will struggle to estimate how many allowances will be available to them in the future / what floating price they’ll have to pay. So they won’t act until they feel an impact.
+ Minimised administrative burden. Incorporation into the ETS would (i) be challenging for customs officials to manage on a daily basis (as would a floating CBA price linked indirectly to the ETS), (ii) require expanding the allowance supply, which risks causing a shortage or excess and (iii) be complicated for exports.

2) Methodology: Carbon content estimates should be based on global (not EU) benchmarks by default, with importers given the right to provide more specific measurements.

Benefits include:
+ Ambition. EU decarbonisation is farther along than in most regions, so EU benchmarks would be overly generous to importers and encourage carbon leakage (a domestic firm could get “benchmark credit” by shifting production offshore instead of actually decarbonising). 
+ Supply chain transparency. Firms would be incentivised to report / reduce their tertiary emissions, and so better understand their supply chains’ environmental impacts - a goal of the Green Deal.

3) Coverage: The CBA should cover all Energy Intensive Trade Exposed (EITE) goods and be expandable to others where the impact is material.

Benefits include:
+ Elimination of free allowances and state aid. Member States can raise more auction revenues and save on state aid, providing them with additional funds to support their transitions. 
+ Adaptability. Imagine a firm manufacturing cans in the EU with imported aluminium. If the CBA only applies to primary aluminium, the firm could get around it by shifting can manufacturing offshore and importing finished cans instead. That would cause EU job losses and carbon leakage unless the CBA can be adapted.
+ WTO integrity: The EU would not be accused of covering only those EITE goods where it stands to benefit.
+ Revenue. The EU imports more carbon than it exports so a broad CBA would generate funds for the EU budget.
+ Diplomacy. This creates an incentive for trading partners to price carbon.

4) Fairness: The combined measures above would protect jobs and spur EU innovation. However, the CBA and loss of free allowances will increase companies’ costs, which will be passed on to consumers. For ambitious carbon pricing to be politically viable citizens must be protected. The domestic carbon fee’s net revenues should be redistributed as a monthly dividend to all households. 

Benefits include:
+ Polluter pays. Carbon emissions are highly unequal in society. Most people would net benefit from an equal redistribution of carbon fee revenues, especially those with lower incomes.
+ Families receiving a carbon dividend would have extra cash to spend in the economy. And they would see their net benefits increase if they choose to buy low-carbon goods and services.
+ Carbon Fee & Dividend is self-funding, requiring no new budget allocation.

Flat glass manufacturing is an energy intensive activity covered under the EU ETS and the flat glass sector is considered at high risk of carbon leakage. The flat glass sector has embraced the climate neutrality direction provided by the European Green Deal and issued in January 2020 its 2050 vision to maximize its contributions to this societal objective. In particular, the European flat glass sector takes it as its role to produce at a competitive price the materials essential for renovating Europe’s buildings, for supporting the clean mobility transition and for increasing the share of renewable solar energy in Europe. While already providing net carbon-avoidance products, the flat glass sector is looking into ways to massively scale up its contributions to the carbon neutral transition, including by developing novel ways to lower its industrial emissions.

The European flat glass sector agrees that all measures that could potentially reduce industrial emissions globally, while preserving a competitive advantage for EU-made low-carbon industrial goods which are needed to the EU transition towards climate-neutrality, should be carefully analysed before a legislative proposal is tabled. To contribute to the in-depth analysis of the border adjustment mechanism, the flat glass sector wishes to present the following elements for consideration:

The inception mentions in its analysis of the social impacts of inaction that the scenario to be compared to a BAM is “i.e.  increasing the EU climate ambition without any new measures addressing carbon leakage.” To Glass for Europe’s views, the decision-makers would benefit from a comparison of a broader range of scenarios to ensure the proportionality of the new measure (both in EU and WTO legislations). The scenarios could include:
-	Scenario 0: no carbon leakage protection to industry;
-	Scenario 1: continuation of the carbon leakage protection to industry exposed to risk of carbon leakage with free allocations at the level of the benchmark;
-	Scenario 2: introduction of a border adjustment mechanism replacing the free allocations to industry exposed to risk of carbon leakage;
-	Scenario 3: introduction of a border adjustment mechanism with continuation of carbon leakage protection measures under the format of possibly-reformed systems of free allocations 
The three scenarios plus the scenario 0 (no carbon leakage protection to industry) would benefit from additional variables to be considered, such as:
-	Industrial sectors included in the border adjustment mechanism
-	Date of entry into force of the border adjustment mechanism
-	Revision of the 2030 target and different levels of contribution for the EU ETS sectors

In addition to the scenarios, some further elements would be worth considering in the future impact assessment:
-	In the analysis of the effects on the price of consumer products, to pay attention to mechanism such as offer and demand effects in the segments were the demand for industrial goods is expected to increase. This is particularly relevant for the construction sector with the renovation wave announced by the Green Deal;
-	In the analysis of the social and economic impact of the products, to pay attention to the impact on the value-chains (in particular for complex value-chains). If the BAM was to be applied to primary material, a risk assessment of an increase in imports of transformed products should be considered to provide a full picture on its social and economic impact.  
-	Regarding the analysis on the administrative burden, it is necessary to include control measures in third countries since fraudulent declarations are already observed from certain countries.

A well-designed mechanism can be a powerful tool to drive GHG emission reductions globally and at the same time avoid carbon leakage.

The risk of carbon leakage for energy intensive industries in Europe, including refining and petrochemicals, is very real as long as other parts of the world do not catch up with Europe’s climate policies – and there are no signs that the major trading partners relevant for our sectors (USA, Russia, Middle East, …) have any intention to do so.  The current carbon leakage measures (free allowances and compensation of indirect cost) are imperfect and not sustainable in the long run.

A carbon border adjustment mechanism that imposes direct and indirect carbon cost to importers similar to the cost already charged to European manufacturers would restore a level playing field on the European market, provide a stronger incentive for importers to adopt climate policies at home and allow the carbon content of products to be better reflected for the final customer, providing a more efficient and powerful signal for consumption and behavioral changes.

The design of a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism will have to carefully consider the potential deterioration of the competitiveness of both products exported outside the EU and products along the downstream value chain (such as base chemicals, polymers or lubricants for the Refining sector), if the CBA mechanism would apply only to some selected sectors.  Should it fail dealing satisfactorily with exports and downstream products, then separate measures will have to be developed. Providing a level playing field on foreign markets for products exported from European emission intensive industries is not only needed for supporting European industry but may also benefit global reduction efforts.  This is valid for “standard” products that are made by emission efficient European plants with less emissions than their foreign counterparts, but in the future also for new “low carbon products” (for instance synthetic fuels, in particular jet-fuels) that have significantly lower emissions when used.

As the situation may be quite different for various sectors and even within one sector, we recommend that the possibility should be given to a sector or to a sub-sector representing a family of products to be included in a carbon border adjustment mechanism, at the choice of that sector or sub-sector.

A carbon border adjustment mechanism is intended to eventually replace current ETS carbon leakage measures.  However, as the real impact on all economic actors is difficult to predict, we ask for a transition period in which the new mechanism is phased in and free allowances and compensation of indirect cost are phased out in a well-organized manner.

We hope that the discussions on carbon border adjustment will promote international dialogue and contribute to climate action by all major economic players, making itself unneeded after some time.  The ultimate goal should be to include a cost for all GHG emissions, generated either in Europe or elsewhere, in the cost for all products and services globally.

Gas Networks Ireland develops, operates and maintains the natural gas transmission and distribution networks in Ireland and provides gas transportation services to all gas suppliers and shippers in Ireland. 

Ervia welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback on the Inception Impact Assessment for the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Ervia supports measures that will increase the global ambition for emission reductions whilst maintaining competitiveness of EU industry. We fully support moves to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism that will provide a level playing field for Irish (and other EU ) industry. In Ireland, this is of particular importance to industries that utilise our gas network for operation and production. These industries should not be penalised for less expensive, higher carbon intense products imported from outside the EU.

Ervia has a vision for Ireland's gas network to be net zero by 2050. Transitioning to a climate economy will be challenging as a balance between sustainability, security of supply and affordability must be achieved. The gas network will provide a least cost pathway to decarbonise industry and power generation and will support a competitive economy. The European Green Deal and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will be of key importance to the enabling of a competitive and fair economy for all. A successfully applied Mechanism will allow Irish industry to adopt sustainable measures such as use of biomethane, blue and green hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and compete effectively across the EU.

Ervia note the Commission will develop a number of options for the new policy instrument and that different methodological approaches for evaluation are being considered along with the sectors that could be impacted by the Mechanism. The options presented in the Consultation must reflect the balance between the three forces in the energy trilemma. It must also ensure that the sectors are carefully chosen in terms of the highest carbon leakage so that they can continue to operate in a competitive manner.

It will be important that the true level of carbon embedded in imports from outside the EU can be calculated so that an appropriate level of carbon border tax can be applied to them. There is a risk that the level of scrutiny of carbon emissions from product manufactured in the EU will be higher than that applied to products from outside the EU. The methodology or standard applied by the EU to calculate emissions and embedded carbon in imported products will therefore be critical to the success of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. 

Another key consideration is to structure the ETS price at a starting point that allows for the necessary increases to ultimately achieve net zero GHG by 2050.

It helps to prevent employment and market share losses of domestic firms. However, it is crucial to implement full BCA. This means that imports from countries are taxed at the domestic rate, and furthermore, that carbon price expenditures for exports to countries with no comparable carbon price are reimbursed to the domestic firms. This is the only way to fully restore their international competitiveness. I suggest to implement a carbon price in the EU in the form of an upstream carbon tax on all fossil fuels extracted from the earth’s crust within the EU, as well as on those imported from abroad. This is the least bureaucratic way to establish a carbon price that covers all CO2 emissions within the EU, and that correctly reflects the external damages from CO2 emissions. Then BCA should be implemented at the level of the carbon tax. The EU ETS can continue to operate. The carbon tax then effectively serves as a minimum price in the EU ETS, but it covers also all CO2 emissions in sectors not embedded in the EU ETS. BCA would be applied to all imports and exports of fossil fuels and other raw materials. For more complex goods (e.g., final consumer goods), BCA is often too difficult to implement, as the carbon content of these goods may be hard to quantify. However, if the carbon content is sufficiently low, BCA is also not necessary. A simple way to find out if BCA is applicable for certain industries might be to permit domestic firms to request the implementation of BCA for their own sector. If a sufficiently high number of firms (weighted by their market shares) requests BCA (e.g., 50 percent), then the implementation of BCA should be considered for this sector.

We are now working with our members on a more detailed consideration of the potential carbon border adjustment mechanism. At a high level, there is consensus on the following principles:

•	IIGCC also supports full compatibility with WTO rules in order to make such a mechanism workable. This is important from a technical, legal and political perspective. 
•	Linked to this, IIGCC would expect EU policymakers to ensure that any wider implications of the carbon border adjustment mechanism did not result in impacts that could jeopardise the overall environmental integrity of the carbon market. In particular, due consideration should be given to the impact of such an approach on the EU’s international relations, its on-going climate diplomacy work, and its global climate leadership.
•	Finally, any carbon border adjustment mechanism must be implemented in a smooth and efficient manner to avoid any shocks to the EU carbon market, while ensuring continued emissions reductions.

As a group of academics with an interdisciplinary background, including law and economics, we have analysed three main models that could lead to the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism or alternative measures. 

These three models help to highlight the main differences between the available options for the EU: 
•	Under the first model, importers of basic materials would be required to surrender carbon allowances at the level of a product benchmark or, where lower, at the verified level of foreign carbon intensity. In parallel, allocation of free allowances would be phased out.
•	Under the second model, a symmetric adjustment mechanism for exports and imports would be adopted, including refund to exporters for the carbon costs incurred on basic materials embodied in products.
•	Under the third model, the EU ETS would be complemented with a “climate contribution” on materials sold in the European Union (EU) at the product benchmark level related to the carbon intensity of each material. The free allowance allocation regime would then be modified to be directly linked to the volume of material production at the product benchmark level. 

We evaluate, for each of these three models, their (i) legality under EU, WTO and international law, (ii) coherence with EU climate objectives, (iii) effectiveness in carbon leakage prevention, (iv) potential international implications, as well as their (v) administrative complexity and compliance costs. On that basis, we conclude that the third model scores the highest on these evaluation factors.

nl,509416,,,,PUBLISHED,2020-03-23 13:39:10,False,Ares(2020)1350037,"GSV (Groupement de la Sidérurgie — Steel Industry Federation) is the trade association of steel companies producing or processing steel in Belgium. Belgium stands at the sixth place in the EU in the area of steel production, and is even one in area of intolerance in Europe. GSV has 10 member members who directly employ 10.500 employees and directly and indirectly employ 25.000 employees. The 10 sites in Belgium offer a wide range of products ranging from cold rolled steel to hot rolled, galvanised and lacquered steel. It is important to note that these products are 84 % for export and that only 16 % remain within Belgian borders. 

One of the 10 sites in Belgium is ArcelorMittal Gent. It has two blast furnaces and an integrated steel plant, which means that the raw materials (iron ore and coal) are processed into high value finished products intended for the automotive sector and other industrial sectors such as the construction sector, white goods, packaging, etc. All this is done on the same site. This includes ArcelorMittal Gent as one of the most performing steel producers in Europe (and even in the world) in favour of green steel and energy efficiency (and therefore belongs to the ‘benchmark’). Per tonne of steel produced in the world, ArcelorMittal Gent has 1,7 tonnes of CO2, compared with an average of 2,5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of CO produced in the world. In addition, the company is currently investing in breakthrough technologies paving the way towards a climate-neutral steel production (see more on: Http://www.steelanol.eu/en). They do not face these investments and costs and usually produce steel which is much more polluting and cheaper. In order to ensure a level playing field and the competitiveness of the Belgian steel industry, which makes enormous efforts to produce green steel, GSV argues that the creation of an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’ is crucial. 

Please note that this mechanism would in no way replace the existing protective measures against the risk of “carbon leakage”, such as for example the free allocation of emission allowances under the ETS. This free allocation is primarily intended to address the risk of relocation of production, while an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’ is an effective tool to structurally address the embedded emissions in non-EU steel. 

The steel industry is one of the largest emitters of CO2 in the world. This is due to the specific features of the steel production process and in particular to the reduction of iron oxide to iron. The steel industry is therefore facing a huge challenge, which at the same time brings enormous opportunities. CO2 reduction in the steel production process is possible provided the necessary financial means and an adequate regulatory framework are in place. As mentioned above, several new technologies for climate-neutral steel production are currently being launched and unified (e.g. the steelanol project). It is therefore argued that the current protection measures should be maintained until these new breakthrough technologies achieve sufficient market penetration. During this transitional period, it will thus be possible to mobilise the necessary financial resources for these investments and to facilitate the transition towards a climate-neutral steel production without undue shock effects.  

GSV is of the opinion that such an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’ is WTO-compatible, and a legal study indicating the WTO compatibility of such an ‘Carbon Border Adjustment Measure’.",False,,"GSV (Groupement de la Sidérurgie - Staalindustrie Verbond) is de beroepsvereniging van staalondernemingen die in België staal produceren of verwerken. België staat op de zesde plek in de EU op vlak van staalproductie, en is zelfs nummer één op vlak van inoxproductie in Europa. GSV telt 10 aangesloten leden, die rechtstreeks ± 10.500 werknemers en rechtstreeks en onrechtstreeks samen 25.000 personen tewerkstellen. De 10 sites in België bieden een uitgebreid gamma aan producten aan gaande van koudgewalst staal tot warmgewalst, gegalvaniseerd en (voor)gelakt staal. Belangrijk hierbij is om te weten dat deze producten voor 84% bestemd zijn voor export en dat slechts 16% binnen Belgische grenzen blijft. 

Eén van de 10 sites in België is ArcelorMittal Gent. Deze vestiging beschikt over twee hoogovens en is een geïntegreerd staalbedrijf, wat wil zeggen dat de grondstoffen (ijzererts en kolen) verwerkt tot hoogwaardige eindproducten die bestemd zijn voor de automobielsector en andere industriële sectoren zoals de bouwsector, witgoedsector, verpakkingssector… Dit gebeurt allemaal op dezelfde site. Hiermee behoort ArcelorMittal Gent tot een van de meest performante staalproducenten in Europa (en zelfs ter wereld) op vlak van groen staal en energie-efficiëntie (en behoort het dus tot de “benchmark”). Per ton geproduceerd staal stoot ArcelorMittal Gent 1,7 ton CO2 uit ten opzichte van een gemiddelde van 2,5 ton CO2 per ton geproduceerd staat wereldwijd. Het bedrijf investeert daarenboven momenteel in baanbrekende technologieën die de weg naar een klimaatneutrale staalproductie mogelijk maken (lees meer op: http://www.steelanol.eu/en). Buitenlande staalproducenten worden niet met deze investeringen en kosten geconfronteerd en produceren doorgaans staal dat veel vervuilender en goedkoper is. Met het oog op de vrijwaring van een gelijk speelveld en de competitiviteit van de Belgische staalindustrie, die dit enorme inspanningen doet om groen staal te produceren, stelt GSV dat de invoering van een “Carbon Border Adjustment Measure” cruciaal is. 

Merk hierbij op dat dit mechanisme geenszins de bestaande beschermingsmaatregelen tegen het risico van ""carbon leakage"" zou vervangen, zoals bijvoorbeeld de gratis toewijzing van emissierechten onder ETS. Deze gratis toewijzing is immers vooral bedoeld om het risico van verplaatsing van de productie aan te pakken, terwijl een “Carbon Border Adjustment Measure” een effectief instrument is om bij niet EU-staal de ingebedde emissies structureel aan te pakken. 

De staalindustrie behoort tot de grootste uitstoters op vlak van CO2 ter wereld. Dit heeft alles te maken met de specifieke eigenschappen van het staalproductieproces en in het bijzonder met de reductie van ijzeroxide naar ijzer. De staalindustrie staat dus voor een enorme uitdaging, die tegelijk enorme opportuniteiten met zich meebrengt. CO2-reductie in het staalproductieproces is mogelijk mits de noodzakelijke financiële middelen en een adequaat regelgevend kader voorhanden zijn. Zoals hierboven reeds werd aangehaald, worden momenteel diverse nieuwe technologieën voor een klimaatneutrale staalproductie opgestart en geüpscaled (zoals bijvoorbeeld het steelanol-project). Daarom wordt ervoor gepleit om de huidige beschermingsmaatregelen te behouden tot deze nieuwe doorbraaktechnologieën een voldoende marktpenetratie bereiken. Tijdens deze overgangsperiode wordt het aldus mogelijk de nodige financiële middelen voor deze investeringen vrij te maken en de transitie naar een klimaatneutrale staalproductie te faciliteren zonder ongewenste schokeffecten. 

GSV is van mening dat een dergelijke “Carbon Border Adjustment Measure” wel degelijk WTO-compatibel is. In bijlage vindt u een juridische studie die de WTO-compatibiliteit van een dergelijke “Carbon Border Adjustment Measure” aangeeft.

Fortum as a major European utility recognises the need to address the increasing carbon leakage risk for the European industries in the context of higher climate ambition and supports the Commission’s initiative to investigate measures in mitigating carbon leakage and establishing a carbon border adjustment (CBA) mechanism in the EU. The EU has to ensure the competitiveness of European companies exposed to global competition. At the same time, we emphasise that the extension of carbon pricing globally should be the priority and we encourage the EU to continue its international climate diplomacy and working with global partners in raising the global ambition and applying carbon pricing.

However, realizing the fact that currently only 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are subject to some kind of carbon pricing and an extensive global carbon price is still far away, the EU needs to take measures in those sectors where carbon leakage demonstrably exists and where the risk is the highest. In our opinion, any kind of a CBA mechanism should incentivise decarbonisation, promote more ambitious climate policies and enhance carbon pricing in third countries.

Any CBA mechanism will have to comply with World Trade Organisation rules.

Carbon leakage relevant in cross-border power trading

Carbon leakage has traditionally been recognised as a challenge for industrial sectors. However, carbon leakage is also increasingly relevant in cross-border power trading between EU member states and third countries. Currently, 13 EU countries are physically connected with 11 non-EU countries and 33 TWh of electricity was imported to the EU region in 2019. About 2/3 of this was coal-based electricity. Cross-border power trading between EU member states and third countries is expected to increase and potentially result in increasing carbon leakage.

Carbon border adjustment in the power sector could be more straightforward than in industry, because flows of electricity are transparent and the relatively simple production chain allows better tracking of carbon content of the product. As electricity is not subject to free allocation in the EU ETS, carbon border adjustment will not be an overlapping measure.

CBA mechanism in power sector to be based on GoO and EU ETS

Regarding the type of policy instrument for CBA, Fortum prefers an instrument building on existing systems and agreed methodologies. In our opinion, the most suitable instrument for tackling carbon leakage in the power sector would be a guarantee of origin (GoO) system combined with an obligation for the electricity exporter to purchase and surrender EU emission allowances (EUA). Both the GoO and ETS are existing and proven European systems and extending them to power imports would minimize administrative burden in establishing the CBA mechanism. The EU ETS provides an explicit and dynamic carbon price at which the imports can be charged.

Alternatively, carbon border adjustment in the power sector could be imposed in the form of a tariff based on the embedded carbon. A border tariff may be simpler than the obligation to surrender allowances, but the tariff would entail practically no incentive to invest in less emitting power generation in third countries, as the incremental effect on average carbon intensity would likely be too marginal to provide a measurable return.

In order to promote market-based, competitive and transparent solutions, an additional prerequisite should be that all imported electricity is sold through common European market platforms instead of bilateral contracts. This also ensures that the origin of electricity can be reliably traced.

This is because CO2 border compensation charges these products with a price that is also applicable in the EU, in line with the CO2 generated at the EU customs border.

Carbon leakage is a very important issue; we have already seen a move of energy intensive and GHG emissions intensive technologies to the regions with less strict control of emissions. 
 
One of the existing ways to acquire information about product carbon footprint is to perform long, costly and man-hours-intensive life-cycle analysis, which involves third-party verification and confirmation of calculations, which are then used as product industry averages numbers. 
 
Another approach is self-imposed producer sustainability reporting, which requires trust that reporting was done correctly. Usually the trust question is also solved through third-party verification, which can be very expensive for producers and is often only affordable for big corporations, which diminishes the concept of free competitiveness and makes SME uncompetitive.
 
There are blockchain based solutions appearing at the market as digital alternatives for materials verification and products flow traceability. These can currently only solve the question of materials origin and supply chain traceability but the first startups are adding carbon footprint tracking along the entire value chain of products.
 
The solution for fair carbon traceability and carbon border needs to include the possibility of tracing the eco-footprint of each product per each producer, and not rely on a generic “industry average”. 
 
Even in countries where carbon regulation is not imposed, there are producers who are installing renewable energy sourcing, using fuels with low carbon footprint, etc. 
 
As an example: there could be two almost identical old steel plants in a country outside the EU, where Plant A is investing in renewable energy generation, CCU, low emissions trucks, and Plant B continues with old-style production. If an EU carbon border mechanism uses an average generic number for the carbon footprint of steel from this country, this will completely disadvantage eco-friendly investments. Forcing such producers to hire third-party verification can lead to unnecessary expenses and products price increase.  
 
The solution comes through a blockchain based system that can automatically collect all necessary real-time production information through integrated industrial sensors installed at production site and with complete audit proof documentation of all transactions along sourcing, production and logistics including the respective CO2 or GHG footprint.
 
Only the automatic traceability of ‘carbon footprint per product’ can solve the issue without adding a new layer of costly and often unreliable auditing processes.

A border tax must be built on the ETS; that goes for the level of the levy and for use of a possible link with ETS and CO2 markets in other countries. In the preparation of a carbon border tax, in my opinion, the following 6 principles should also apply.
1.	No carbon border tax application for trading partners with its own ETS or CO2 tax, such as Canada, South Korea, New Zealand and Mexico. A list of these can simply be drawn up. The question then is what one does with imports from California, because that has a similar ETS system, which means for the producer CO2 costs. Such a list of countries is a good step for setting up a “Carbon Club“, a concept developed by Environmental Defense Fund. I am thinking of a ‘GATT’-like trade agreement, where products can be traded among themselves, without CO2 tax and in which countries. And in such a club, companies are allowed to use each other’s emission rights or credits to meet CO2 requirements. The club can then apply a joint carbon border tax on imports from third countries. A carbon club of countries with carbon pricing systems is also good alternative if the Climate Summit in November in Glasgow fails to reach common rules on international CO2 trading.

2.	Determining the basis of the levy is not yet easy. The EU must request a carbon label for each product (x grams of CO2 per washing machine). The question remains to what extent the LCA and indirect emissions should be taken into account, where the EU ETS itself does not. The tax can also be levied on the ‘avoidable’ emissions just like the upcoming Dutch tax designed for the industry, additional to ETS. That may be fair, but it does not yet provide a level playing field for the EU’s CO2 costs compared to the competition. 

3.	Here, the question arises as to whether, when introducing a carbon border tax, the EU should stop allocating free allowances at all and go for 100 percent auction. In doing so, it is assumed that the border tax already guarantees level playing field. The European Commission will need to investigate how quickly the percentage of allowances to be auctioned can be increased for industry and whether costs can be passed through. The industry will applaud a carbon border tax but against 100% auction. Auction is also not necessary for achieving the CO2 targets, with a decreasing budget, but in the long term there will also be no room for a CO2 budget.

4.	For the level of the tax the best is to start low, say 5 euros per tonne to help acceptance and to star having at least a a price signal. A high levy of say 26 euros, like the current EU ETS price is of course more stimulating to reduce the CO2 emissions of the exporter. IF the EU will apply a 100% auction, than the border tax should be at least equal to the auction price.

5.	The revenues of the tax should be spent smart. It is suggested that the European Commission should use the revenue to purchase EU allowances. This is not wise, as this leads to a higher CO2 price for the own industry than is necessary to achieve the CO2 target. And it frustrates the operation of the Market Stability Reserve, which could then bring extra permits to the market. I would rather like to divide the revenue destination as follows,
1.	partly to the companies that export goods, with higher CO2 costs than in the country of destination,
2.	partly to innovation funds
3.	partly to the country of importation.

6.	Countries exporting goods to the EU do not have to pay the carbon border tax if they surrender commensurate allowances or carbon credits in line with the carbon label. The EU can use these credits to help achieve sharper CO2 targets, as en the same CO2 reductions are achieved as if production had taken place in the EU. And the exporter then incurs comparable CO2 costs at the border.",,,withinfo,other,micro,closed,7587254,

It is fortunate that Europe is so big that it can solve the supply of products on its internal markets even if the level of imports decreases due to customs duties.
