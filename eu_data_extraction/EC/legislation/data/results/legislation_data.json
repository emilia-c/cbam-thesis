That strategy aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, where there are no net emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of greenhouse gases (‘greenhouse gas emissions’) at the latest by 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from the use of resources. The European Green Deal aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and to protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, that transformation must be just and inclusive, leaving no one behind. The Commission also announced in its communication of 12 May 2021 entitled ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All, EU Action Plan: Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil’ the promotion of relevant instruments and incentives to better implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle set out in Article 191(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and thus complete the phasing out of ‘pollution for free’ with a view to maximising synergies between decarbonisation and the zero-pollution ambition.\n(2) The Paris Agreement (‘), adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the ‘Paris Agreement’), entered into force on 4 November 2016. The Parties to the Paris Agreement have agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Under the Glasgow Climate Pact, adopted on 13 November 2021, the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, also recognised that limiting the increase in the global average temperature to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, and committed to strengthening the 2030 targets by the end of 2022 to close the ambition gap.\n(’) OJ C 152, 6.4.2022, p. 181.\n() OJ C 301, 5.8.2022, p. 116.\n() Position of the European Parliament of 18 April 2023 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of\n25 April 2023.\n(! OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, p. 4.\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(3)\nTackling climate and other environment-related challenges and reaching the objectives of the Paris Agreement are at the core of the European Green Deal. The value of the European Green Deal has only grown in light of the very severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and economic well-being of the Union’s citizens.\n(4) The Union committed to reducing the Union’s economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030, as set out in the submission to the UNFCCC on behalf of the European Union and its Member States on the update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and its Member States.\n(5) Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*) has enshrined in legislation the objective of economy-wide climate neutrality at the latest by 2050. That Regulation also establishes a binding Union domestic reduction target for net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030.\n(6) The Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of 2018 on the impacts of global temperature increases of 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways provides a strong scientific basis for tackling climate change and illustrates the need to step up climate action. That report confirms that, in order to reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events, greenhouse gas emissions need to be urgently reduced, and that climate change needs to be limited to a global temperature increase of 1,5 °C. Moreover, if mitigation pathways, consistent with limiting global warming to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels, are not rapidly activated, much more expensive and complex adaptation measures will have to be taken to avoid the impacts of higher levels of global warming. The contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC entitled ‘Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis’ recalls that climate change is already affecting every region on Earth and projects that in the coming decades climate change will increase in all regions. That report stresses that, unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1,5 °C or even 2 °C will be beyond reach.\n(7) The Union has been pursuing an ambitious policy on climate action and has put in place a regulatory framework to achieve its 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The legislation implementing that target consists, inter alia, of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (°), which establishes a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (EU ETS’) and delivers harmonised pricing of greenhouse gas emissions at Union level for energy-intensive sectors and subsectors, of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council (’), which introduces national targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*), which requires Member States to compensate greenhouse gas emissions from land use with the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n(8) While the Union has substantially reduced its domestic greenhouse gas emissions, the greenhouse gas emissions embedded in imports to the Union have been increasing, thereby undermining the Union’s efforts to reduce its global greenhouse gas emissions footprint. The Union has a responsibility to continue playing a leading role in global climate action.\n() Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (European Climate Law’) (OJ L 243, 9.7.2021, 1\n(*) 200 3/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).\nDirective\n(’) Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 26).\n(*) Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 1).\nL 130/53\nL 130/54\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(9)\nAs long as a significant number of the Union’s international partners have policy approaches that do not achieve the same level of climate ambition, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs if, for reasons of costs related to climate policies, businesses in certain industry sectors or subsectors transfer production to other countries or imports from those countries replace equivalent products that are less intensive in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Such situations could lead to an increase in the total global emissions, thus jeopardising the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that is urgently needed if the world is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. As the Union increases its climate ambition, that risk of carbon leakage could undermine the effectiveness of Union emission reduction policies.\n(10) The initiative for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM)) is part of the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package. The CBAM is to serve as an essential element of the Union’s toolbox for meeting the objective of a climate-neutral Union at the latest by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement by addressing the risk of carbon leakage that results from the Union’s increased climate ambition. The CBAM is expected to also contribute to promoting decarbonisation in third countries.\n(11) Existing mechanisms for addressing the risk of carbon leakage in sectors or subsectors where such risk exists consist of the transitional free allocation of EU ETS allowances and financial measures to compensate for indirect emission costs incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices. Those mechanisms are set out in Article 10a(6) and Article 10b of Directive 2003/87/EC, respectively. The free allocation of EU ETS allowances at the level of best performers has been a policy instrument for certain industrial sectors to address the risk of carbon leakage. However, compared to full auctioning, such free allocation weakens the price signal that the system provides and thus affects the incentives for investment into further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n(12) The CBAM seeks to replace those existing mechanisms by addressing the risk of carbon leakage in a different way, namely by ensuring equivalent carbon pricing for imports and domestic products. To ensure a gradual transition from the current system of free allowances to the CBAM, the CBAM should be progressively phased in while free allowances in sectors covered by the CBAM are phased out. The combined and transitional application of EU ETS allowances allocated free of charge and of the CBAM should in no case result in more favourable treatment for Union goods compared to goods imported into the customs territory of the Union.\n(13) The carbon price is rising, and companies need long-term visibility, predictability and legal certainty to make their decisions on investment in the decarbonisation of industrial processes. Therefore, in order to strengthen the legal framework for fighting carbon leakage, a clear pathway for gradual further extension of the scope of the CBAM to products, sectors and subsectors at risk of carbon leakage should be established.\n(14) While the objective of the CBAM is to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, this Regulation would also encourage producers from third countries to use technologies that are more efficient in reducing greenhouse gases so that fewer emissions are generated. For that reason, the CBAM is expected to effectively support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in third countries.\n(15) As an instrument to prevent carbon leakage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the CBAM should ensure that imported products are subject to a regulatory system that applies carbon costs equivalent to those borne under the EU ETS, resulting in a carbon price that is equivalent for imports and domestic products. The CBAM is a climate measure which should support the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the risk of carbon leakage, while ensuring compatibility with World Trade Organization law.\n16.5.2023\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(16) This Regulation should apply to goods imported into the customs territory of the Union from third countries, except where their production has already been subject to the EU ETS through its application to third countries or territories or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.\n(17) With a view to ensuring that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is continuously accompanied by economic and social cohesion, account should be taken, upon future revision of this Regulation, of the special characteristics and constraints of the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU as well as of island States which are part of the customs territory of the Union, without undermining the integrity and coherence of the Union legal order, including the internal market and common policies.\n(18) With a view to preventing the risk of carbon leakage in offshore installations, this Regulation should apply to goods, or processed products from those goods resulting from an inward processing procedure, that are brought to an artificial island, a fixed or floating structure, or any other structure on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State where that continental shelf or exclusive economic zone is adjacent to the customs territory of the Union. Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down detailed conditions for the application of the CBAM to such goods.\n(19) The greenhouse gas emissions that should be subject to the CBAM should correspond to those greenhouse gas emissions covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, namely carbon dioxide (‘CO,’) as well as, where relevant, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. The CBAM should initially apply to direct emissions of those greenhouse gases from the time of production of goods until the import of those goods into the customs territory of the Union, mirroring the scope of the EU ETS to ensure coherence. The CBAM should also apply to indirect emissions. Those indirect emissions are the emissions arising from the generation of electricity used to produce the goods to which this Regulation applies. The inclusion of indirect emissions would further enhance the environmental effectiveness of the CBAM and its ambition to contribute to fighting climate change. Indirect emissions should, however, not be taken into account initially for the goods in respect of which financial measures apply in the Union that compensate for indirect emissions costs incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices. Those goods are identified in Annex II to this Regulation. Future revisions of the EU ETS in Directive 2003/87/EC and, in particular, revisions of the compensation measures of the indirect costs should be appropriately reflected as regards the scope of application of the CBAM. During the transitional period, data should be collected for the purpose of further specifying the methodology for the calculation of indirect emissions. That methodology should take into account the quantity of electricity used for the production of the goods listed in Annex I to this Regulation, as well as the country of origin, generation source, and the emission factors related to that electricity. The specific methodology should be further specified in order to achieve the most appropriate way to prevent carbon leakage and ensure the environmental integrity of the CBAM.\n(20) The EU ETS and the CBAM share a common objective of pricing greenhouse gas emissions embedded in the same sectors and goods through the use of specific allowances or certificates. Both systems have a regulatory nature and are justified by the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the binding environmental target under Union law, set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, to reduce the Union’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030 and the objective to reach economy-wide climate neutrality at the latest by 2050.\n(21) While the EU ETS sets the total number of allowances issued (the ‘cap’) on the greenhouse gas emissions from activities within its scope and allows trading of allowances (the ‘cap and trade system’), the CBAM should not establish quantitative limits on imports, so that trade flows are not restricted. Moreover, while the EU ETS applies to installations in the Union, the CBAM should apply to certain goods imported into the customs territory of the Union.\n(22) The CBAM system has some specific features when compared to the EU ETS, including with respect to the calculation of the price of CBAM certificates, the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and their period of validity. Those features are due to the need to preserve the effectiveness of the CBAM as a measure to prevent carbon leakage over time. They also ensure that the management of the CBAM system is not excessively burdensome, both in terms\nL 130/55\nL 130/56\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nof obligations imposed on operators and administrative resources, while at the same time preserving a level of flexibility available to operators equivalent to that under the EU ETS. Ensuring such a balance is of particular importance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) concerned.\n(23) In order to preserve its effectiveness as a measure to prevent carbon leakage, the CBAM needs to reflect closely the EU ETS price. While on the EU ETS market the price of allowances released onto the market is determined through auctions, the price of CBAM certificates should reasonably reflect the price of such auctions through averages calculated on a weekly basis. Such weekly average prices reflect closely the price fluctuations of the EU ETS and allow a reasonable margin for importers to take advantage of the price changes of the EU ETS while also ensuring that the system remains manageable for administrative authorities.\n(24) Under the EU ETS, the cap determines the supply of emission allowances and provides certainty about maximum emissions of greenhouse gases. The carbon price is determined by the balance of that supply against the market demand. Scarcity is necessary for there to be a price incentive. This Regulation is not intended to impose a cap on the number of CBAM certificates available to importers; if importers were able to carry forward and trade CBAM certificates, that ability could have resulted in situations where the price for CBAM certificates would no longer reflect the evolution of the price in the EU ETS. Such a situation would weaken the incentive for decarbonisation, favouring carbon leakage and impairing the overarching climate objective of the CBAM. It could also result in different prices for operators from different countries. The limits on the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and to carry them forward are therefore justified by the need to avoid undermining the effectiveness and climate objective of the CBAM and to ensure even-handed treatment of operators from different countries. However, in order to preserve the possibility for importers to optimise their costs, this Regulation should provide for a system where authorities can repurchase a certain amount of excess certificates from importers. Such amount should be set at a level which allows a reasonable margin for importers to leverage their costs over the period of validity of the certificates while preserving the overall price transmission effect, ensuring that the environmental objective of the CBAM is preserved.\n(25) Given that the CBAM would apply to imports of goods into the customs territory of the Union rather than to installations, certain adaptations and simplifications would also need to apply in the CBAM. One such simplification should be the introduction of a simple and accessible declarative system whereby importers report the total verified greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods imported in a given calendar year. A different timing compared to the compliance cycle of the EU ETS should also be applied to avoid any potential bottleneck that might result from obligations for accredited verifiers under this Regulation and Directive 2003/87/EC.\n(26) Member States should impose penalties for infringements of this Regulation and ensure that such penalties are enforced. More specifically, the penalty amount for the failure of an authorised CBAM declarant to surrender CBAM certificates should be identical to the amount pursuant to Article 16(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. However, where the goods have been introduced into the Union by a person other than an authorised CBAM declarant without complying with the obligations under this Regulation, the amount of those penalties should be higher in order to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, also taking into account the fact that such person is not obliged to surrender CBAM certificates. The imposition of penalties under this Regulation is without prejudice to penalties that may be imposed under Union or national law for the infringement of other relevant obligations, in particular those related to customs rules.\n(27) While the EU ETS applies to certain production processes and activities, the CBAM should target the corresponding imports of goods. That requires clearly identifying imported goods by means of their classification in the Combined Nomenclature (‘CN’) set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (°) and linking them to embedded emissions.\n(’) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1).\n16.5.2023\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(28) The goods or processed products covered by the CBAM should reflect the activities covered by the EU ETS as that system is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria linked to the environmental objective of Directive 2003/87/EC and is the most comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions regulatory system in the Union.\n(29) Defining the scope of the CBAM in a way that reflects the activities covered by the EU ETS would also contribute to ensuring that imported products are granted a treatment that is not less favourable than that accorded to like products of domestic origin.\n(30) Whilst the ultimate objective of the CBAM is one of broad product coverage, it would be prudent to start with a selected number of sectors with relatively homogeneous goods where there is a risk of carbon leakage. Union sectors deemed to be at risk of carbon leakage are listed in Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/708 (*’).\n(31) The goods, to which this Regulation should apply, should be selected after careful analysis of their relevance in terms of cumulated greenhouse gas emissions and risk of carbon leakage in the corresponding EU ETS sectors, while limiting complexity and administrative burden on the operators concerned. In particular, the selection should take into account basic materials and basic products covered by the EU ETS with the objective of ensuring that emissions embedded in emission-intensive products imported into the Union are subject to a carbon price that is equivalent to that applied to Union products, and of mitigating the risk of carbon leakage. The relevant criteria to narrow the selection should be: first, relevance of sectors in terms of emissions, namely whether the sector is one of the largest ageregate emitters of greenhouse gas emissions; second, the sector's exposure to significant risk of carbon leakage, as defined pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC; and third, the need to balance broad product coverage in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, while limiting complexity and administrative burden.\n(32) The use of the first criterion would allow the listing of the following industrial sectors in terms of cumulated emissions: iron and steel, refineries, cement, aluminium, organic basic chemicals, hydrogen and fertilisers.\n(33) Certain sectors listed in Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/708 should not, however, be addressed in this Regulation at this stage, due to their particular characteristics.\n(34) In particular, organic chemicals should not be included in the scope of this Regulation due to technical limitations that at the time of the adoption of this Regulation do not allow to define clearly the embedded emissions of such imported goods. For those goods the applicable benchmark under the EU ETS is a basic parameter, which does not allow for an unambiguous allocation of emissions embedded in individual imported goods. A more targeted allocation to organic chemicals requires more data and analysis.\n(35) Similar technical constraints apply to refinery products, for which it is not possible to unambiguously assign greenhouse gas emissions to individual output products. At the same time, the relevant benchmark in the EU ETS does not directly relate to specific products, such as petrol, diesel or kerosene, but to all refinery output.\n(36) Aluminium products should be included in the CBAM as they are highly exposed to carbon leakage. Moreover, in several industrial applications they are in direct competition with steel products because of characteristics which closely resemble those of steel products.\n(37) At the time of the adoption of this Regulation, imports of hydrogen into the Union are relatively low. However, that situation is expected to change significantly in the coming years as the Union’s ‘Fit for 55’ package promotes the use of renewable hydrogen. For the decarbonisation of industry as a whole, the demand for renewable hydrogen will increase, and consequently lead to non-integrated production processes in downstream products where hydrogen is a precursor. The inclusion of hydrogen in the scope of the CBAM is the appropriate means to further foster the decarbonisation of hydrogen.\n() Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/708 of 15 February 2019 supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the determination of sectors and subsectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage for the period 2021 to 2030 (OJ L 120, 8.5.2019, p. 20).\nL 130/57\nL 130/58\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(38) Similarly, certain products should be included in the scope of the CBAM despite their low level of embedded emissions occurring during their production process, as their exclusion would increase the likelihood of circumventing the inclusion of steel products in the CBAM by modifying the pattern of trade towards downstream products.\n(39) Conversely, this Regulation should not initially apply to certain products the production of which does not entail meaningful emissions such as ferrous scrap, some ferro-alloys and certain fertilisers.\n(40) The importation of electricity should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as that sector is responsible for 30 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. The Union’s increased climate ambition would widen the gap in carbon costs between electricity production within the Union and third countries. That gap, combined with the progress in connecting the Union electricity grid to that of its neighbours, would increase the risk of carbon leakage due to the increase in imports of electricity, a significant part of which is produced by coal-fired power plants.\n(41) In order to avoid excessive administrative burden as regards competent national administrations and importers, it is appropriate to specify the limited cases in which the obligations under this Regulation should not apply. That de minimis provision, however, is without prejudice to a continued application of the provisions under Union or national law that are necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation as well as, in particular, with customs legislation, including the prevention of fraud.\n(42) As importers of goods covered by this Regulation should not have to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation at the time of importation, specific administrative measures should be applied to ensure that such obligations are fulfilled at a later stage. Therefore, importers should only be entitled to import goods that are subject to this Regulation after they have been granted an authorisation by competent authorities.\n(43) The customs authorities should not allow the importation of goods by any person other than an authorised CBAM declarant. In accordance with Articles 46 and 48 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (!'), the customs authorities are entitled to carry out checks on the goods, including with respect to the identification of the authorised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the country of origin of the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks relating to the CBAM in the establishment of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.\n(44) During a transitional period, the customs authorities should inform customs declarants of the obligation to report information, so as to contribute to the gathering of information as well as to awareness on the need to request the status of authorised CBAM declarants where applicable. Such information should be communicated by the customs authorities in an appropriate manner to ensure that customs declarants are made aware of such obligation.\n(45) The CBAM should be based on a declarative system in which an authorised CBAM declarant, who could represent more than one importer, would submit annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported into the customs territory of the Union and would surrender the number of CBAM certificates which correspond to those declared emissions. The first CBAM declaration, in respect of the calendar year 2026, should be submitted by 31 May 2027.\n(46) An authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions.\n() Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).\n16.5.2023\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(47) The declared embedded emissions should be verified by a person accredited by a national accreditation body appointed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council ('?) or pursuant to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 (').\n(48) The CBAM should allow operators of production installations in third countries to register in the CBAM registry and to make their verified embedded emissions from production of goods available to authorised CBAM declarants. An operator should be able to choose that its name, address and contact information in the CBAM registry are not made accessible to the public.\n(49) CBAM certificates would differ from EU ETS allowances for which daily auctioning is an essential feature. The need to set a clear price for CBAM certificates would make daily publication excessively burdensome and confusing for operators, as daily prices risk becoming obsolete upon publication. Thus, the publication of CBAM prices on a weekly basis would more accurately reflect the pricing trend of EU ETS allowances released onto the market and pursue the same climate objective. The calculation of the price of CBAM certificates should therefore be set on the basis of a longer timeframe, namely on a weekly basis, than on the timeframe established by the EU ETS, namely on a daily basis. The Commission should be tasked with calculating and publishing that average price.\n(50) In order to give authorised CBAM declarants flexibility in complying with their obligations under this Regulation and allow them to benefit from fluctuations in the price of EU ETS allowances, CBAM certificates should be valid for a limited period of time from the date of their purchase. The authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to re-sell a portion of the certificates bought in excess. With a view to surrendering CBAM certificates, the authorised CBAM declarant should accumulate the number of certificates required during the year which corresponds with the thresholds set at the end of each quarter.\n(51) The physical characteristics of electricity as a product justify a slightly different design within the CBAM as compared to other goods. Default values should be used under clearly specified conditions, and it should be possible for authorised CBAM declarants to claim the calculation of their obligations under this Regulation based on actual emissions. Electricity trade is different from trade in other goods, in particular because it is traded through interconnected electricity grids, using power exchanges and specific forms of trading. Market coupling is a densely regulated form of electricity trade which enables the aggregation of bids and offers across the Union.\n(52) To avoid the risk of circumvention and improve the traceability of actual CO, emissions from import of electricity and its use in goods, the calculation of actual emissions should only be permitted under certain strict conditions. In particular, it should be necessary to demonstrate a firm nomination of the allocated interconnection capacity and that there is a direct contractual relation between the purchaser and the producer of the renewable electricity, or between the purchaser and the producer of electricity having lower than default value emissions.\n(53) To reduce the risk of carbon leakage, the Commission should take action to address practices of circumvention. The Commission should evaluate the risk of such circumvention in all sectors to which this Regulation applies.\n(54) Contracting Parties to the Treaty establishing the Energy Community concluded by Council Decision 2006/500/EC (') and, Parties to Association Agreements, including Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas, are committed to decarbonisation processes that should eventually result in the adoption of carbon pricing mechanisms similar or equivalent to the EU ETS or in their participation in the EU ETS.\n() Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30).\n(”) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 of 19 December 2018 on the verification of data and on the accreditation of verifiers pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 334, 31.12.2018, p. 94). (*) Council Decision 2006/500/EC of 29 May 2006 on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty\n(OJ L 198, 20.7.2006, p. 15).\nL 130/59\nL 130/60\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(55) The integration of third countries into the Union electricity market is an important factor for those countries to accelerate their transition to energy systems with high shares of renewable energies. Market coupling for electricity, as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 ('), enables third countries to better integrate electricity from renewable energies into the electricity market, to exchange such electricity in an efficient manner within a wider area, balancing supply and demand with the larger Union market, and to reduce the CO, emission intensity of their electricity generation. Integration of third countries into the Union electricity market also contributes to the security of electricity supplies in those countries and in the neighbouring Member States.\n(56) Once the electricity markets of third countries are closely integrated into that of the Union through market coupling, technical solutions should be found to ensure the application of the CBAM to electricity exported from those countries into the customs territory of the Union. If technical solutions cannot be found, third countries whose markets are coupled with that of the Union should benefit from a time-limited exemption from the CBAM until 2030 with regard solely to the export of electricity, provided that certain conditions are met. Those third countries should, however, develop a roadmap and commit to implementing a carbon pricing mechanism providing for a price that is equivalent to the EU ETS, and should commit to achieving carbon neutrality at the latest by 2050 as well as to align with Union legislation in the areas of environment, climate, competition and energy. Such exemption should be withdrawn at any time if there are reasons to believe that the country in question does not fulfil its commitments or if it has not adopted by 2030 an emissions trading system equivalent to the EU ETS.\n(57) Transitional provisions should apply for a limited period of time. For that purpose, the CBAM should apply without financial adjustment, with the objective of facilitating its smooth roll-out, thereby reducing the risk of disruptive impacts on trade. Importers should have to report on a quarterly basis the embedded emissions in goods imported during the previous quarter of the calendar year, setting out direct and indirect emissions as well as any carbon price effectively paid abroad. The last CBAM report, which is the report to be submitted for the last quarter of 2025, should be submitted by 31 January 2026.\n(58) To facilitate and ensure a proper functioning of the CBAM, the Commission should provide support to the competent authorities in carrying out their functions and duties under this Regulation. The Commission should coordinate, issue guidelines and support the exchange of best practices.\n(59) In order to apply this Regulation in a cost-efficient way, the Commission should manage the CBAM registry containing data on the authorised CBAM declarants, operators and installations in third countries.\n(60) A common central platform should be established for the sale and repurchase of CBAM certificates. With a view to overseeing the transactions on the common central platform, the Commission should facilitate the exchange of information and the cooperation between competent authorities, as well as between those authorities and the Commission. Furthermore, a rapid flow of information between the common central platform and the CBAM registry should be established.\n(61) To contribute to the effective application of this Regulation, the Commission should carry out risk-based controls and should review the content of CBAM declarations accordingly.\n(62) In order to further enable a uniform application of this Regulation, the Commission should, as a preliminary input, make available to the competent authorities its own calculations regarding the CBAM certificates to be surrendered, on the basis of its review of the CBAM declarations. Such preliminary input should be provided for indicative purposes only and without prejudice to the definitive calculation to be made by the competent authority. In particular, no right of appeal or other remedial measure should be possible against such preliminary input made by the Commission.\n() Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management (OJ L 197, 25.7.2015, p. 24).\n16.5.2023\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(63) Member States should also be able to carry out reviews of individual CBAM declarations for enforcement purposes. The conclusions of the reviews of individual CBAM declarations should be shared with the Commission. Those conclusions should also be made available to other competent authorities via the CBAM registry.\n(64) Member States should be responsible for correctly establishing and collecting revenues arising from the application of this Regulation.\n(65) The Commission should regularly evaluate the application of this Regulation and report to the European Parliament and to the Council. Those reports should in particular focus on possibilities to enhance climate actions towards reaching the objective of a climate-neutral Union at the latest by 2050. The Commission should, as part of that reporting, collect the information necessary with a view to the further extension of the scope of this Regulation to embedded indirect emissions in the goods listed in Annex II as soon as possible, as well as to other goods and services that could be at risk of carbon leakage, such as downstream products, and to developing methods of calculating embedded emissions based on the environmental footprint methods, as set out in Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU ('°). Those reports should also contain an assessment of the impact of the CBAM on carbon leakage, including in relation to exports, and its economic, social and territorial impact throughout the Union, taking into account also the special characteristics and constraints of outermost regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU and of island States which are part of the customs territory of the Union.\n(66) Practices of circumvention of this Regulation should be monitored and addressed by the Commission, including where operators could slightly modify their goods without altering their essential characteristics, or artificially split shipments, in order to avoid the obligations under this Regulation. Situations where goods would be sent to a third country or region prior to their importation to the Union market, with the aim of avoiding the obligations under this Regulation, or where operators in third countries would export their less greenhouse gas emissions intensive products to the Union and keep their more greenhouse gas emissions intensive products for other markets, or reorganisation by exporters or producers of their patterns and channels of sale and production, or any other kinds of dual production and dual sale practices, with the aim of avoiding the obligations under this Regulation, should also be monitored.\n(67) In full respect of the principles set out in this Regulation, work on extending the scope of this Regulation should have the aim of including, by 2030, all the sectors covered by Directive 2003/87/EC. Therefore, when reviewing and evaluating the application of this Regulation, the Commission should maintain a reference to this timeline, and give priority to including within the scope of this Regulation greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods that are most exposed to carbon leakage and that are most carbon intensive, as well as in downstream products that contain a significant share of at least one of the goods within the scope of this Regulation. Should the Commission not submit a legislative proposal for such an extension, by 2030, of the scope of this Regulation, it should inform the European Parliament and the Council of the reasons and take the necessary steps towards achieving the objective of including, as soon as possible, all the sectors covered by Directive 2003/87/EC.\n(68) The Commission should also present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of this Regulation two years from the end of the transitional period, and every two years thereafter. The timing for the submission of the reports should follow the timetables on the functioning of the carbon market pursuant to Article 10(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The reports should contain an assessment of the impacts of the CBAM.\n(69) In order to allow for a rapid and effective response to unforeseeable, exceptional and unprovoked circumstances that have destructive consequences on the economic and industrial infrastructure of one or more third countries subject to the CBAM, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal, as appropriate, amending this Regulation. Such a legislative proposal should set out the measures that are most appropriate in light of the circumstances that the third country or countries are facing, while preserving the objectives of this Regulation. Those measures should be limited in time.\n(') Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU of 9 April 2013 on the use of common methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (OJ L 124, 4.5.2013, p. 1).\nL 130/61\nL 130/62\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(70) A dialogue with third countries should continue and there should be space for cooperation and solutions that could inform the specific choices to be made on the details of the CBAM during its implementation, in particular during the transitional period.\n(71) The Commission should strive to engage in an even-handed manner and in line with the international obligations of the Union with the third countries whose trade to the Union is affected by this Regulation, in order to explore the possibility for dialogue and cooperation regarding the implementation of specific elements of the CBAM. The Commission should also explore the possibility of concluding agreements that take into account the carbon pricing mechanism of third countries. The Union should provide technical assistance for those purposes to developing countries and to least developed countries as identified by the United Nations (LDCs).\n(72) The establishment of the CBAM calls for the development of bilateral, multilateral and international cooperation with third countries. For that purpose, a forum of countries with carbon pricing instruments or other comparable instruments (‘Climate Club’) should be set up, in order to promote the implementation of ambitious climate policies in all countries and pave the way for a global carbon pricing framework. The Climate Club should be open, voluntary, non-exclusive and directed in particular at aiming for high climate ambition in line with the Paris Agreement. The Climate Club could function under the auspices of a multilateral international organisation and should facilitate the comparison and, where appropriate, coordination of relevant measures with an impact on emission reduction. The Climate Club should also support the comparability of relevant climate measures by ensuring the quality of climate monitoring, reporting and verification among its members and providing means for engagement and transparency between the Union and its trade partners.\n(73) In order to further support the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement in third countries, it is desirable that the Union continue to provide financial support through the Union budget towards climate mitigation and adaptation in LDCs, including in their efforts towards the decarbonisation and transformation of their manufacturing industries. That Union support should also contribute to facilitating the adaptation of the industries concerned to the new regulatory requirements stemming from this Regulation.\n(74) As the CBAM aims to encourage cleaner production, the Union is committed to working with and supporting low and middle-income third countries towards the decarbonisation of their manufacturing industries as part of the external dimension of the European Green Deal and in line with the Paris Agreement. The Union should continue to support those countries through the Union budget, especially LDCs, in order to contribute to ensuring their adaptation to the obligations under this Regulation. The Union should also continue to support climate mitigation and adaptation in those countries, including in their efforts towards the decarbonisation and transformation of their manufacturing industries, within the ceiling of the multi-annual financial framework and the financial support provided by the Union to international climate finance. The Union is working towards introducing a new own resource based on the revenues generated by the sale of CBAM certificates.\n(75) This Regulation is without prejudice to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (:’) and (EU) 2018/1725 (') of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n(76) In the interest of efficiency, Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 (!*) should apply mutatis mutandis to this Regulation.\n() Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).\n(*) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).\n(”) Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (OJ L 82, 22.3.1997, p. 1).\n16.5.2023\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 130/63\n(77) In order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of:\nsupplementing this Regulation by laying down requirements and procedures for third countries or territories\nthat have been removed from the list in point 2 of Annex III, to ensure the application of this Regulation to\nthose countries or territories with regard to electricity;\namending the list of third countries and territories listed in point 1 or 2 of Annex III, either by adding those\ncountries or territories to that list, in order to exclude from the CBAM those third countries or territories that\nare fully integrated into, or linked to, the EU ETS in the event of future agreements, or by removing third\ncountries or territories from that list, thereby subjecting them to the CBAM, where they do not effectively\ncharge the EU ETS price on goods exported to the Union;\nsupplementing this Regulation by specifying the conditions for granting accreditation to verifiers, control and\noversight of accredited verifiers, withdrawal of accreditation, and mutual recognition and peer evaluation of the\naccreditation bodies;\nsupplementing this Regulation by further defining the timing, administration and other aspects of the sale and\nrepurchase of CBAM certificates; and\namending the list of goods in Annex I by adding, in certain circumstances, goods that have been slightly modified, in order to strengthen measures that address practices of circumvention.\nIt is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (?). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(78) Such consultations should be conducted in a transparent manner and may include prior consultations of stakeholders, such as competent bodies, industry (including SMEs), social partners such as trade unions, civil society organisations and environmental organisations.\n(79) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\nof the European Parliament and of the Council (+).\n(80) The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties. The CBAM should therefore rely on appropriate and effective mechanisms for avoiding losses of revenues.\n(81) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global carbon emissions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(82) In order to allow for the timely adoption of delegated and implementing acts under this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\n°) OJ L123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.\n(?!)

the CO, emission factor is the result of the division of the CO, emission data of the\nelectricity sector by the gross electricity generation based on fossil fuels in the relevant geographic area; it is\nexpressed in tonnes of CO, per megawatt-hour;\n(e) ‘emission factor for electricity’ means the default value, expressed in CO,¢e, representing the emission intensity of\nelectricity consumed in production of goods;\n(f) ‘power purchase agreement’ means a contract under which a person agrees to purchase electricity directly from\nan electricity producer;\n(g) ‘transmission system operator’ means an operator as defined in Article 2, point (35), of Directive (EU) 2019/944\nof the European Parliament and of the Council (').\nDETERMINATION OF ACTUAL SPECIFIC EMBEDDED EMISSIONS FOR SIMPLE GOODS\nFor determining the specific actual embedded emissions of simple goods produced in a given installation, direct and, where applicable, indirect emissions shall be accounted for. For that purpose, the following equation is to be applied:\nAttrEm,\nSEE, =\nAL,\nWhere:\nSEE,\nare the specific embedded emissions of goods g, in terms of CO,e per tonne; are the attributed emissions of goods g, and is the activity level of the goods, being the quantity of the goods produced in the reporting period in that installation.\nAttrEm,\nAL,\n‘Attributed emissions’ mean the part of the installation’s emissions during the reporting period that are caused by the production process resulting in goods g when applying the system boundaries of the production process defined by the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7). The attributed emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:\nAttrEm, = DirEm + IndirEm\nWhere:\nDirEm\nare the direct emissions, resulting from the production process, expressed in tonnes of CO;e, within the system boundaries referred to in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 7(7), and\n(‘) Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, p. 125).\nEN\nL 130/99\nIndirEm\nDETERMINATION OF ACTUAL EMBEDDED EMISSIONS FOR COMPLEX GOODS\nWhere:\nis the mass of input material (precursor) i used in the production process, and\nM;\nSEE;\nDETERMINATION OF DEFAULT VALUES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 7(2) AND (3)\n4.1 Default values referred to in Article 7(2)\n16.5.2023\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nare the indirect emissions resulting from the production of electricity consumed in the production processes of goods, expressed in tonnes of CO,e, within the system boundaries referred to in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 7(7).\nFor determining the specific actual embedded emissions of complex goods produced in a given installation, the following equation is to be applied:\nAttrEm, ++EEtnpMat\nSEE, =\nALg\nWhere:\nare the attributed emissions of goods g;\nAttrEm,\nis the activity level of the goods, being the quantity of goods produced in the reporting period in that installation, and\nAL\n8\nEEtnpMat\nare the embedded emissions of the input materials (precursors) consumed in the production process. Only input materials (precursors) listed as relevant to the system boundaries of the production process as specified in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) are to be considered. The relevant EEjnpmat are calculated as follows:\nEEtmpMat = > Mste\nare the specific embedded emissions for the input material (precursor) i. For SEE; the operator of the installation shall use the value of emissions resulting from the installation where the input material (precursor) was produced, provided that that installation’s data can be adequately measured.\nFor the purpose of determining default values, only actual values shall be used for the determination of embedded emissions. In the absence of actual data, literature values may be used. The Commission shall publish guidance for the approach taken to correct for waste gases or greenhouse gases used as process input, before collecting the data required to determine the relevant default values for each type of goods listed in Annex I. Default values shall be determined based on the best available data. Best available data shall be based on reliable and publicly available information. Default values shall be revised periodically through the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) based on the most up-to-date and reliable information, including on the basis of information provided by a third country or group of third countries.\nWhen actual emissions cannot be adequately determined by the authorised CBAM declarant, default values shall be used. Those values shall be set at the average emission intensity of each exporting country and for each of the goods listed in Annex I other than electricity, increased by a proportionately designed mark-up. This mark-up shall be determined in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) and shall be set at an appropriate level to ensure the environmental integrity of the CBAM, building on the most up-to-date and reliable information, including on the basis of information gathered during the transitional period. When reliable data for the exporting country cannot be applied for a type of goods, the default values shall be based on the average emission intensity of the X % worst performing EU ETS installations for that type of goods. The value of X shall be determined in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) and shall be set at an appropriate level to ensure the environmental integrity of the CBAM, building on the most up-to-date and reliable information, including on the basis of information gathered during the transitional period.\nL 130/100\n4.2.1. Specific default values for a third country, group of third countries or region within a third country\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nDefault values for imported electricity shall be determined for a third country, group of third countries or region within a third country based on either specific default values, in accordance with point 4.2.1, or, if those values are not available, on alternative default values, in accordance with point 4.2.2.\nWhere the electricity is produced in a third country, group of third countries or region within a third country, and transits through third countries, groups of third countries, regions within a third country or Member States with the purpose of being imported into the Union, the default values to be used are those from the third country, group of third countries or region within a third country where the electricity was produced.\n4.2 Default values for imported electricity referred to in Article 7(3)\n16.5.2023\nSpecific default values shall be set at the CO, emission factor in the third country, group of third countries or region within a third country, based on the best data available to the Commission.\n4.2.2. Alternative default values\nWhere a specific default value is not available for a third country, a group of third countries, or a region within a third country, the alternative default value for electricity shall be set at the CO, emission factor in the Union.\nWhere it can be demonstrated, on the basis of reliable data, that the CO, emission factor in a third country, a group of third countries or a region within a third country is lower than the specific default value determined by the Commission or lower than the CO, emission factor in the Union, an alternative default value based on that CO, emission factor may be used for that third country, group of third countries or region within a third country.\nDefault values for the indirect emissions embedded in a good produced in a third country shall be determined on a default value calculated on the average, of either the emission factor of the Union electricity grid, the emission factor of the country of origin electricity grid or the CO, emission factor of price-setting sources in the country of origin, of the electricity used for the production of that good.\nWhere a third country, or a group of third countries, demonstrates to the Commission, on the basis of reliable data, that the average electricity mix emission factor or CO, emission factor of price-setting sources in the third country or group of third countries is lower than the default value for indirect emissions, an alternative default value based on that average CO, emission factor shall be established for this country or group of countries.\nThe Commission shall adopt, no later than 30 June 2025, an implementing act pursuant to Article 7(7) to further specify which of the calculation methods determined in accordance with the first subparagraph shall apply to the calculation of default values. For that purpose, the Commission shall base itself on the most up-to-date and reliable data, including on data gathered during the transitional period, as regards the quantity of electricity used for the production of the goods listed in Annex I, as well as the country of origin, generation source and emission factors related to that electricity. The specific calculation method shall be determined on the basis of the most appropriate way to achieve both of the following criteria:\n— the prevention of carbon leakage; — ensuring the environmental integrity of the CBAM.\nCONDITIONS FOR APPLYING ACTUAL EMBEDDED EMISSIONS IN IMPORTED ELECTRICITY\n4.3 Default values for embedded indirect emissions\nAn authorised CBAM declarant may apply actual embedded emissions instead of default values for the calculation referred to in Article 7(3) if the following cumulative criteria are met:\n16.5.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(a) the amount of electricity for which the use of actual embedded emissions is claimed is covered by a power purchase agreement between the authorised CBAM declarant and a producer of electricity located in a third country; (b) the installation producing electricity is either directly connected to the Union transmission system or it can be demonstrated that at the time of export there was no physical network congestion at any point in the network between the installation and the Union transmission system; (c) the installation producing electricity does not emit more than 550 grammes of CO) of fossil fuel origin per kilowatt-hour of electricity; (d) the amount of electricity for which the use of actual embedded emissions is claimed has been firmly nominated to the allocated interconnection capacity by all responsible transmission system operators in the country of origin, the country of destination and, if relevant, each country of transit, and the nominated capacity and the production of electricity by the installation refer to the same period of time, which shall not be longer than one hour; (e) the fulfilment of the above criteria is certified by an accredited verifier, who shall receive at least monthly interim reports demonstrating how those criteria are fulfilled. The accumulated amount of electricity under the power purchase agreement and its corresponding actual embedded emissions shall be excluded from the calculation of the country emission factor or the CO, emission factor used for the purpose of the calculation of indirect electricity embedded emissions in goods in accordance with point 4.3, respectively. CONDITIONS TO APPLYING ACTUAL EMBEDDED EMISSIONS FOR INDIRECT EMISSIONS An authorised CBAM declarant may apply actual embedded emissions instead of default values for the calculation referred to in Article 7(4) if it can demonstrate a direct technical link between the installation in which the imported good is produced and the electricity generation source or if the operator of that installation has concluded a power purchase agreement with a producer of electricity located in a third country for an amount of electricity that is equivalent to the amount for which the use of a specific value is claimed. ADAPTATION OF DEFAULT VALUES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 7(2) BASED ON REGION-SPECIFIC FEATURES Default values can be adapted to particular areas and regions within third countries where specific characteristics prevail in terms of objective emission factors. When data adapted to those specific local characteristics are available and more targeted default values can be determined, the latter may be used. Where declarants for goods originating in a third country, a group of third countries or a region within a third country can demonstrate, on the basis of reliable data, that alternative region-specific adaptations of default values are lower than the default values determined by the Commission, such region-specific adaptations can be used.\nL 130/101\nL 130/102\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nANNEX V\nBookkeeping requirements for information used for the calculation of embedded emissions for the purpose of Article 7(5)\n1.

The last report should be submitted by 31 January 2026 in respect of goods imported during the fourth quarter of 2025. (4) The Commission is to adopt implementing rules for those reporting requirements. (5) The reporting requirements should be limited to what is necessary to minimise the burden on importers in the transitional period and facilitate the smooth roll-out of the CBAM declaration requirements after the transitional period. (6) In line with Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the detailed rules for calculating embedded emissions of imported goods should be based on the methodology applicable under the Emission Trading Scheme for installations located in the EU, as notably specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 (’). The principles for determining the embedded emissions of the goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should aim at identifying the relevant production processes for goods categories, and to monitor the direct and indirect emissions of those production processes. Reporting during the transitional period should also take into account existing norms and procedures of relevant Union legislation. As regards the production of hydrogen and its derivatives, the reporting should take into account Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (?). (7) The system boundaries of production processes, including emissions data at installation level, attributed emissions of production processes and embedded emissions of goods should be used for determining data to be provided for the purpose of fulfilling the reporting obligations. For those obligations, the importers and indirect customs representatives should ensure the availability of information needed from the operators of installations. That information should be received in a timely manner for the importers and indirect customs representatives to fulfil their reporting obligations. That information should include standard emission factors to use for calculating direct embedded emissions, notably fuel emission factors and process emission factors and reference efficiency factors for electricity and heat production.

() Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 of 19 December 2018 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 (OJ L 334, 31.12.2018, 1).\np.\n() Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy\nfrom renewable sources (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 82).\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2023/1773\nof 17 August 2023\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(8)\nSince the beginning of the reporting period starts on 1 October 2023, importers and indirect customs representatives have limited time available to ensure compliance with the reporting obligations. Synergies can be obtained with the monitoring and reporting systems already used by third country operators. A temporary derogation to the calculation methods for reporting embedded emissions should therefore be allowed for a limited period, until end of 2024. That flexibility should apply when the operator in a third country is subject to a mandatory monitoring and reporting system associated to a carbon pricing scheme, or to other mandatory monitoring and reporting schemes, or when the operator is monitoring the emissions of the installation, including for an emissions reduction project.\n(9)\nFor a limited period, until 31 July 2024, reporting declarants that would not be able to obtain all the information from third country operators to determine the actual embedded emissions of the imported goods in accordance with the methodology set in Annex III to this Regulation should be able to use and refer to an alternative method for determining the direct embedded emissions.\n(10) The reporting obligations should also afford some flexibility for the determination of the production steps in installations that do not account for a significant part of the embedded direct emissions of the imported goods. Such would be typically the case for the final production steps of steel or aluminium downstream products. In that case, a derogation from the required reporting obligations should be provided and estimated values may be reported for the production steps in installations whose contribution to direct emissions do not exceed 20 % of the total embedded emissions of the imported goods. That threshold should ensure sufficient flexibility for small operators in third countries.\n(11) One of the objectives of the transitional period is to collect data for the purpose of further specifying, in the implementing act pursuant to Article 7(7) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the methodology for calculating embedded indirect emissions after that period. In that context, the reporting of indirect emissions during the transitional period should be open and designed to allow to select the most appropriate value among those listed in Section 4.3 in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Reporting of indirect emissions should however not include reporting based on the average emission factor of the Union grid as that value is already known by the Commission.\n(12) Data collected during the transitional period should provide the basis for the reports that the Commission is to present in accordance with Article 30(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Data collected during the transitional period should also help define a unique monitoring, reporting and verification methodology after the transitional period. The assessment of data collected should in particular be used for the Commission’s work in view of adjusting the methodology applicable after the transitional period.\n(13) The indicative range of penalties that are to be imposed on a reporting declarant who has failed to respect the reporting obligations should be based on the default values made available and published by the Commission for the transitional period for the embedded emissions that were not reported. The indicative maximum range should be coherent with the penalty pursuant to Article 16(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘), while also taking into account that the obligation in the transitional period is limited to data reporting. The criteria to be used by competent authorities for determining the actual amount of the penalty should be based on the gravity and duration of the failure to report. The Commission should monitor the CBAM reports in order to provide for an indicative assessment of the information needed by the competent authorities and to ensure coherency of the penalties to be applied.\n(14) In order to ensure the efficient implementation of reporting obligations, an electronic database, the CBAM Transitional Registry, should be established by the Commission to collect the information reported during the transitional period. The CBAM Transitional Registry should be the basis for the establishment of the CBAM Registry pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\n(‘) Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).\nL 228/95\nL 228/96\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(15) The CBAM Transitional Registry should become the system for the filing and management of the CBAM reports for reporting declarants, including checks, indicative assessments, and review procedures. To ensure an accurate assessment of the reporting obligations, the CBAM Transitional Registry should be interoperable with existing customs systems.\n(16) In order to ensure an effective and uniform reporting system, technical arrangements for the functioning of the CBAM Transitional Registry should be laid down, such as arrangements for the development, testing and deployment as well as for the maintenance and potential modifications of the electronic systems, data protection, updating of data, limitation of data processing, systems ownership, and security. These arrangements should be compatible with the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (?) and Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (°), as well as with security of processing under Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n(17) In order to ensure the continuity of data reporting at all times, it is important to provide for alternative solutions to be implemented in the event of a temporary failure of the electronic systems for data reporting. To that effect, the Commission should work on a CBAM business continuity plan.\n(18) In order to secure access to the CBAM Transitional Registry, the Uniform User Management and Digital Signature (UUM&DS) system, as referred to in Article 16 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070 (’), should be used for managing, the authentication, and access verification process for reporting declarants.\n(19) For the purpose of identifying the reporting declarants and establishing a list of the reporting declarants with their Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) numbers, the CBAM Transitional Registry should be interoperable with the Economic Operator Registration and Identification system, as referred to in Article 30 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070.\n(20) For checking and reporting purposes, the national systems should provide the required information on goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, as referred in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2151 (°).\n(21) Identifying imported goods by means of their classification in the Combined Nomenclature (‘CN’) set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (°) and the storage provisions set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070 should be used for providing information on imported goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\n(22) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and notably the right to protection of personal data. The personal data of economic operators and other persons processed by the electronic systems should be restricted to the dataset set out in Annex I to this Regulation.

Relevant precursors: none.\nL 228/142\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nANNEX III\nRules for determining data including on emissions at installation level, attributed emissions of production processes, and embedded emissions of goods\nPRINCIPLES A.l Overall approach For the purpose of determining embedded emissions of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the following activities shall be performed: (a) The production processes relating to goods produced in the installation shall be identified using the aggregated goods categories as defined in Section 2 of Annex II, as well as the relevant production routes listed in Section 3 of Annex II, taking into account the rules for setting system boundaries of production processes in accordance with Section A.4 of this Annex. (b) At the level of the installation producing the goods, the direct emissions of the greenhouse gases specified in Annex II for those goods shall be monitored in line with the methods provided in Section B of this Annex. (c) Where measurable heat is imported to, produced in, consumed in or exported from the installation, net heat flows and the emissions associated with the production of that heat shall be monitored in line with the methods provided in Section C of this Annex. (d) For the purpose of monitoring indirect emissions embedded in the goods produced, the consumption of electricity in the relevant production processes shall be monitored in line with the methods provided in Section D.1 of this Annex. Where electricity is produced within the installation or by a source with a direct technical link, the emissions associated with that electricity production shall be monitored in order to determine the emission factor for that electricity. Where the installation receives electricity from the grid, the emission factor for that electricity shall be determined according to Section D.2.3 of this Annex. Any quantities of electricity transferred between production processes or exported from the installation shall be monitored as well. (e) The direct emissions at the installations, with heat production and consumption, electricity production and consumption, and any relevant waste gas streams shall be attributed to the production processes associated with the goods produced by applying the rules provided in Section F of this Annex. Those attributed emissions shall be used to calculate the specific direct and indirect embedded emissions of the goods produced, applying the Section F of this Annex. (f) Where Section 3 of Annex II defines relevant precursors for goods produced in the installations, making those goods ‘complex goods’, the embedded emissions of the relevant precursor shall be determined according to Section E of this Annex, and shall be added to the embedded emissions of the complex goods produced, by applying the rules provided in Section G of this Annex. Where precursors are themselves complex goods, that process shall be repeated recursively until no more precursors are at stake. Where an operator cannot adequately determine actual data for one or more data sets, by applying methods provided in Section A.3 of this Annex, and where no other method for closing data gaps is available, the default values made available and published by the Commission for the transitional period may be used under the conditions specified in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. In that case, a short explanation of the reasons for not using actual data shall be added. Monitoring shall cover a reporting period which ensures that non-representative data due to short-time fluctuations in the production processes and data gaps are avoided to the highest extent feasible. The default reporting period is a calendar year. However, the operator may choose as alternative: (a) if the installation has a compliance obligation under an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system,\nthat system’s reporting period may be used, if it covers at least three months;\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(b) the operator's fiscal year provided such period ensures higher data quality than the use of the calendar year.\nThe embedded emissions of goods shall be calculated as average of the reporting period chosen.\nRegarding emissions occurring outside the installation boundaries that are relevant for calculating embedded\nemissions, data for the latest available reporting period shall be used, as obtained from the supplier of the input\n(e.g. electricity, heat, precursor). Emissions occurring outside the installation boundaries include:\n(a) indirect emissions where electricity is received from the grid;\n(b) emissions from electricity and heat imported from other installations;\n(c) embedded direct and indirect emissions of precursors received from other installations.\nEmissions data over a full reporting period shall be expressed in tonnes COze rounded to full tonnes.\nAll parameters used to calculate the emissions shall be rounded to include all significant digits for the purpose of\ncalculating and reporting emissions.\nSpecific direct and indirect embedded emissions shall be expressed in tonnes of COe per tonne of goods, rounded to include all significant digits, with a maximum of 5 digits after the comma.\nA.2. Monitoring principles\nFor the monitoring of actual data at installation level, and for data sets necessary for attributing emissions to goods, the following principles shall apply:\n1. Completeness: The monitoring methodology shall cover all parameters necessary to determine the embedded emissions of the goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in accordance with the methods and formulae contained in this Annex. (a) Direct emissions at installation level include combustion and process emissions. (b) Direct embedded emissions include the attributed emissions of the relevant production process in accordance with Section F of this Annex, based on direct emissions at the installation, emissions related to relevant heat flows and to material flows between process system boundaries, including waste gases, if relevant. Direct embedded emissions furthermore include the direct embedded emissions of relevant precursors. (c) Indirect emissions at the installation level cover the emissions related to electricity consumption within the installation. (d) Indirect embedded emissions include the indirect emissions of the goods produced within the installation, and the indirect embedded emissions of relevant precursors. (e) For each parameter, an appropriate method in accordance with Section A.3 of this Annex shall be selected, ensuring that neither double counting nor data gaps occur. Consistency and comparability: Monitoring and reporting shall be consistent and comparable over time. To that end, the selected methods shall be laid down in a written monitoring methodology documentation so that the methods are used consistently. The methodology shall be changed only if objectively justified. Relevant reasons include: (a) changes in the configuration of the instalation in the technology used, in the input materials and fuels, or in the goods produced; (b) new data sources or monitoring methods have to be introduced because of changes of trade partners responsible for data used in the monitoring methodology; (c) the accuracy of the data can be improved, data flows can be simplified or the control system can be improved.\nL 228/143\nL 228/144\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n3.\nTransparency: Monitoring data shall be obtained, recorded, compiled, analysed and documented, including assumptions, references, activity data, emission factors, calculation factors, data on embedded emissions of purchased precursors, measurable heat and electricity, default values of embedded emissions, information on a carbon price due, and any other data relevant for the purpose of this Annex, in a transparent manner that enables the reproduction of the determination of emissions data including by independent third parties, such as accredited verifiers. Documentation shall include a record of all changes of methodology.\nComplete and transparent records shall be kept at the installation of all data relevant for determining embedded emissions of the goods produced, including necessary supporting documents, for at least 4 years after the reporting period. Those records may be disclosed to a reporting declarant.\nAccuracy: The chosen monitoring methodology shall ensure that emission determination is neither systematically nor knowingly inaccurate. Any source of inaccuracies shall be identififed and reduced as far as possible. Due diligence shall be exercised to ensure that the calculation and measurement of emissions exhibit the highest achievable accuracy.\nWhere data gaps have occurred or are expected to be unavoidable, substitute data shall consist of conservative estimates. Further cases where emissions data shall be based on conservative estimates include:\n(a) carbon monoxide (CO) emitted to the atmosphere shall be calculated as the molar equivalent amount of CO,;\n(b) all biomass emissions in mass balances and for transferred CO,, where it is not possible to determine the biomass content in materials or fuels, the emissions shall be considered to be from fossil carbon.\nIntegrity of methodology: The chosen monitoring methodology shall enable reasonable assurance of the integrity of emission data to be reported. Emissions shall be determined using the appropriate monitoring methodologies set out in this Annex. Reported emission data shall be free from material misstatement, avoid bias in the selection and presentation of information, and provide a credible and balanced account of the embedded emissions of installation’s produced goods.\nOptional measures to increase the quality of the data to be reported may be applied, in particular the data flow and control activities in line with Section H of this Annex.\nCost-effectiveness: In selecting a monitoring methodology, the improvements from greater accuracy shall be balanced against additional costs. Monitoring and reporting of emissions shall aim for the highest achievable accuracy, unless that is technically not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs.\nContinuous improvement: It shall be regularly checked if monitoring methodologies can be improved. If verification of emissions data is performed, any recommendations for improvements included in the verification reports shall be considered for implementation within a reasonable timeframe, unless the improvement would incur unreasonable costs or would be technically not feasible.\nFor the determination of embedded emissions of goods, and for underlying data sets, such as emissions related to individual source streams or emission sources, quantities of measurable heat, the overarching principle shall be to always select the best available data source. For this purpose, the following guiding principles shall apply:\n(a) Monitoring methods described in this Annex are preferred. If for a specific data set there is no monitoring method described in this Annex, or it would incur unreasonable costs or is technically not feasible, monitoring methods from another eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system may be used under the conditions specified in Article 4(2) of this Regulation, if they cover the required data set. Where such methods are not available, not technically feasible, or would incur unreasonable costs, indirect methods for determination of the data set in\nA.3. Methods representing the best available data source\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\naccordance with point 2 may be used. Where such methods are not available, not technically feasible, or would incur unreasonable costs, default values made available and published by the Commission for the transitional period may be used under the conditions specified in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. (b) For direct or indirect determination methods, a method is deemed suitable where it is ensured that any metering, analyses, sampling, calibrations, and validations for the determination of the specific data set are carried out by applying methods defined in relevant EN or ISO standards. Where such standards are not available, national standards may be used. Where no applicable published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best practice guidelines or other scientifically proven methodologies shall be used, limiting sampling and measurement bias. (c) Within one method mentioned in point (a), measuring instruments or laboratory analyses under the operator's control shall be preferred over measuring instruments or analyses under the control of another legal entity, such as the supplier of fuel or materials or trade partners regarding goods produced. (d) Measuring instruments shall be selected such that they exhibit the lowest uncertainty in use without incurring unreasonable costs. Instruments under legal metrological control are preferred, except where other instruments with significantly lower uncertainty in use are available. Instruments shall be used only in environments appropriate according to their use specification. (e) Where laboratory analyses are used, or where laboratories carry out sample treatment, calibrations, method validations, or activities relating to continuous emissions measurements, the requirements of Section B.5.4.3 of this Annex shall apply.\nIndirect determination methods: Where no direct determination method is available for a required data set, in particular for cases where net measurable heat going into different production processes needs to be determined, an indirect determination method may be used, such as: (a) calculation based on a known chemical or physical process, using appropriate accepted literature values for the chemical and physical properties of substances involved, appropriate stoichiometric factors and thermodynamic properties such as reaction enthalpies, as appropriate; (b) calculation based on the installation’s design data such as the energy efficiencies of technical units or calculated energy consumption per unit of product; (c) correlations based on empirical tests for determining estimation values for the required data set from non- calibrated equipment or data documented in production protocols. For that purpose it shall be ensured that the correlation satisfies the requirements of good engineering practice and that it is applied only to determine values which fall into the range for which it was established. The validity of such correlations shall be evaluated at least once a year.\nTo determine the best available data sources, the data source highest in the ranking presented under point 1 and already available at the installation shall be selected. However, where it is technically feasible to apply a data source higher in the ranking without incurring unreasononable costs, such better data source shall be applied without undue dalay. Where different data sources are available for the same data set at the same level in the ranking presented under point 1, the data source which ensures the clearest data flow with lowest inherent risk and control risk regarding misstatements shall be chosen.\nThe data sources chosen under point 3 shall be used for the determination and reporting of embedded emissions.\nTo the extent feasible without incurring unreasonable costs, for the purpose of the control system in accordance with Section H of this Annex, additional data sources or methods for determining data sets shall be identified to allow corroboration of data sources under point 3. The selected data sources, if any, shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation.\nL 228/145\nL 228/146\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nRecommended improvements: It shall be checked regularly, but at least once per year, whether new data sources have become available, for the purpose of improving the monitoring methods. In the case that such new data sources are considered more accurate in accordance with the ranking presented under point 1, they shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation and be applied from the earliest date possible.\nTechnical feasibility: Where a claim is made that applying a specific determination methodology is technically not feasible, a justification for this fact shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation. It shall be re-assessed during the regular checks in line with point 6. That justification shall be based on whether the installation has technical resources capable of meeting the needs of a proposed data source or monitoring method that can be implemented in the required time for the purposes of this Annex. Those technical resources shall include availability of required techniques and technology.\nUnreasonable costs: Where a claim is made that applying a specific determination methodology for a data set incurs unreasonable costs, a justification for this fact shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation. It shall be re-assessed during the regular checks in line with point 6. The unreasonable nature of the costs shall be determined as follows.\nCosts for determining a specific data set is considered unreasonable where the operator's cost estimation exceeds the benefit of a specific determination methodology. To that end, the benefit shall be calculated by multiplying an improvement factor with a reference price of EUR 20 per tonne of CO,e and costs shall include an appropriate depreciation period based on the economic lifetime of the equipment, where applicable.\nThe improvement factor shall be:\n(a) the improvement of estimated uncertainty in a measurement, expressed in per cent, multiplied with the related emissions over the reporting period. Related emissions means: (1) the direct emissions caused by the source stream or emission source concerned; (2) emissions attributed to a quantity of measurable heat; (3) the indirect emissions related to the quantity of electricity concerned; (4) embedded emissions of a material produced or of a precursor consumed;\nestimated\n(b) 1% of the related emissions, where no improvement of measuring uncertainty is involved.\nMeasures relating to the improvement of an installation’s monitoring methodology shall not be deemed to incur unreasonable costs up to an accumulated amount of EUR 2 000 per year.\nAA. Division of installations into production processes\nInstallations shall be divided into production processes with system boundaries which ensure that relevant inputs, outputs and emissions can be monitored in accordance with Sections B to E of this Annex and direct and indirect emissions can be attributed to groups of goods defined in Section 2 of Annex II, by applying the rules of Section F of this Annex.\nInstallations shall be divided into production processes as follows:\n(a) A single production process shall be defined for each of the aggregated goods categories defined in Section 2 of Annex II that are relevant at the installation. (b) By way of derogation from point (a), separate production processes shall be defined for each production route where different production routes in accordance with Section 3 of Annex II for the same aggregated goods category are applied in the same installation, or where the operator selects voluntarily different goods or groups of goods for separate monitoring. A more disaggregated definition of production processes may also be used where it is in accordance with an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system applicable at the installation.\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nB.1.\nCompleteness of source streams and emission sources\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(c) By way of derogation from point (a), where at least a part of the precursors relevant for complex goods are produced in the same installation as the complex goods, and where the respective precursors are not transferred out of the installation for sale or use in other installations, the production of precursors and complex goods may be covered by a joint production process. Separate calculation of embedded emissions of the precursors shall be omitted in that case.\n(d) The following sectoral derogations from point (a) may be applied:\n(1) Where two or more goods from the aggregated goods categories sintered ore, pig iron, FeMn, FeCr, FeNi, DRI,\ncrude steel, or iron or steel products are produced in the same installation, the embedded emissions may be\nmonitored and reported by defining one joint production process for all those goods.\n(2) Where two or more goods from the groups unwrought aluminium or aluminium products are produced in the\nsame installation, the embedded emissions may be monitored and reported by defining one joint production\nprocess for all those goods.\n(3) For the production of mixed fertilisers, the monitoring and reporting for the respective production process may be simplified by determining one uniform value of embedded emissions per tonne of nitrogen contained in the mixed fertilisers, irrespective of the chemical form of nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate or urea forms).\n(e) Where a part of the installation serves the production of goods not listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, it is a recommended improvement to monitor that part as one additional production process for the purpose of corroborating the completeness of the installation’s total emissions data.\nMONITORING OF DIRECT EMISSIONS AT INSTALLATION LEVEL\nB\nThe boundaries of the installation and its production processes shall be clearly known to the operator and defined in the monitoring methodology documentation, taking into account the sector-specific requirements laid down in Section 2 of Annex II as well as Section B.9 of this Annex. The following principles shall apply:\n1. As a minimum, all relevant greenhouse gas emissions emission sources and source streams associated directly or indirectly with the production of goods listed in Section 2 of Annex II shall be covered. It is a recommended improvement to cover all emission sources and source streams of the total installation, in order to perform plausibility checks and to control the energy and emissions efficiency of the installation as a whole. All emissions from regular operations shall be included, as well as from abnormal events, including start-up, shut-down and emergency situations, over the reporting period. Emissions from mobile machinery for transportation purposes shall be excluded.\nB.2. Choice of monitoring methodology\nThe applicable methodology shall be either:\n1 The calculation-based methodology, which consists in determining emissions from source streams on the basis of activity data obtained by means of measurement systems and additional parameters from laboratory analyses or standard values. The calculation-based methodology may be implemented according to the standard method or the mass balance method. The measurement-based methodology, which consists in determining emissions from emission sources by means of continuous measurement of the concentration of the relevant greenhouse gas in the flue gas and of the flue gas flow.\nBy way of derogation, other methodologies may be used under the conditions specified in Articles 4(2), 4(3) and 5 of this Regulation.\nThe monitoring methodology that gives the most accurate and reliable results shall be chosen, except where sector-specific requirements in accordance with Section B.9 require one particular methodology. The applied monitoring methodology may be a combination of methodologies such that different parts of the installation’s emissions are monitored by either of the applicable methodologies.\nL 228/147\nL 228/148\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nThe monitoring methodology documentation shall clearly identify:\n(a) for which source stream the calculation-based standard method or the mass balance method is used, including the detailed description of the determination of each relevant parameter provided in Section B.3.4 of this Annex; (b) for which emission source a measurement-based methodology is used, including the description of all relevant elements provided in Section B.6 of this Annex; (c) by means of a suitable diagram and process description of the installation, evidence that there is neither double counting nor data gaps in the emissions of the installation.\nThe installation’s emissions shall be determined by\n(Equation 4)\nWhere:\nEminst\nare the (direct) emissions of the installation expressed in tonnes CO,¢; are the emissions from source stream i determined using a calculation-based methodology expressed in tonnes CO;e; are the emissions from emission source j determined using a measurement-based methodology expressed in tonnes CO,e; and Emissions determined by another method, index k expressed in tonnes CO ¢.\nE Megici\nEM\nmeas,j\nEmMotherk\nB.3.\nB.3.1.

However, it is a recommended improvement to report NCV for allowing consistency checking and monitoring of the energy efficiency of the whole production process.\nIf the emission factor of a fuel i is to be calculated from the analyses of carbon content and NCYV, the following equation shall be used:\nEF, = CC, f/NCY,\n(Equation 8)\nIf the emission factor of a material or fuel expressed in t CO,/t is to be calculated from an analysed carbon content, the following equation is used:\nEF, =CC,+f\n(Equation 9)\nWhere:\nf\nis the ratio of the molar masses of CO, and C: f= 3,664 t CO,/t C.\nAs the emission factor of biomass shall be zero provided that the criteria given in Section B.3.3 are met, this fact may be taken into account for mixed fuels (i.e. fuels which contain both fossil and biomass components) as follows:\nEF,=E FE pre, - (1-BF,)\nis the preliminary emission factor of fuel i (ie. emission factor assuming the total fuel is fossil); and is the biomass fraction (dimensionless) of fuel i.\n(Equation 10)\nWhere:\nEF, pre,i\nBF,\nFor fossil fuels and where the biomass fraction is not known, BF, shall be set to the conservative value zero.\nB.3.1.2. Process emissions\nProcess emissions shall be calculated using the standard method as follows:\nEm, = AD, « EF, « CF,\n(Equation 11)\nWhere:\nAD; is the activity data [t of material] of material j; EF, is the emission factor [t CO,/t] of material j; and CF, is the conversion factor (dimension-less) of material j.\nThe conservative assumption that CF, = 1 may always be used in order to reduce monitoring efforts.\nIn the case of mixed process input materials which contain inorganic as well as organic forms of carbon, the operator may choose either:\nto determine a total preliminary emission factor for the mixed material by analysing the total carbon content (CC), and using a conversion factor and, where applicable a biomass fraction and net calorific value related to that total carbon content; or to determine the organic and inorganic contents separately and treat them as two separate source streams.\nL 228/150\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nConsidering the available measurement systems for activity data and methods for determining the emission factor, for emissions from the decomposition of carbonates, the method giving the more accurate results shall be chosen for each source stream from the following two methods:\n— Method A (Input-based): The emission factor, conversion factor and activity data shall be related to the amount of material input into the process. The standard emission factors of pure carbonates as provided in Table 3 in Annex VIII shall be used, taking into account the composition of the material as determined in line with Section B.5 of this Annex. — Method B (Output-based): The emission factor, conversion factor and activity data shall be related to the amount of output from the process. The standard emission factors of metal oxides after decarbonatisation as provided in Table 4 in Annex VIII shall be used, taking into account the composition of the relevant material as determined in line with Section B.5 of this Annex.\nFor CO, process emissions other than from carbonates, method A shall be applied.\nB.3.2. Mass balance method\nThe CO, quantities relevant for each source stream shall be calculated based on the carbon content in each material, without distinguishing fuels and process materials. Carbon leaving the installation in products instead of being emitted is taken into account by output source streams, which have therefore negative activity data.\nThe emissions corresponding to each source stream shall be calculated as follows:\nEm, =f + AD, + CC,\n(Equation 12)\nWhere:\nAD, is the activity data [t] of material k; for outputs, AD, is negative; is the ratio of the molar masses of CO, and C: f = 3,664 t CO,/t C; and cc, is the carbon content of material k (dimensionless and positive).\nIf the carbon content of a fuel k is calculated from an emission factor expressed in t CO,/T], the following equation shall be used:\n(Equation 13)\nIf the carbon content of a material or fuel k is calculated from an emission factor expressed in t CO,/t, the following equation shall be used:\n= CC, EF, /f\nFor mixed fuels, meaning fuels which contain both fossil and biomass components or mixed materials, the biomass fraction may be taken into account, provided that the criteria provided in Section B.3.3 are met as follows:\nFor fossil fuels or materials and where the biomass fraction is not known, BF shall be set to the conservative value zero. Where biomass is used as input material or fuel, and output materials contain carbon, the overall mass balance shall treat the biomass fraction conservatively, meaning that the fraction of biomass in total output carbon shall not exceed the total fraction of biomass contained in input materials and fuels, except if the operator provides evidence of a higher biomass fraction in the output materials by a ‘trace the atom’ (stoichiometric) method or by *C analyses.\nf\n15.9.2023\nCC, = EF, « NCV,/f\n(Equation 14)\nCC, = Cyne * (1- BF)\nWhere:\nCCprek\nis the preliminary carbon content of fuel k (i.e. emission factor assuming the total fuel is fossil); and is the biomass fraction of fuel k (dimensionless).\nBF,\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nB.3.3. Criteria for zero-rating of biomass emissions\nWhere biomass is used as a fuel for combustion, it shall fulfil the criteria of this section. Where the biomass used for combustion does not comply with these criteria, its carbon content shall be considered as fossil carbon.\n1 The biomass shall comply with the sustainability and the greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. By derogation from the previous point, biomass contained in or produced from waste and residues, other than agricultural, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry residues shall fulfil only the criteria laid down in Article 29(10) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. This point shall also apply to waste and residues that are first processed into a product before being further processed into fuels. Electricity, heating and cooling produced from municipal solid waste shall not be subject to the criteria laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 shall apply irrespective of the geographical origin of the biomass. The compliance with the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 shall be assessed in accordance with Articles 30 and 31(1) of that Directive.\nL 228/151\nB.3.4. Relevant parameters\nIn line with the formulae given in Sections B.3.1 to B.3.3 of this Annex, the following parameters shall be determined for each source stream:\n1. Standard method, combustion:\n— Minimum requirement: Fuel quantity (t or m’), Emission factor (t CO./t or t CO,/m’).\n— Recommended improvement: Fuel quantity (t or m’), NCV (T]/t or TJ/m’), Emission factor (t CO,/TJ), Oxidation factor, Biomass fraction, evidence for meeting the criteria of Section B.3.3.\n2. Standard method, process emissions:\n— Minimum requirement: Activity data (t or m’), Emission factor (t CO,/t or t CO./m’).\n— Recommended improvement: Activity data (t or m’), Emission factor (t CO,/t or t CO2/m’), conversion factor.\n3. Mass balance:\n— Minimum requirement: Material quantity (t), Carbon content (t C/t material).\n— Recommended improvement: Material quantity (t), Carbon content (t C/t material), NCV (TJ/t), biomass fraction, evidence for meeting the criteria of Section B.3.3.\nB.4. Requirements for activity data\nB.4.1. Continual or batch-wise metering\nWhere quantities of fuels or materials, including goods or intermediate products, have to be determined for a reporting period, one of the following methods may be chosen and laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation:\n1. based on continual metering at the process where the material is consumed or produced;\n2. based on aggregation of metering of quantities separately (batch-wise) delivered or produced taking into account relevant stock changes. For this purpose the following shall apply: (a) the quantity of fuel or material consumed during the reporting period shall be calculated as the quantity of fuel or material imported during the reporting period, minus the quantity of fuel or material exported, plus the quantity of fuel or material in stock at the beginning of the reporting period, minus the quantity of fuel or material in stock at the end of the reporting period;\nL 228/152\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n(b) the production levels of goods or intermediate products shall be calculated as the quantity exported during the reporting period, minus the quantity imported, minus the quantity of product or material in stock at the beginning of the reporting period, plus the quantity of product or material in stock at the end of the reporting period. For avoiding any double counting, products of a production process returned into the same production process are deducted from production levels.\nWhere it is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs to determine quantities in stock by direct measurement, those quantities may be estimated based on one of the following:\n1. data from previous years and correlated with appropriate activity levels for the reporting period; 2. documented procedures and respective data in audited financial statements for the reporting period.\nWhere the determination of quantities of products, materials or fuels for the entire reporting period is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs, the next most appropriate day may be chosen to separate a reporting period from the following one. It shall be reconciled accordingly to the reporting period required. The deviations involved for each product, material or fuel shall be clearly recorded to form the basis of a value representative for the reporting period and to be considered consistently in relation to the next year.\nB.4.2. Operator's control over measurement systems\nThe preferred method for determining quantities of products, materials or fuels shall be that the operator of the installation uses measurement systems under its own control. Measurement systems outside the operator’s own control, in particular if under the control of the supplier of the material or fuel, may be used in the following cases:\n1. where the operator does not have an own measurement system available for determining the respective data set;\nwhere determining the data set by the operator’s own measurement system is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs; where the operator has evidence that the measurement system outside the operator’s control gives more reliable results and is less prone to risks of misstatements.\nIn the case that measurement systems outside the operator's own control are used, applicable data sources shall be the following:\n(1) amounts from invoices issued by a trade partner, provided that a commercial transaction between two independent trade partners takes place;\n(2) direct readings from the measurement systems.\nB.4.3. Requirements for measurement systems\nA thorough understanding of the uncertainty associated with metering quantities of fuels and materials, including the influence of the operating environment and, where applicable, the uncertainty of stock determination shall be available. Measuring instrauments shall be chosen that ensure the lowest uncertainty available without incurring unreasonable costs and that are fit for the environment they are used in, in accordance with applicable technical standards and requirements. If available, instruments subject to legal metrological control shall be preferred. In this case, the maximum permissible error in service allowed by the relevant national legislation on legal metrological control for the relevant measuring task may be used as the uncertainty value.\nWhere a measuring instrument needs to be replaced because of malfunction or because calibration demonstrates that requirements are not met anymore, it shall be replaced by instruments that ensure meeting the same or a better uncertainty level compared to the existing instrument.\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nB.4.4. Recommended improvement\nIt is considered a recommended improvement to achieve a measurement uncertainty comensurate with the total emissions of the source stream or emission source, with lowest uncertainty for the biggest parts of the emissions. For orientation purposes, for emissions of more than 500 000 t CO) per year, the uncertainty over the full reporting period taking into account stock changes, if applicable, shall be 1,5 % or better. For emissions below 10 000 t CO, per year, uncertainty lower than 7,5 % shall be acceptable.\nL 228/153\nB.5. Requirements for calculation factors for CO,\nB.5.1. Methods for determining calculation factors\nFor the determination of calculation factors required for the calculation-based methodology, one of the following methods may be chosen:\n1 use of standard values;\nuse of proxy data based on a empirical correlations between the relevant calculation factor and other properties better accessible to measurement;\nuse of values based on laboratory analysis.\nCalculation factors shall be determined consistently with the state used for related activity data, referring to the fuel’s or material’s state in which the fuel or material is purchased or used in the emission causing process, before it is dried or otherwise treated for laboratory analysis. Where this incurs unreasonable costs or where higher accuracy can be achieved, activity data and calculation factors may be consistently reported referring to the state in which laboratory analyses are carried out.\nB.5.2. Applicable standard values\nType I standard values, shall be applicable only if no type II standard value is available for the same parameter and material or fuel.\nType I standard values shall be the following:\n(a) standard factors provided in Annex VIII; (b) standard factors contained in the latest IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories ('); (c) values based on laboratory analyses carried out in the past, not older than 5 years and considered representative for the fuel or material.\nType II standard values, shall be the following:\n(a) standard factors used by the country where the installation is located for its latest national inventory submission to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; (b) values published by national research institutions, public authorities, standardisation bodies, statistical offices, etc. for the purpose of more disaggregated emissions reporting than under the previous point; (c) values specified and guaranteed by the supplier of a fuel or material where there is evidence that the carbon content exhibits a 95 % confidence interval of not more than 1 %; (d) stoichiometric values for the carbon content and related literature values for the net calorific value (NCV) of a pure substance; (e) values based on laboratory analyses carried out in the past not older than two years and considered representative for the fuel or material.\n(‘) United Nations International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\nL 228/154\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nIn order to ensure consistency over time, any standard values used shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation, and only changed if there is evidence that the new value is more adequate and representative for the fuel or material used than the previous one. Where the standard values change on an annual basis, the authoritative applicable source of that value shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation instead of the value itself.\nB.5.3. Establishing correlations for determining proxy data\nA proxy for the carbon content or emission factor may be derived from the following parameters, in combination with an empirical correlation determined at least once per year in accordance with the requirements for laboratory analyses given in Section B.5.4 of this Annex as follows:\n(a) density measurement of specific oils or gases, including those common to the refinery or steel industry; (b) net calorific value for specific coal types.\nThe correlation has to satisfy the requirements of good industrial practice and may be applied only to values of the proxy which fall into the range for which it was established.\nB.5.4. Requirements for laboratory analyses\nWhere laboratory analyses are required for determining properties (including moisture, purity, concentration, carbon content, biomass fraction, net calorific value, density) of products, materials, fuels or waste gases, or for establishing correlations between parameters for the purpose of indirect determination of required data, the analyses shall comply with the requirements of this section.\nThe result of any analysis shall be used only for the delivery period or batch of fuel or material for which the samples have been taken, and for which the samples were intended to be representative. When determining a specific parameter, the results of all analyses made shall be used with regard to that parameter.\nB.5.4.1. Use of standards\nAny analyses, sampling, calibrations and validations for the determination of calculation factors shall be carried out by applying methods based on corresponding ISO standards. Where such standards are not available, the methods shall be based on suitable EN or national standards or requirements laid down in an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system. Where no applicable published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best practice guidelines or other scientifically proven methodologies may be used, limiting sampling and measurement bias.\nB.5.4.2. Recommendations on sampling plan and minimum frequency of analyses\nThe minimum frequencies for analyses for relevant fuels and materials listed in Table 1 of this Annex shall be used. Another analysis frequency may be used in the following cases:\n(a) where the table does not contain an applicable minimum frequency; (b) where an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system provides for another minimum analysis frequency for the same type of material or fuel; (c) where the minimum frequency listed in Table 1 of this Annex would incur unreasonable cost; (d) where it can be demonstrated that based on historical data, including analytical values for the respective fuels or materials in the reporting period immediately preceding the current reporting period, any variation in the analytical values for the respective fuel or material does not exceed 1/3 of the uncertainty in determining the activity data of the relevant fuel or material.\nWhere an installation operates for part of the year only, or where fuels or materials are delivered in batches that are consumed over more than one reporting period, a more appropriate schedule for analyses may be chosen, provided that it results in a comparable uncertainty as under the last point of the previous subparagraph.\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 228/155\nNatural gas\nOther gases, in particular synthesis gas and process gases\nAt least daily — using appropriate procedures at different\nsuch as refinery mixed gas, coke oven gas, blast-furnace gas, parts of the day\nconverter gas, oilfield, and gas field gas\nFuel oils (for example light, medium, heavy fuel oil, bitumen) Every 20 000 tonnes of fuel and at least six times a year\nCoal, coking coal, coke, petroleum coke, peat\nEvery 20 000 tonnes of fuel/material and at least six times a\nyear\nFuel/material\nTable 1\nMinimum analyses frequencies\nMinimum frequency of analyses\nAt least weekly\nOther fuels\nEvery 10 000 tonnes of fuel and at least four times a year\nUntreated solid waste (pure fossil or mixed biomass/fossil) Every 5 000 tonnes of waste and at least four times a year\nLiquid waste, pre-treated solid waste\nEvery 10 000 tonnes of waste and at least four times a year\nCarbonate minerals (including limestone and dolomite)\nEvery 50 000 tonnes of material and at least four times a year\nClays and shales\nAmounts of material corresponding to emissions of 50 000\ntonnes of CO, and at least four times a year\nOther materials (primary, intermediate, and final product) Depending on the type of material and the variation,\namounts of material corresponding to emissions of 50 000\ntonnes of CO, and at least four times a year\nSamples shall be representative for the total batch or time period of deliveries for which they are taken. In order to ensure representativeness, the heterogenety of the material has to be taken into account, as well as all other relevant aspects such as the avilable sampling equipment, possible segregation of phases or local distribution of particle sizes, stability of samples, etc. The sampling method shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation.\nIt is considered a recommended improvement to use a dedicated sampling plan for each relevant material or fuel, following applicable standards, containing the relevant information on methodologies for the preparation of samples, including information on responsibilities, locations, frequencies and quantities, and methodologies for the storage and transport of samples.\nB.5.4.3. Recommendations for laboratories\nLaboratories used to carry out analyses for the determination of calculation factors shall be accredited in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025, for the relevant analytical methods. Laboratories not accredited may be used for the determination of calculation factors only where there is evidence that access to accredited laboratories is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs, and that the non-accredited laboratory is sufficiently competent. A laboratory shall be considered sufficiently competent if it complies with all of the following:\n1. it is economically independent of the operator, or at least organisationally shielded from influence by the management of the installation;\n2. it applies the applicable standards for the analyses requested;\nL 228/156\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nit employs personnel competent for the specific tasks assigned; it appropriately manages the sampling and sample preparation, including control of sample integrity; it regularly carries out quality assurance on calibrations, sampling and analytical methods, by suitable methods, including regular participation in proficiency testing schemes, applying analytical methods to certified reference materials, or inter-comparison with an accredited laboratory; it manages equipment appropriately, including by maintaining and implementing procedures for calibration, adjustment, maintenance and repair of equipment, and record keeping thereof.\nB.5.5. Recommended methods for determination of calculation factors\nIt is considered a recommended improvement to apply standard values only for source streams which correspond to minor emission quantities, and to apply laboratory analyses for all major source streams. The following list presents the applicable methods in sequence of increasing data quality:\n1. type I standard values; 2 type II standard values; correlations for determining proxy data; analyses carried out outside the operator’s control, e.g. by the supplier of the fuel or material, contained in purchase documents, without further information on the methods applied; analyses in non-accredited laboratories, or in accredited laboratories, but with simplified sampling methods; analyses in accredited laboratories, applying best practice regarding sampling.\nRequirements for a measurement-based methodology for CO, and N,O\nA measurement-based methodology requires the use of a Continuous Emission Measurement System (CEMS) installed at a suitable measurement point.\nFor the monitoring of N,O emissions, the use of the measurement-based methodology, is mandatory. For CO, it shall be used only if there is evidence that it leads to more accurate data than the calculation-based methodology. The requirements on uncertainty of measurement systems pursuant to Section B.4.3 of this Annex shall apply.\nCO emitted to the atmosphere shall be treated as the molar equivalent amount of CO.\nWhere several emission sources exist in one installation and cannot be measured as one emission source, the operator shall measure emissions from those sources separately and add the results to obtain the total emissions of the gas in question over the reporting period.\nThe total emissions from an emission source over the reporting period shall be determined by summing up over the reporting period all hourly values of the measured greenhouse gas concentration multiplied by the hourly values of the flue gas flow, where the hourly values shall be averages over all individual measurement results of the respective operating hour, applying the formula:\nGHG EMa{t) =\n> HoursOp\n(GHG conCrounys * Viowyi) * 10~°[t/g] (Equation 16)\n1\n15.9.2023\nB.6.\nB.6.1.

Where data for shorter reference periods can be generated without additional cost, those periods shall be used for the determination of the annual emissions.\nL 228/157\nB.6.2.2. Determination of GHG concentration\nThe concentration of the GHG under consideration in the flue gas shall be determined by continuous measurement at a representative point through one of the following:\n— direct measurement of the concentration of the GHG;\n— indirect measurement: in the case of high concentration in the flue gas, the concentration of the GHG may be calculated using an indirect concentration measurement taking into account the measured concentration values of all other components i of the gas stream, using the following formula:\nGHG conc |%] = 100 %— > Conc,|%]\n(Equation 17)\nWhere:\nconc;\nis the concentration of gas component i.\nB.6.2.3.

Determining CO,e emissions from N,O\nIn the case of N3O measurements, the total annual N,O emissions from all emissions sources, measured in tonnes to three decimal places, shall be converted to annual CO,e in rounded tonnes, using the following formula and the GWP values given in Annex VIII:\nCO>ze [t] = N2Oonnuail t] x GWPy20\n(Equation 18)\nWhere:\nN 2 Oannual\nis the total annual N,O emissions, calculated in accordance with Section B.6.2.1 of this Annex.\nL 228/158\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nB.6.2.5. Determination of flue gas flow\nThe flue gas flow may be determined by one of the following methods:\n—\ncalculation by means of a suitable mass balance, taking into account all significant parameters on the input side, including for CO, emissions at least input material loads, input airflow and process efficiency, and on the output side, including at least the product output and the concentration of oxygen (O,), sulphur dioxide (SO.) and nitrogen oxides (NO,);\n— determination by continuous flow measurement at a representative point.\nB.6.2.6. Treatment of measurement gaps\nWhere the continuous measurement equipment for a parameter is out of control, out of range or out of operation for part of the hour or reference period, the related hourly average shall be calculated pro rata to the remaining data points for that specific hour or shorter reference period, provided that at least 80 % of the maximum number of data points for a parameter are available.\nWhere fewer than 80 % of the maximum number of data points for a parameter are available, the following methods shall be used.\n—\nIn the case of a parameter directly measured as concentration, a substitution value as the sum of an average concentration and twice the standard deviation associated with that average is used, applying the following equation:\nCho = C+20,\nsubst\n=\n(Equation 19)\n\nWhere:\nC\nis the arithmetic mean of the concentration of the specific parameter over the whole reporting period or, where specific circumstances applied when data loss occurred, an appropriate period reflecting the specific circumstances; and is the best estimate of the standard deviation of the concentration of the specific parameter over the whole reporting or, where specific circumstances applied when data loss occurred, an appropriate period reflecting the specific circumstances.\n0,\nWhere the reporting period is not applicable for determining such substitution values due to significant technical changes at the installation, another sufficiently representative timeframe shall be chosen for determining the average and standard deviation, where possible with the duration of at least 6 months.\n— In the case of a parameter other than concentration, substitute values shall be determined through a suitable mass balance model or an energy balance of the process. This model shall be validated by using the remaining measured parameters of the measurement-based methodology and data at regular working conditions, considering a time period of the same duration as the data gap.\nB.6.3. Quality requirements\nAll measurements shall be carried out applying methods based on:\n1. ISO 20181:2023 Stationary source emissions — Quality assurance measuring systems 2 ISO 14164:1999 Stationary source emissions — Determination of the volume flowrate of gas streams in ducts — Automated method ISO 14385-1:2014 Stationary source emissions — Greenhouse gases — Part 1: Calibration of automated measuring systems ISO 14385-2:2014 Stationary source emissions — Greenhouse gases — Part 2: Ongoing quality control of automated measuring systems other relevant ISO standards, in particular ISO 16911-2 (Stationary source emissions — Manual and automatic determination of velocity and volume flow rate in ducts).\nof automated\n15.9.2023\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nWhere no applicable published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best practice guidelines or other scientifically proven methodologies shall be used, limiting sampling and measurement bias.\nAll relevant aspects of the continuous measurement system shall be considered, including the location of the equipment, calibration, measurement, quality assurance and quality control.\nLaboratories carrying out measurements, calibrations and relevant equipment assessments for continuous measurement systems shall be accredited in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 for the relevant analytical methods or calibration activities. Where the laboratory does not have such accreditation, sufficient competence in line with Section B.5.4.3 of this Annex shall be ensured.\nB.6.4. Corroborating calculations\nCO, emissions determined by a measurement-based methodology shall be corroborated by calculating the annual emissions of each greenhouse gas in question for the same emission sources and source streams. For this purpose, the requirements laid down in Sections B.4 to B.6 of this Annex may be simplified as appropriate.\nB.6.5.

Where production processes are defined such that also the production of precursors is included, double counting shall be avoided by counting only the final products leaving the system boundaries of the production process. Any special provisions laid down for the production process or production route in Section 3 of Annex II shall be taken into account. Where several production routes are used at the same installation for producing goods falling under the same CN code, and where those production routes are assigned separate production processes, the embedded emissions of the goods shall be calculated separately for each production route.\nOnly goods which can be sold or directly used as precursor in another production process shall be taken into account. Off- spec products, by-products, waste, and scrap produced in a production process, irrespective of whether they are returned to production processes, delivered to other installations, or disposed of, shall not be included in the determination of the activity level.

For this purpose, either of\nthe following principles shall be applied depending on which principle yields more accurate results:\n(a) where different goods are produced one after the other in the same production line, inputs, outputs, and\ncorresponding emissions shall be attributed sequentially based on the usage time per year for each\nproduction process;\n(b) inputs, outputs, and corresponding emissions shall be attributed based on the mass or volume of individual\ngoods produced or estimates based on the ratio of free reaction enthalpies of the chemical reactions involved\nor based on another suitable distribution key that is corroborated by a sound scientific methodology.\nWhere several measuring instruments of different quality are contributing to measurement results, either of the following methods may be used for splitting installation-level data on quantities of materials, fuels, measurable heat, or electricity to production processes:\n(a) Determination of the split based on a determination method, such as sub-metering, estimate, correlation, used equally for each production process. Where the sum of the production process data is different from the data determined separately for the installation, a uniform ‘reconciliation factor’ is applied for uniform correction to meet the total figure of the installation as follows:\nRecF = Dinst /Z Dpp\n(Equation 55)\nWhere:\nRecF\nis the reconciliation factor; is the data value determined for the installation as a whole; and are the data values for the different production processes.\nDpp\nThe data for each production process are then corrected as follows, with Dpp.o, being the corrected value of Dpp:\nDpPcorr = Dpp x RecF\n(Equation 56)\n(b) If only one production process’s data are unknown or of lower quality than the data of other production processes, known production process data may be subtracted from the total installation data. This method is preferred only for production processes which contribute smaller quantities to the installation’s allocation.\nFor the purpose of correct attribution of data to production processes, the installation shall maintain a list of all goods and precursors produced at the installation as well as of precursors obtained from outside the installation, and their applicable CN codes. Based on this list:\nproducts and their annual production figures shall be attributed to production processes in accordance with the aggregated goods categories provided in Section 2 of Annex II; this information shall be taken into account for attributing inputs, outputs, and emissions separately to production processes.\nMonitoring methods required for attributing emissions to production processes\nF3.1.

Procedure for tracking CN codes of goods and precursors\n15.9.2023\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nTo this end a procedure shall be established, documented, implemented, and maintained for regular checking whether the goods and precursors produced in the installation correspond to the CN codes applied when setting up the monitoring methodology documentation. This procedure shall furthermore contain provisions to identify if the installation produces new goods and to ensure that the applicable CN code for the new product is determined and added it to the list of goods for attributing related inputs, outputs, and emissions to the appropriate production process.\nF4\nFurther rules for the attribution of direct emissions\nEmissions of source streams or emission sources serving only one production process shall be attributed to that production process in full. Where a mass balance is used, outgoing source streams shall be subtracted in accordance with Section B.3.2 of this Annex. For avoiding double counting, source streams which are converted into waste gases, with the exception of waste gases produced and fully consumed within the same production process, shall be attributed using Equations 53 and 54. The necessary monitoring of the NCV and volume of the respective waste gas shall be done by applying the rules given in Sections B.4 and B.5 of this Annex. Only where source streams or emission sources serve more than one production process, the following methods for attribution of direct emissions shall apply: (a) Emissions from source streams or emission sources used for the production of measurable heat shall be attributed to production processes in accordance with Section F.5 of this Annex. (b) Where waste gases are not used within the same production process in which they are produced, the emissions stemming from waste gases shall be attributed in accordance with rules and equations given in Section F.1 of this Annex. (c) Where the amounts of source streams attributable to production processes are determined by metering before the use in the production process, the appropriate methodology shall be applied in accordance with Section F.3.1 of this Annex. (d) Where emissions from source streams or emission sources cannot be attributed in accordance with other methods, they shall be attributed using correlated parameters, which have already been attributed to production processes in accordance with Section F.3.1 of this Annex. For that purpose, source stream amounts and their respective emissions shall be attributed proportionally to the ratio in which those parameters are attributed to production processes. Appropriate parameters include the mass of goods produced, mass or volume of fuel or material consumed, amount of non-measurable heat produced, operating hours, or known equipment efficiencies.\nFurther rules for the attribution of emissions from measurable heat\nE.5.\nThe general calculation principles given in Section F.1 of this Annex shall apply. The relevant heat flows shall be determined in line with Section C.1 of this Annex and the emission factor of measurable heat by applying Section C.2 of this Annex.\nWhere losses of measurable heat are determined separately from the amounts used in production processes, emissions related to these heat losses shall be added proportionally to the emissions of all production processes in which measurable heat produced in the installation is used, in order to ensure that 100 % of the quantity of net measurable heat produced within the installation, or imported or exported by the installation, as well as quantities transferred between production processes, shall be attributed to production processes without any omission or double counting.\nG\n(Equation 57)\nSEE, =\nL 228/177\nCALCULATION OF SPECIFIC EMBEDDED EMISSIONS OF COMPLEX GOODS\nIn accordance with Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the specific embedded emissions SEE, of complex goods g shall be calculated as follows:\nAttrEmg + EE InpMat\nALg\n(Equation 58)\nL 228/178\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nWhere:\nSEE, are the specific direct or indirect embedded emissions of (complex) goods g expressed in t COse per tonne of goods g; AttrEm, are the attributed direct or indirect emissions of the production process yielding goods g determined in accordance with Section F.1 of this Annex for the reporting period, expressed in t CO;e; is the activity level of the production process yielding goods g determined in accordance with Section F.2 of ‘& this Annex for the reporting period, expressed in tonnes; tmpMat are the embedded direct or indirect emissions of all precursors consumed during the reporting period which are defined as relevant for the production process of goods g in Section 3 of Annex II, expressed in t COze; is the mass of precursor i used in the production process yielding g during the reporting period, expressed in tonnes of precursor i; and SEE; are the specific direct or indirect embedded emissions of precursor i expressed in t CO,e per tonne of precursor i.\nAL\nEE\nM;\nIn this calculation, only precursors not covered by the same production process as goods g are taken into account.

In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs’*. Multiple companies and stakeholders have voiced their concerns about the administrative burden resulting from a number of EU acts, including Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM Regulation’).\nIn its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would deliver an unprecedented simplification effort to achieve the agreed policy objectives in the simplest, most targeted, most effective and least burdensome way. In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground, requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules’.\nAdministrative requirements, including reporting requirements, play a key role in ensuring correct enforcement and proper monitoring of legislation. Generally, their costs are largely offset by the benefits they bring. However, reporting requirements can also impose disproportionate burdens on stakeholders, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-companies.\nThis proposal will deliver simplifications and cost-efficient improvements to the CBAM Regulation without affecting the achievement of objectives in this policy area. The proposed measures will not undermine the environmental objective of CBAM, rather the measures will enable a more efficient CBAM while the key design principles of the mechanism will remain unchanged.\nThe proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which rely on complex calculations and data collection processes which would hamper the CBAM’s effective implementation.\nIn addition, the proposal will strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is\nEN\nBudapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, 8 November 2024.\n“The future of European competitiveness”, September 2024.\nRegulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p 52,\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/o}).\nReference to be added when published\nEN\nmaximised. It will also enable the Commission to better detect risks and the national competent authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed\nFinally, simplifying the mechanism will also be a key enabler for a potential future scope extension. In the second half of 2025, the Commission will present a comprehensive CBAM review report as provided in Article 30 of the CBAM regulation, which will pave the way for a potential extension of the CBAM scope\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\ne\nThis proposal is part of a package of measures aiming at simplifying reporting requirements by looking comprehensively at existing requirements, with a view to assess their continued relevance and to make them more efficient. It builds on existing rules from the CBAM Regulation, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the reporting obligations for the transitional period’ and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3210 of 18 December 2024 laying down rules for the CBAM registry\nConsistency with other Union policies\ne\nThe proposal is consistent with the objectives of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while avoiding the costs (both for the Commission and the entities providing the information) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means\n2\nLEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\nLegal basis\ne\nThe proposal amends an existing regulation. Therefore, the legal basis for the proposal is the same as the legal basis of the amended Regulation, namely Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’) in the area of environment protection\nIn accordance with Articles 191 and 192(1) of TFEU, the Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change\nSubsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\ne\nThe CBAM Regulation created a common uniform framework ensuring an equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports\nThe simplifications to that regulation envisaged by this proposal will further enhance legal certainty and rationalise the reporting requirements\n5 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards reporting obligations for the purposes of the carbon border adjustment mechanism during the transitional period (OJ L 228, 15.9.2023, p. 94, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/1773/o}).\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3210 of 18 December 2024 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the CRAM registry (OJ 30.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_imp1/2024/3210/o})\nEN\nEN\ne\nProportionality\nThe simplification of administrative requirements, including reporting requirements, simplifies the legal framework by introducing changes to existing requirements that do not affect the substance of the policy objectives. The proposal is therefore limited to those changes that are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and to ensure compliance in a more efficient manner without changing the substance of the legislation concerned.\nThe proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality as it does not go beyond what is necessary to meet the objectives of the Treaties. The proportionality of the proposal has a number of important aspects.\nFirstly, it is recognised that it is challenging for importers to deal with the CBAM reporting requirements while at the same time Member States’ competent authorities must carry out important supervision tasks. This will be mitigated by introducing a threshold to exempt from CBAM obligations certain importers.\nSecondly, for importers within the CBAM scope, the proposal contains changes to the reporting requirements, targeting those which are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and ensure compliance in a more efficient manner.\nChoice of the instrument\ne\nThe proposal requires amending the CBAM Regulation. It lays down the specific rules necessary for the simplified application of certain provisions of the CBAM Regulation, where the goals pursued cannot be reached through the adoption of implementing measures as they require amending basic provisions of the CBAM Regulation. This concerns the de minimis derogation, the reporting obligations, the calculation of embedded emissions and the calculation of the financial adjustment.\n3\nRESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nSTAKEHOLDER\nEx-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\ne\nThe proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing the CBAM Regulation since the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.\ne\nStakeholder consultations\nSince the CBAM started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023, the Commission Services have continuously been consulting stakeholders in the Union and in third countries relevant for CBAM via multiple communication channels. In 2023, the Commission Services renewed the mandate of the expert group on CBAM’ whose mission is to assist the Commission services in the development and implementation of the CBAM, harness technical expertise and bring exchanges of experience and good practices in CBAM implementation.\nIn 2023, the Commission Services also launched a broad communication campaign to raise awareness about CBAM including in third countries, explain the rules and provide useful advice in how CBAM could be implemented by the relevant stakeholders (such as importers,\n7 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert- groups/consult?lang=en&groupID=3927\nEN\nEN\nthird country producers, national authorities). This communication campaign relied on publicly available live webinars in several EU languages. Useful materials have been provided on the CBAM-dedicated webpage’: targeted e-learning materials, Q&A, guidance (also translated to non-EU official languages).\nThe Commission was also in regular contact with national competent authorities for CBAM, to discuss various issues concerning implementation of CBAM, with a view to improve its functioning and effectiveness.\nOn 6 February 2025, the Commission hosted a high-level consultation day with key stakeholders to test the main ideas of the legislative package on simplification on targeted policies, including the CBAM, and to collect input and feedback ahead of its adoption on 26 February 2025.\nBased on these actions and repeated public meetings with relevant business representatives from the Union and third countries, the Commission Services have collected sufficient feedback from stakeholders to adopt the best measures to achieve the objective of the proposal: simplify the complex reporting rules to reduce the compliance burden and ensure CBAM is efficiently rolled out while preserving its environmental objective and climate objective.\nCollection and use of expertise\ne\nThe proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing reporting obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the data collected through the quarterly CBAM report submitted by declarants. Since this is a step in the process of continuous assessment of reporting requirements in Union legislations, the scrutiny of such burdens and of their impact on stakeholders will continue in the future.\nImpact assessment\ne\nThe proposal concerns targeted changes of the CBAM Regulation to simplify some of its requirements, including reporting. The main measures are based on experience in implementing this Regulation and abovementioned related implementing acts. The proposed targeted changes ensure a more efficient and effective implementation of the existing mechanism.\nThis proposal is accompanied by an analytical document, the Commission Staff Working Document (SWD) “Towards a simpler and more effective Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism”. The analytical document builds on and further complements the analysis carried out in the original impact assessment conducted in 2021.\nRegulatory fitness and simplification\ne\nIn the 2021 impact assessment accompanying the CBAM legislative proposal'®, the Commission concluded that, since CBAM is initially applied to imports of selected basic materials and their products, large businesses would be the primary ones affected, but that in practice the CBAM would result in relatively higher compliance costs for small and medium-\nhttps://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en XXX SWD(2021) 643 final.\n10\nEN\nEN\nsized enterprises (SMEs) compared to large enterprises in scope of CBAM, e.g. those importing CBAM goods above the derogation.\nBased on the experience in implementing CBAM in its transitional phase, and on the assessment of stakeholders’ feedback since 1 October 2023, it has become clear that CBAM requires two types of main simplifications: a broader derogation from CBAM requirements of importers of very small quantities of CBAM goods, and a set of simplifications for the rest of the importers of CBAM goods to facilitate their compliance with the administrative requirements.\nThe proposed simplification is expected to exempt around 90% of importers from CBAM obligations, while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in scope of CBAM, thereby safeguarding the environmental nature of the mechanism.\nFundamental rights\ne\nThe proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter.\n4\nBUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThis proposal will have implications for the EU budget. Its impact is assessed in the legislative financial and digital statement accompanying this proposal.\n5\nOTHER ELEMENTS\nImplementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\ne\nAs the proposal amends the CBAM Regulation, it does not have additional implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements beyond the existing ones under the said Regulation.\nIt is however important to recall that the Commission will continue ensuring that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM, including its enforcement against circumvention practices, and evaluate it against the main policy objectives. Given that the CBAM is one of the policy proposals under the ‘Fit for 55 Package’ adopted by the Commission in July 2021'', monitoring and evaluation will be carried out in alignment with the other policies of the package.\nThe Commission will monitor how CBAM is implemented to feed into its analysis and will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of the CBAM Regulation. As part of that reporting, the Commission will propose possible changes to improve its functioning, collect the necessary information for a potential further extension of the scope of CBAM, including on other goods that could be at risk of carbon leakage, such as downstream products. Those reports should also contain an assessment of the impact of the CBAM on carbon leakage, including in relation to exports, and its economic, environmental, social and territorial impact throughout the Union.\n11\nCOM(2020) 690 final.\nEN\nEN\nDetailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\ne\nThe proposal contains two types of simplifications.\nFirst, importers of small quantities of CBAM goods, which represent very small quantities of embedded emissions imported into the Union and in most cases correspond to SMEs and individuals, will be exempt from CBAM obligations. For those importers, the administrative burden resulting from compliance with CBAM obligations significantly outweighs the environmental and regulatory benefit. This is due to the combination of (1) the insignificant share of embedded emissions in all their CBAM goods imported into the Union and (ii) the inability of national authorities to enforce the rules due to the large numbers of importers of small quantities of CBAM goods.\nSecond, the proposal contains a set of simplifications for importers of CBAM goods above the threshold to facilitate their compliance with the reporting requirements. In particular, the proposal simplifies and streamlines the authorisation procedure for national competent authorities and the Commission, the data collection processes from third country producers to authorised CBAM declarants, the calculation of embedded emissions for certain goods, the emission verification rules, the calculation of the authorised CBAM declarants’ financial liability during the year of imports into the EU and the claim by authorised CBAM declarants for carbon prices paid in third countries where goods are produced.\nArticle 1(1) amends the derogation from the CBAM obligations by introducing a new mass threshold as laid out in a new Annex VII to the CBAM Regulation, to exclude importers of very small quantities of goods.\nArticle 1(2) amends the definitions of importer and operator to facilitate reporting requirements.\nArticles 1(3) and 1(4), point (b), draw the consequences of the new threshold on the rules related to the authorisation that importers must be granted to import goods above that threshold, and provide for the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants, which remain legally responsible of their CBAM obligations, to technically delegate in the CBAM Registry the reporting requirements to third parties to facilitate compliance.\nArticles 1(4)(a) changes the annual deadline for submitting the annual CBAM declaration.\nArticle 1(4)(c) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to claim a carbon price paid in a third country other than the country of origin.\nArticles 1(4), point (d), and 1(6) amend the rules on emission verification so that the obligation to verify embedded emissions only applies to actual values.\nArticle 1(5) amends the calculation of embedded emissions in the case of relevant input materials (precursors).\nArticle 1(7) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to use default carbon prices calculated and made available by the Commission and claim carbon prices paid in third countries other than the country of origin of the goods.\nArticle 1(8) facilitates reporting obligations by introducing several changes to the portal established pursuant to Article 10 to register operators and installations in third countries.\nEN\nEN\nArticle 1(9) creates the registration of accredited verifiers so they can access the CBAM registry and carry out certain relevant tasks to facilitate reporting obligations.\nArticle 1(10) strengthens the empowerment Member States give to their national competent authority to carry out the CBAM-related duties and responsibilities.\nArticles 1(11) and 1(13) draw the consequences of the changes introduced by this proposal on the requirements applying on the CBAM registry, risk analysis and monitoring.\nArticle 1(12) streamlines the consultation of other competent authorities and the Commission to reduce excessive administrative burden.\nArticle 1(14) sets the start date of the sales of CBAM certificates to February 2027 to address significant uncertainties related to the year 2026, which is the first year of the post-transitional period, and streamlines the information exchanges between the CBAM registry and the common central platform.\nArticles 1(15) and 1(18) draw the consequences of the move of certificate sales to 2027 on the determination of the financial adjustment for the year 2026.\nArticle 1(16) simplifies the calculation as from 2027 by authorised CBAM declarants of their expected financial liability during the year of imports.\nArticle 1(17) modifies the repurchase limit to facilitate the way authorised CBAM declarant may manage their CBAM financial liability and draws the consequence of the change of the CBAM declaration submission annual deadline.\nArticles 1(19) modifies the scope of information exchanged with customs authorities, the competent authorities and the Commission to reflect the introduction of the derogation.\nArticles 1(20) and 1(22) introduce the rules and information exchanges on the monitoring of the derogation.\nArticle 1(21) introduces the possibility for competent authorities to modulate the penalty based on relevant facts and circumstances and draws the consequences of the new derogation.\nArticle 1(23) amends the empowerments given to the Commission by the co-legislators to adopt delegated acts in light of the simplifications made by this proposal.\nArticle 1(24) complements the reporting by the Commission to the co-legislators with the application of the derogation as amended by this proposal.\nArticle 1(25) amends the list of CBAM goods to exclude non-calcined kaolinic clays.\nArticle 1(26) adds electricity to the list of CBAM goods for which only direct emissions are to be taken into account in the calculation of the embedded emissions.\nArticle 1(27) amends Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to exclude input materials which have been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.\nArticle 1(28) introduces a new Annex VII to set the threshold referred to in Article 1(1) point (b).\nEN\nEN\nFinally, the Annexes contain several simplifications of embedded emission calculation to facilitate reporting obligations, for instance in the case of default values or precursors produced in the EU.\nEN\nEN\n2025/0039 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee!”,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 13 bd\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1) During the transitional period, which started on 1 October 2023, the Commission has been collecting data and information on the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (“CBAM’) as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council'*, including through the analysis of quarterly reports submitted by reporting declarants. The information collected and the exchanges with the stakeholders, including as part of the expert group on the CBAM, have outlined possibilities for simplifications and improvement of the CBAM. The Union is committed to ensure a smooth roll-out of the CBAM during the post- transitional period starting on | January 2026. (2) Based on the experience acquired and data collected during the transitional period, the distribution of importers of CBAM goods into the Union shows that only a small proportion of importers accounts for the vast majority of embedded emissions in those goods. The derogation applied to the importation of goods of negligible value referred to in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 (consignments of a value below EUR 150) appears insufficient to ensure that the CBAM applies to importers in proportion to their impact on emissions covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For those importers of small quantities of goods, compliance with CBAM reporting and financial obligations could be unduly burdensome. Furthermore, as part of the 2023 12 OJC,,p.. 13 OJC,,p.. 14 Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, Pp 52, ELT: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/o}).\nEN\nEN\nCustoms reform package, the Commission proposed to remove this derogation’. Therefore, a new derogation should be introduced to exempt importers of small quantities in terms of mass of CBAM goods from CBAM obligations, while preserving the environmental objective of that mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective. (3) A new threshold based on cumulative mass per importer per year should be introduced in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, ensuring that more than 99% of emissions are maintained in scope. This is a robust and targeted approach as it accurately reflects the environmental nature of the CBAM by taking into account all imported emissions over a period of time in determining the threshold. It also eliminates the risk of circumvention through the artificial splitting of consignments by a single importer. (4) A mass-based threshold reflecting the average emissions intensity of the volume of imported CBAM goods would better translate the climate objective of the CBAM. A single mass-based threshold applying cumulatively to all CBAM goods in the iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement sectors imported by importers during a calendar year is the simplest design for importers, as they will not have to obtain or provide any data additional to those provided in the customs declaration, thereby reducing substantially any CBAM-related administrative burden for these importers. A threshold set at a level of 50 tonnes will exempt the vast majority of importers from obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM. To establish the threshold, a new Annex VII should be introduced. (5) The main principles governing the threshold, including ensuring that nearly all embedded emissions remain in the scope of the CBAM, should be laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to provide legal certainty. Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should also provide for the possibility to re-calculate the threshold on the basis of updated average emission intensities of imported goods or significant changes in trade patterns or practices of circumvention affecting the coverage of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM. (6) To ensure that the derogation is sufficiently targeted, it should apply to the importer. The indirect customs representative, due to the nature of its activity and the related obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, should always be required to obtain an authorisation. (7) The competent authorities and the Commission should — based on customs information — monitor the quantities of goods imported to assess compliance with the threshold. To allow the competent authorities to make an informed decision, the customs authorities and the Commission should make the necessary information and data available to the competent authorities. Where the competent authority concludes that an importer has exceeded the threshold, it should communicate that information to the customs authorities who, in turn, should not allow further importation of goods from that importer until the end of the calendar year, or until that importer has obtained the status of authorised CBAM declarant.\n15 Proposal for COUNCIL REGULATION amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 regards the a as introduction of a simplified tariff treatment for the distance sales of goods and Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 as regards the elimination of the customs duty relief threshold (COM(2023) 259 final.\nEN\nEN\nWhere an importer expects to exceed the annual threshold or intends to import goods\nafter exceeding the threshold, the importer should apply for authorisation pursuant to\nArticle 5 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For importers who have not been granted the\nauthorisation before exceeding the threshold, penalties should apply for the entirety of\nthe imported goods in accordance with Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.\nThe payment of the penalty in accordance with Article 26(2) of that Regulation should\nrelease the importer from the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration and to\nsurrender CBAM certificates.\nTo ensure that the definition of an importer covers all relevant customs procedures, it\nis necessary to amend it to include the case of the simplified customs procedure where\nonly a bill of discharge is submitted pursuant to Article 175(5) of Commission\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446'°.\n(10) To strike a balance between the effectiveness of the authorisation procedure and the\nrisk profile of the applicants, the consultation procedure should be optional for the\ncompetent authority. The consultation procedure should allow the competent authority\nto consult other competent authorities and the Commission when considered necessary\nbased on the information submitted by the applicant and customs information made\navailable in the CBAM registry.\n(11) To provide additional flexibility, the authorised CBAM declarants should be able to\ndelegate the submission of the CBAM declaration to a third party. The authorised\nCBAM declarant should remain liable for the submission of the CBAM declaration.\nTo provide the required delegation and access, that third party should fulfil certain\ntechnical credentials, including holding an Economic Operators Registration and\nIdentification (EORI) number and being established in a Member State.\n(12) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit their annual CBAM declaration\nand surrender the corresponding number of certificates by 31 May of the year\nfollowing the year of import. In order to provide authorised CBAM declarants\nflexibility to comply with their obligations, a later date of submission would provide\nauthorised CBAM declarants more time to collect the necessary information, ensure\nthat embedded emissions are verified by an accredited verifier, and purchase the\ncorresponding number of CBAM certificates. The date for the cancellation of CBAM\ncertificates should be adjusted accordingly.\n(13) The embedded emissions of some aluminium and steel goods currently included in the\nscope of CBAM are primarily determined by the embedded emissions of input\nmaterials (precursors), while the emissions arising during the production steps of those\ngoods are typically relatively low. They consist of finishing processes that are carried\nout by separate installations not covered by the EU emissions trading system (‘EU\nETS’) as provided for in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil!’, except for the case of integrated facilities. The embedded emissions of\nthose production processes should be excluded from the system boundaries of the\ncalculation of emissions.\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 of 28 July 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code (OJ L 343, 29.12.2015 Pp I, ELT:\nhttp://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2015/2446/oj).\n17\nDirective 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2003/87/o}).\n(8)\n(9)\n16\nEN\nEN\n(14) Where input materials (precursors) have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS, the embedded emissions of those precursors should not be accounted for in the calculation of the embedded emissions of complex goods. (15) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values or actual values verified by accredited verifiers. Default values will be calculated and made available by the Commission. Therefore, the verification of embedded emissions should only apply to actual values. (16) Information collected during the transitional period illustrates difficulties for reporting declarants to obtain the required information on the carbon price effectively paid in a third country. To facilitate the deduction of the carbon price, the Commission should, where possible, establish an annual average carbon price expressed in EUR/tCOze of the effective carbon price paid, based on the best available data from reliable, publicly available information and information provided by third countries, including on a conservative basis. (17) Authorised CBAM declarants may claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions. Since the carbon price may be paid in a third country other than the country of origin of the imported goods, such carbon price should also be eligible for deduction. (18) To improve the reliability of the emissions data contained in the CBAM registry and to facilitate the submission of data, accredited verifiers should be allowed to access the CBAM registry to verify the embedded emissions upon request from an operator in third countries. In addition, parent companies or related undertakings of those operators should be allowed to access the CBAM registry for the purpose of registering and sharing relevant data on behalf of the controlled operator. The operators should be required to provide a corporate or activity registration number to ensure their identification. (19) To foster the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 at national level, Member States should ensure that the competent authorities have the necessary powers to perform their duties. (20) To provide authorised CBAM declarants sufficient time to prepare for compliance with the amended obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Member States should start selling CBAM certificates in 2027 for emissions embedded in goods imported during the year 2026. The price of CBAM certificates, purchased in 2027 and corresponding to emissions embedded in goods imported into the EU in 2026, should reflect the prices of EU ETS allowances in 2026. (21) The obligation for the authorised CBAM declarants to ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year, is insufficiently tailored to the expected financial adjustment. It is therefore necessary to both reduce the ratio from 80 % to 50 % and integrate the free allocation of EU ETS allowances. Furthermore, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to rely on the information submitted in the CBAM declaration in the previous year, for the same goods and third countries.\nEN\nEN\n(22) The repurchase limit should likewise align more accurately with the number of CBAM certificates which the authorised CBAM declarants are required to purchase during the year of imports. (23) Since CBAM certificates are cancelled without any compensation, there is no need for an exchange of information from the common central platform to the CBAM registry at the end of the working day. (24) The competent authorities, when applying penalties, should be able to take into account the specific circumstances such as the intentional or negligent behaviour of the declarant. That would allow for a reduction of the amount of the penalty where minor or unintentional errors are made. (25) The CBAM applies to certain carbon-intensive goods imported into the Union. The list of CBAM goods in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 includes ‘[o]ther kaolinic clays’ in the list of cement goods. While calcined kaolinic clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non-calcined kaolinic clays. Non-calcined kaolinic clays should therefore be excluded from the scope of the CBAM. (26) Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lists the goods for which only direct emissions should be taken into account in the calculation of embedded emissions. For goods not listed in that Annex, both direct and indirect emissions should be taken into account. Since indirect emissions are not relevant in the case of electricity generation, electricity should be added to the list of goods in that Annex. (27) It is also necessary to simplify the means for determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country would not be available for a certain type of goods. In such cases, to prevent carbon leakage, the default value should be set at the level of the average emission intensity of the ten exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data is available, which is an appropriate average to ensure the environmental objective of the CBAM. This is without prejudice to the possibility to adapt these default values based on region-specific features pursuant to point 7 of Annex IV of the CBAM. (28) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the threshold in Annex VII to that Regulation, where necessary, as determined in accordance with Article 2(3a) of that Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making*. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. * Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making, Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making, (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1-14, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/agree_interinstit/2016/51 2/0} (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, namely simplifying certain obligations and strengthening the mechanism that\nthe Union has adopted to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global\ncarbon emissions but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be\nEN\nEN\nbetter achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(30) Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) 2023/956\nRegulation (EU) 2023/956 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nArticle 2 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n(2)\n‘3.

General objective(s)\n1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact\nEN\nPolicy area(s) concerned\nClimate policy\nObjective(s)\nIn light of the EU’s increased climate ambitions, the introduction of a CBAM has the\noverarching objective of addressing climate change by reducing GHG emissions in\nthe EU and globally.\nThe amending proposal aims at simplifying the compliance burden on importers of\nCBAM goods.\nThe overarching objective of addressing climate change is further articulated in a number of specific objectives, namely: (i) Addressing the risk of carbon leakage under increased EU ambition. (ii) Contributing to the provision of a stable and secure policy framework for investments in low or zero carbon technologies. (111) Ensuring that domestic production and imports are subject to similar level of carbon pricing. (iv) Encouraging producers in third countries who export to the EU to adopt low carbon technologies. (v) Ensuring that the measure is effective, minimising the risk of being circumvented, thus providing environmental integrity. (vi) Ensuring a proportionate administrative burden for businesses and public authorities in the application of the measure.\nThe amending proposal aims at: (i) reducing administrative burden; (ii) improving the functioning of CBAM.\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThe introduction of a CBAM envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions both in the EU-27 and in the rest of the world in the sectors covered by CBAM. The CBAM is also expected to reduce the risks of carbon leakage, therefore gradually replacing the free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS.\nAs regards economic impacts, the modelling conducted before the adoption of the CBAM Regulation indicated that the introduction of a CBAM and other measures needed to reach the EU’s increased climate ambitions could lead to a GDP contraction for the EU 27 by 0.22 % to 0.23 % in 2030. Impact on the investment side is modest. On the consumption side CBAM appears to have a slightly stronger negative effect relative to the scenario of increased climate ambition and no CBAM.\nBy effectively reducing carbon leakage, the introduction of a CBAM leads to a reduction in imports in the EU 27. Overall, the social impacts of CBAM are limited.\nAdministrative impacts on the Commission, businesses national authorities, are expected. Altogether, compliance costs for businesses and authorities, while\n1.3.2. Specific objective(s)\nEN\n22\nsignificant, are expected to be proportionate, and manageable in light of the environmental benefits of the measure. While revenue generation is not an objective of CBAM is expected to generate additional revenue, which for 2030 is estimated at above EUR [2.1 billion to be updated].\nThe amending proposal expects to:\n(1) reduce the number of entities subject to CBAM obligations while preserving the environmental integrity of the mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective;\n(11) enhance the functioning of the mechanism by simplifying and streamlining processes and procedures. The proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which relate to complex calculations or rely on hazardous data collection processes which hamper effective CBAM implementation.\nIn addition, the proposal will also strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is maximised. It will also enable both the Commission to better detect risks and national authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed.\n1.3.4. Indicators of performance\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.\n1.4\n1.5\n1.5.1.\nExempt from CBAM obligations importers of small quantities of CBAM goods\nOptimisation of processes to increase effectiveness and reduce administrative burden\nThe proposal/initiative relates to:\nOa new action\nOa new action following a pilot project / preparatory action’\nthe extension of an existing action\nCa merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action\nGrounds for the proposal/initiative\nRequirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative\nThe CBAM was introduced from October 2023. A simplified system of the CBAM scheme is currently in place until the end of 2025. Specifically, a transitional period (dry-run for data collection) currently applies to facilitate the smooth roll out of the CBAM and allow traders and importers to adjust.\nCommission services are in charge of implementing and enforcing CBAM both during the transition period (2023-2025) and will also be during the definitive phase (from 2026).\n18\nAs referred in Article 58(2), point (a) (b) of the Financial Regulation.\nto\nor\nEN\n23\nEN\nDuring the transition period this implies collecting information from importers of CBAM goods in the EU on the embedded GHG emissions of these goods and analysing data.\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) calls for a progressive introduction of the different functions necessary for its effective implementation. Firstly, a number of reports and reviews need to be prepared in order to facilitate the financial obligation to be set in place. Recognizing this, the CBAM regulation foresees its implementation in two consecutive periods: the Transitional Period from October 2023 until end of 2025 and the Definitive Period as from early 2026.\nDuring the Transitional Period the obligation placed on importers and the EU Authorities (customs) is limited to the filing of the quarterly CBAM reports in addition of the Import declarations.\nDuring the transitional period, transitional information management system (CBAM Transitional Period - CBAM TP) were put in place to support the submission and collection of quarterly reports, as well as the assimilation of data from each report into an aggregated database, to allow for their effective analysis for the purposes of reporting in line with the provisions of the Regulation.\nAdditionally, during the transitional period, customs authorities are tasked with informing customs declarants of the obligation to report information, so as to contribute to the gathering of information as well as to the awareness on the need to request the status of authorised declarant when applicable (before the first importation of CBAM goods from 1 January 2026).\nThe Definitive Period is planned to start on the 01.01.26 for the core CBAM declaration and certificates management services as listed here and one year earlier for authorised declarants registration and processing of CBAM authorisations by the competent authorities:\n- importers are only entitled to import these goods after they have been granted an authorisation (except in case of the derogation proposed in the amending Regulation) by competent authorities, or if they would appoint a representative authorised as CBAM declarant. Customs authorities should not allow the importation of CBAM goods without a authorised CBAM declarant being involved. Furthermore, the customs authorities may carry out checks on the goods, including with respect to the identification of the authorised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the country of origin of the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks relating to CBAM in the design of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013\n- The CBAM should be based on a declarative system where an authorised CBAM declarant, who may act on its own behalf or represent one or more importers, submits annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported to the customs territory of the Union and surrenders a number of CBAM certificates corresponding to those declared emissions.\n- An authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid for those emissions in other jurisdictions. The amending Regulation proposes to introduce a default carbon price which would allow\nEN\n24\nEN\ndeclarants to claim a deduction where it cannot be demonstrated that a carbon price has been effectively paid.\n- The embedded declared emissions should be verified by a person accredited by an EU national accreditation body where actual emissions are declared.\n- The CBAM central system should allow operators of production installations in third countries to register in the CBAM registry and to make their verified embedded GHG emissions from production of goods available to authorised CBAM declarants. The Commission should manage the CBAM registry containing data on the authorised CBAM declarants, operators and installations in third countries. The amending Regulation proposes to allow accredited verifiers to access the registry to improve the reliability of emission data shared by operators with declarants through the registry.\n- To reduce the risk of carbon leakage the Commission should take action to address practices of circumvention\n- For the sale and re-purchase of CBAM certificates a common central platform should be established. For the purpose of oversight of the transactions on the common central platform, the Commission should facilitate the exchanges of information and the cooperation between competent authorities, and between those authorities and the Commission. Additionaly, a swift flow of information between the common central platform and the CBAM registry should be establised.\n- The Commission should carry out risk-based controls and should review the content of the CBAM declarations accordingly. For enforcement purposes, Member States may also carry out reviews of individual CBAM declarations. The conclusions of the reviews of individual CBAM declarations should be shared with the Commission and should be made available to other competent authorities in the CBAM registry.\n- Member States should be responsible for the correct establishment and collection of revenues arising from the application of this Regulation.\nTherefore, during the definitive period the number of tasks attributed to the EC increase drastically, requiring an increase in staffing needs. The tasks carried out by this team will include the supervision of authorisation of CBAM declarants made by MS competent authorities, the management of the central database and central registry, coordination and information exchange with MS competent authorities, review of declarations and oversight of the external platform and lastly, tasks requiring legal competencies such as litigation and recovery and _ financial responsibility oversight. The structure of the team is further defined below.\nDuring the definitive period the Commission will be in charge of the majority of the tasks resulting from the CBAM regulation.\nCBAM IT Budget\nThe CBAM Budget to be engaged/ committed for the period 2023-2027 have been assessed at 101,74 M€.The CBAM IT budget encompasses Analysis & Development services, Deployment services, Operations services, cloud services and/or on premises hardware and software licenses for the Transitional and Definitive CBAM System as detailed below :\n- The CAPEX cost has been estimated based on the actual budget engaged and the budget authorised by EC IT Corporate Governance in the form of approved Vision\nEN\n25\nEN\nTasks attributed to the\nEuropean Commission Transitio Transitio Transitio Definiti Definiti\nand shared with MS for\nthe implementation of Period\nnal\nnal\nnal\nve\nve\nPeriod\nPeriod\nPeriod Period\nCBAM\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\nAuthorisation\na\nCBAM declarants\nManagement\nregistration\nof\ninformation in the\ncentral database of\ninstallations outside\nthe EU\nManagement\ncentral\nincluding\n(Surrendering\ncertificates, including\n80%\nrule,\ncancellation\nCoordination\ninformation exchange\nbetween\nthe\ncompetent authorities\nand customs\nCheck and control for po FE\nirregularities\nDocuments for the following past projects of DG TAXUD IT projects, due to their similarities in terms of IT Architecture Model: CDS, CRMS2, SURV3, REX, CSRD2, EBTI, Customs Trans-European Declaration Management Systems developed and operated by DG TAXUD.\n- The OPEX cost has been assessed on the basis of the current annual infrastructure and operational costs of DG TAXUD, their provisions for IT infrastructure, IT Support and Service Desk activities for the production systems delivered by the projects referenced above.\n- The pricing is based on the current Framework Contracts pricing in place.\nIn the IT Policy budget line, the budget of the joint procurement between the COM and MS of the platform for buying and selling of certificates for managing operations is not included.\nThe CBAM team would consist of 90 EC staff (including 15 IT staff) in 2027.\nThe amending Regulation proposes to introduce rationalisations of administrative requirements, including reporting. Since those requirements were introduced by Union Law, their rationalization is also best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency of reporting. This change corresponds to additional IT cost of 18,95 ME for the period of 2025-2027. This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.\nand Sante\nof tf\nregistry\naccounts\nof\nand Sanae\nEN\nEN\n26\nRisk-based controls ii\nand maintenance of\nindependent\nan\ntransaction log and\ninform\nMS\nof\nirregularities\nOversight and review lI\nof declarations and\nemission reports:\n1 Oversight of the\nautomated step\nof\nchecking\nthrough\nthe\ndeclarations\nReview\ndeclarations\n(embedded\nemissions\ncalculations,\nobligations of\ncertificates,\ndeduction\nof\ncarbon\nprice\npaid\nabroad\nand FA)\n+ Assessment of\nunsubmitted\nCBAM\ncertificates\n3\nReview\n-\n10\n10\nemissions reports\nSetting up risk-based eof\nyy\nfactors for the review\nof the declarations\npO 2\nPenalties\nOversight, monitoring Saaat\nand management of\nthe external platform\nfor buying and selling\nand calculation of\nprice\nof\nCBAM\ncertificates\nReview and reporting Saas\nobligations by the end\nof the transitional\nperiod\nincluding\nassessment\nof\ntransitional\nperiod\nEN\nEN\nof\n27\nreports |\n[3 |Reportstobedrafted\n[31333\n[Litigation andrecovery|3_ 1336\nFinancial responsibility re\neee\noversight\na\nDrafting of secondary | |\nty\nlegislation\n(Implementing\nand\nDelegated Acts\nOutreach Methodology and Training for }2\n2\nfe\nede 2\net\nty\ncalculating embedded\nEmissions\nThe breaking down of total staff, including IT staff, from 2023 to 2027 would be the\nYear Se\n| 2023\n2006\npeep\noP FP\n2027\na\na\nThe strategic importance, the magnitude and complexity of the CBAM IT project require a dedicated CBAM IT team to be established to manage the overall project implementation and operations\nThe CBAM IT team consists of 15 members of specialised IT profiles for defining and managing CBAM IT System Architecture and Project Organisation and planning, the activities in terms of development, deployment, the organisation of the Service Model, the management of operations and support in front of Trade, COM services, climatic and Customs authorities in parallel of the Transitional and definitive CBAM IT systems\nThe CBAM IT team would consist of 15 EC staff structured as presented in the graph below\nEN\n28\nEN\nBAM\nAM AY\nCusto\nperat\nAM\nBAM\nBAME\nage\nBAM\nerat\nEN\nThe proposed plan deploying the CBAM IT team is the\n2023 = |\n2027,\nYear\nNo\na\nResources\nCC\nCe Ee CC\nCe\n2006 Tone\n1.5.2 Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors e.§. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ‘added value of EU involvement’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone\nReasons for action at EU level (ex-ante) Reducing GHG emissions is fundamentally a trans-boundary issue that requires effective action at the largest possible scale. The\n29\nEN\nEU as a supranational organisation is well-placed to establish effective climate policy in the EU, like it has done with the EU ETS.\nThere exists already a harmonised carbon price at EU level. This consists of the price resulting from the EU ETS for the sectors covered by the system. The only meaningful way to ensure equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports is to take action at the level of the Union.\nAny initiative needs to be implemented in a way that provides importers, regardless of country of origin and port of entry or destination within the EU, with uniform conditions and incentives for GHG emission reductions that are equivalent to those of domestic producers. The single effective way to do this is by taking action at the level of the EU.\nThe proposed simplification introduced by the amending Regulation is best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency. This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.\nExpected generated EU added value (ex-post) In parallel to the EU ETS, reduction of GHG emissions and protection against the risk of carbon leakage in the EU single market can be established most adequately at the EU level. Additionally, the need for minimal administrative costs is best achieved by establishing consistent rules for the entire single market, further underlining the added value of an intervention at the EU level.\nThe public consultation has confirmed the added value of taking action on the CBAM at the EU level. In particular, stakeholders agree that an EU CBAM is needed due to existing differences of ambition between the EU and the rest of the world and in order to support the global climate efforts. In addition, in view of the EU’s position in international trade, if it introduces a CBAM the environmental effect on international climate ambitions will be most effective as a potential example to follow.\nThus, the objective of reducing emissions and climate neutrality requires — without equally ambitious global policies — action by the European Union.\n1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n1.5.4.\nThe CBAM is a new mechanism. The preferred option in the Impact Assessment\ndraws from the EU Emissions Trading System and aims at replicating some of its\nfeatures.\nIf sufficient ressources are not made available to enforce CBAM correctly, there is a\nserious risk that businesses will avoid CBAM.\nThe amending proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing CBAM\nsince the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.\nCompatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments\nIn the interinstitutonal agreement of 16 December 2020, signed in the context of the negotiations, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that \"the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the\nEN\n30\nEN\nrepayment\" of NextGenerationEU. As part of the mandate received, the Commission was invited to put forward a proposal for a CBAM in the first semester of 2021.\nThe final agreement by co-legislators foresees that most of the implementation and enforcement of CBAM will be the responsibility of the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure the correct deployment of the proposal the appropriate financing means need to be made available within the current MFF.\nThe amending proposal is consistent with the objective of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while reducing administrative the costs (notably for small importers, but also for Member States’ authorities) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means.\n1.5.5.

The 2025 report will also review the scope of the CBAM to examine the possibility of extending it to cover emissions of other EU ETS sectors at risk of carbon leakage, products further down the value chain as well indirect emissions for all sectors. For this, it is necessary to monitor the effect of CBAM on the shortlisted sectors.\nManagement and control system(s)\nJustification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed\nA significantly centralised set-up allows a very uniform and efficient implementation of CBAM across the EU including in Member states with more limited administrative capacity on climate issues. The majority of the implementation and enforcement functions have been attributed to Commission services. These also require an increased number of control functions in order to ensure the correct implementation and management of the CBAM. The Commission has also foreseen an increased number of measures for fraud prevention.\nWhile this simplification package will significantly reduce the administrative burden for importers, notably SMEs, as well as national authorities, this is made possible by Commission services taking up increased responsibilities and more tasks, notably in the monitoring and enforcement.\n2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them\nThe CBAM will be based on a declarative system, which entails the risk of non- declaration or misdeclaration.\nIn order to address the risk of non-declaration, the system requires an authorisation before importing goods in the scope of the Regulation. National Customs Authorities will be in charge of enforcing this rule by not releasing into free circulation these goods as long as the declarant is not authorised according to this Regulation.\nIn order to address the risk of misdeclaration a system of auditing on risk assessment criteria as well as random audits will be in place coupled with sanctions set up as a sufficiently high level to serve as deterrent. Auditing will take place both at the level of CBAM declaration by the national authorities and at the level of import declarations by customs authorities.\n2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)\nCommission services will control the correct application of CBAM, in particular the surrender of CBAM certificates and the correct application of the de minimis\nEN\n34\nEN\n2.3\nthreshold. A strong risk management system will be applied to ensure cost-effective controls and tackle risks of circumvention.\nMeasures to prevent fraud and irregularities\nThe financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties.\nEfficient anti-fraud actions require active cooperation, including knowledge-sharing and exchange of information, between customs authorities and competent authorities, both at national level and EU level; it may also require cooperation with third countries. A specific attention should be drawn to non-reliable economic operators (e.g. shell company, missing traders) and cross-border trade inside the EU.\nQuick anti-fraud action should be put in place to react to new/newly detected fraud risks. Authorities in charge should report and share knowledge on fraudulent patterns.\nWhere an authorised CBAM declarant or an importer fails to comply with the obligations in the CBAM regulation, penalties will be applied.

In addition, 2M are needed on an annual basis to cover studies including to assess regularly the effectiveness of the CBAM as well as outreach activities, including external communication and training sessions with stakeholders These costs were not covered in the previous LFS.

These were applied on revenue estimates from the Commission’s 2021 impact assessment, which stood at approximately EUR 2.1 billion in 2030. Since less than 1% of emissions would not be captured under the new de minimis threshold, the foregone implied revenue for the year 2030 due to emissions not captured is estimated at approximately EUR 21,000,000.\nDIGITAL DIMENSIONS\nThere are not changes in that Digital concepts and architecture approved by CBAM Definitive system project charter, in terms of digital requirements, data used, digital solution, reusability assessment and Measures to support digital implementation.\nThe only change is related to the Risk management, Circumvention monitoring which was analyse and assessed and included in Project charter as place holder but not included in the Project Charter estimates. The key objective of the Risk management component is supporting detection of the irregularities and limiting the risk of fraud\nAlso, the simplification changes do not result in a change of the digital solution architecture, however, requires additional budget to implement the change to features and services already build by CBAM.\n4.1\nRequirements of digital relevance\nA\nA\nCBAM\n3rd\nOperators\nXK\nA\nEc\nNCA\nOther Authorities\nDeclarant Countries Users Users (Customs/OLAF/Other\nEC services)\nCBAM Definitive System\nCBAM Common\nE=4\n[rent _]\nExc!\n|\nEnforcement\nInformation\nAs shown in diagram abvoe the CBAM Registry gets import information for the CBAM , goods from the EU Customs systems either from the MS or via DG TAXUD, along with the importers customs identification and the Customs classification of the imported goods. The CBAM system makes in return the CBAM authorisations of the CBAM Declarants available to the National Customs Import Systems to enforce the CBAM regulation at the import clearance of the CBAM goods. The CBAM Information system exchanges as well risk management information with the EU Customs systems. The interface with the EU Customs Systems is a vital feed for the operation of CBAM as the whole concept of CBAM is to avoid double capture of information by requesting the CBAM Declarants to complement their imports with a report of the emission incurred during their production in third Countries. The “data provided once” is a basic principle of CBAM.\nCBAM will also interact with the new CBAM Mechanism (IT systems or other means) of the National Competent Authorities to foster the integration of the national CBAM enforcement processes across the MS and the national processes for the collection of penalties and recovery information.\nAnother key new external system for CBAM is the Common Central Platform (CCP), the Information System by which the CBAM Declarants will purchase the CBAM certificates from the Member States. The price of the certificates will be set by the allowance price\nImport\nInward\nitd\nCee\nSee\n|e | ||\nwhe EU CSW\nCERTEX\nPricing of National\nSees Seed\nEmissions Competent Reference\nEN\nEN\n46\ndefined in the ETS system. The CBAM Declarants will need to keep their CBAM accounts in an 80% balance on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are in position to surrender the required number of certificates for offsetting their declared emissions and emission prices already paid in third Countries. The Commission will re-purchase the surplus certificates from the CBAM Declarants in name of the Member States. The Commission and the Member States must jointly establish and manage this platform, which is however outside the scope of the CBAM Registry. The interface with the CCP is vital for the CBAM Declarants to provision the necessary certificates in their CBAM accounts. The accounts and the certificates will be highly sensitive information.\nThe ETS system will simply set the selling price of the certificates.\nThe primary users of the CBAM Registry are the CBAM Declarants. DG TAXUD anticipates that they may amount to 200.000 in 2026 (following the adoption of the simplification the number of declarants will be reduced but it will be further extended by the CBAM extension for the downstream goods). They will use the CBAM Registry to declare the emission accrued on the production of their imported goods on a yearly basis (May of each year), to monitor the quarterly balance of their CBAM accounts in term of certificates versus declared imports and to interact with the National Customs Authorities during review of their CBAM declarations. The CBAM Declarants will first be vetted by the National Competent Authorities via the CBAM Registry and then be granted an authorisation to import CBAM goods and be given a CBAM account. The CBAM Declarants will then be able to declare annually their emissions in the CBAM Registry and to surrender the required certificates.\nThe Operators of the Installations producing the CBAM goods in the third countries will register on the CBAM Registry before entering the emission details of their products. The CBAM Declarants will be able to refer to the entries of the Operators to justify their reported emission. It is a significant measure to reduce the compliance burden of the CBAM Declarants and to improve the quality of the CBAM data. While there is no evidence to support an estimate at this stage, DG TAXUD guestimates the number of Operators at 50.000 in 2026.\nThe CBAM National Competent Authorities (NCA) will use the CBAM Registry to grant the access to the CBAM Declarants, to manage the CBAM Authorisations, to monitor the CBAM accounts and declarations and interact with the CBAM Declarants to ensure their compliance with the CBAM regulation. They are the single point of contact to the CBAM Declarants.\nOther Authorities will be granted access to the CBAM Registry to contribute to the risk management and the enforcement from their respective areas of responsibilities. The CBAM Registry will coordinate and support the inter-agencies collaboration in fostering compliance. The National Customs Administrations will validate the CBAM Authorisation during the control of the import declarations using the replication and validation services of the CBAM Registry via the EU CSW-CERTEX.\nThe Commission will assign and maintain the CBAM accounts of the CBAM Declarants up to date in the CBAM Registry, combining the information from the imports received from National Customs Administrations, the emissions from the yearly declarations, the quantity of certificates, their purchase reported by the CCP, their yearly surrendering confirmed by the CBAM Declarant, and the re-purchase of unused certificates. The\nEN\n47\nEN\nCommission will use the CBAM Registry to monitor the imported goods and associated emissions, for the risk management, and particularly the risk of circumvention. The CBAM Registry will also offer a secure forum for the exchange of sensitive information between all Authorities having a responsibility in the enforcement of the CBAM regulation.\nThe access of all actors to the CBAM Registry via dedicated portals supported by a distributed access management across the stakeholders:\ne The NCA will manage the access of the CBAM Declarants to the CBAM Declarant portal, using either national credentials already granted by the National Customs Administrations or an EU login one; The Commission will manage the access of the Operators of the third countries Installations, to the same name portal, using credentials granted by EU login. It remains to be clarified whether the Commission will rely on external trusted parties to delegate them the granting of the authorisation to access the CBAM Registry; The NCA, the Commission and other Authorities will each manage the access to their users.\nThe CBAM Core Registry depicts the automated processes that the Commission will operate to fulfil its obligations under the CBAM regulation, as summarised above. The Reference Data Management will be a key -office process ensuring the consistency and integrity of all automated processes serving the collaboration and cooperation between all stakeholders. Beyond the “simple” list of goods, of National Competent Authorities, and of the price of emission, they will list the specific parameters used to report emissions according to specific methodologies and the default value for the emissions as established. The default value is key for the plausibility validation of the declared emissions.\n4.2. Data\nCBAM will be processing following data assets\nCBAM Declarant Data.

Interoperability assessment\nCBAM is cross border by design as it supports the CBAM lifecycle across the EU, and in particular the orchestration of the Risk Assessment, review of the CBAM Declarations across all NCA and the Commission.\nCollaboration across National Customs systems will be ensured, by leveraging the Commission’s IT services and interfaces (such as SURV3, EU CSW - CERTEX), as well as new components, specifically designed for CBAM purposes.\nThe CBAM Registry has been designed to support interoperability by emphasizing use on openness, modularity, decoupling and robust interfaces. It will interact with the CBAM national systems, with the Common Central Platform, the EU Customs systems from DG TAXUD and the National Customs Administrations, with the other DG’s systems via open interfaces\nThe CBAM Central Repository will use the existing interfaces of the EU Customs Systems managed by DG TAXUD and will define dedicated formats for the Customs Import and Inward Processing records to be provided by the National Customs Administrations. The new interfaces with the National Customs Systems will be published early 2024 to allow the National Customs Administrations enough lead time to prepare their systems accordingly.\nThe S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CCP will be based on structured messages exchange and be available early 2024 to allow enough lead time for both the CBAM Registry and the CCP to integrate their respective interfaces by mid-2025.\nThe S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CBAM National Systems (to be developed by the MS) will be based on structured message exchanges and also be made available early 2024.\nThe S2S interface with the systems of the other EU Authorities will be specified and developed on a bilateral basis during the elaboration and build of the CBAM Registry.\nAll these interfaces will be structured messages based and will comply as far as possible with the EUCDM and with the UCC Annex B. The A2B and B2B specifications will be referred in a CBAM Implementing Act\nReusability Constraints\nThe reusability is at the very heart of the architecture principles adopted for the CBAM Central Register. There are two sides to the reusability: use of external services by the CBAM Registry and re-use components in the build of the CBAM Registry.\nReusability from DG TAXUD services and components\nEN\n52\nEN\nThe CBAM Registry will use the EU Customs Services offered by DG TAXUD out of the box to:\ne retrieve the EORI information of the trader;\ne get the customs import records available from Surveillance 3;\ne get the CBAM goods from the TARIC system;\ne offer the CBAM Authorisations Replication and Validation service to the National\nCustoms Systems via the EU CSW-CERTEX and;\ne exchange secure information with the CRMS2 system.\nThe user access management of the portals of the CBAM Registry will be entrusted to UUM&DS, allowing the willing MS to re-use the Customs credentials of the CBAM Declarants to provide them access to the CBAM Declarant portal and the Commission (or trusted third parties) to grant access right to the Operators of the third countries Installations to their EU Login authentication credentials.\nThe CBAM Registry will reuse several technology components of the DG TAXUD and Corporate IT landscape without compromising its compliance with the floatability principle spelt out in the Architecture Overview in appendix 2, namely:\ne The DG TAXUD TSOAP middleware architecture which will be reused in each of the CBAM Registry compartments; The monitoring and auditing COTS Elk and Kafka; The sources of the Customs application framework management (TATAFng) of DG TAXUD; The documentation and source code of the Customs Decision Management System of DG TAXUD for the built of the CBAM Authorisation system; The documentation and source code of the Customer Reference System of DG TAXUD to provision the CBAM Authorisations to the National Customs Systems for their control during the import clearance; The documentation and source code of the Customs Risk Management System 2 (CRMS2) of DG TAXUD to provision the Secure Forum for Exchange of Information; The DG TAXUD TEMPO methodology, including PM?; The 2 Data Centres of DG TAXUD for the testing, integration and for as long as the CBAM Registry operation is entrusted to DG TAXUD, along with their firewalling, Active-Active clustering, the load balancing and the 2 DC Active- Passive to ensure the scalability, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, some of the security needed by the CBAM Registry.\nTo be noted that DG TAXUD has followed all recommendations from DIGIT since 2014\nwhen designing Business Application Services, Data Services and Utility Services for its\ngeneration of SOA applications.\nReusability from EU corporate services and components\nThe CBAM Registry will use EU Login for the authentication of the CBAM declarants of the MS being UUM&DS type D, of the Operators of the third Countries Installations and all officials of the National Competent Authorities, of the Commission, of the National Customs Administration and other Commission services. The CBAM Registry will use the Customs eIDAS eID network for the authentication of the CBAM Declarants from the MS\nEN\n53\nEN\nUUM&DS type A, B & C.\nThe CBAM Registry will use UUM&DS for the authorisation of all its users.\nA migration from UUM&DS to EU Access will be considered when all functionalities of UUM&DS will be offered by EU Access, including the support of the Customs eIDAS eID network.\nThe CBAM Registry will make available the CBAM public information on Europa.\nIn addition, DG TAXUD is keen to maximize the re-use of Corporate services and components that would meet some of the CBAM requirements, de-risk its timely deployment and secure the quality of its operation while lowering its CAPEX and OPEX.\n4.5. Measures to support digital implementation\nThe CBAM regulation defines the deployment of the CBAM Registry in two periods declined in 3 consecutive phases:\ne Period perspective: a progressive deployment during a Transitional Period from the Q4 2023 until the Q4 2025, followed by a Definitive Period from Q1 2026. o During the Transitional Period, the CBAM importers report the emission of their imported goods quarterly but do not have to purchase and surrender certificates. It is the running in period of the CBAM scheme. During the Definitive Period, starting on 01 January 2026, the CBAM Declarants must be authorised, they declare their emissions once per year, they purchase certificates to keep their CBAM account at minimum 80% balance between their emissions and the purchased certificates, and they surrender their certificates with their yearly declarations. e Phase & Part perspective: o CBAM Phase 1: the “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods (so called Part 1), to be used during the whole Transitional Period as from Q4 2023 (out of scope of the Project Charter); CBAM Phase 2: the “CBAM reports” provided by the importers of CBAM goods (Part 1), the CBAM Declarant Authorisation and the registration of the Operators of third countries Installations (so called Part 2) as from 31 December 2024 in anticipation of the Definitive Period; CBAM Phase 3: The Part 2 augmented with the CBAM declarations and certificates along with the full CBAM account management (so called Part 3) as from the start of the Definitive Period but without Part 1 “CBAM Reports” as from the end of the Transitional Period 31 December 2025.

Refer to the next section for the definition of the external systems and entities.\nCBAM Part 2 Scope: on top of Part 1, The “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods, comes the Part 2 “CBAM Authorisation and Installations” (both in green in the following diagrams), which will enter in operation on 31 December 2024 as mandated by the CBAM regulation. Both Part 1 and Part 2 will then be further maintained and evolved during the remaining of the Transitional Period. The “CBAM Authorisation and Installation” will be integrated in the CBAM Definitive System while the “CBAM reports” will be phased out at the end of the Transitional Period. The Part 1 and Part 2 interface the CBAM Registry with the National Customs Import Systems, with the National Customs Inward Processing Systems and the supporting EU Customs systems of DG TAXUD to foster compliance at minimal burden for trade. CBAM Part 2 comes in anticipation of the Definitive System by delivering its first component.\nThe CBAM Phase 2 Timeline: It starts on the 31 December 2024 and ends on the 31 December 2025 with the start of the Definitive Period. The user community is extended to the Operators of the Installations in the third countries while the CBAM Declarants will need to obtain the required authorisations for the Definitive Period.\nEN\n55\nEN\nAuthorised\nDeclarants\nOperators of 3rd\nCountries\nInstallations\nCBAM Phase 2 from 31.12.2024\no\\\na 1,\neer\n[Access uuwDs2_|\nA\ncommaleaton\n[access Ugwosz |\nA\nNational\nCompetent\nAuthorities\nEN\n56\nEN\nCBAM Part 3 Scope: The “CBAM Declarations, Accounts and Risk Management” part (in purple in the following diagram), will enter in operations at the start of the Definitive Period scheduled for the 1 January 2026. It constitutes the core of the CBAM definitive system. CBAM Part 3 also includes the interfaces with the National Import Systems for the CBAM Authorisations via the EU CSW-CERTEX, the Common Central Platform for the purchasing of CBAM Certificates, ETS, OLAF, and the Systems of the National Competent Authorities. Furthermore, it adds the CBAM Certificates capabilities to the CBAM Registry as well as all the Risk Management ones. As the CBAM Certificates and Risk Management modules handle confidential information and monitor cases of circumvention and non-compliance, CBAM Part 3 manages sensitive information and requires highly secure processes. This part will be further maintained and evolved during the Definitive Period.\nThe CBAM Phase 3 Timeline: It starts on the 1 January 2026 and matches with the Definitive Period. During this phase, only the parts 2 & 3 of CBAM will operate in parallel and in close interaction, as the Part 1 was specific for the Transitional Period and is phased out.

The Commission already gained experience in setting up a registry for CBAM purposes when it implemented the CBAM Transitional Registry under the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 (?). (2) In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the Commission is to adopt implementing rules for the functioning of the CBAM registry. (3) The CBAM registry should be the system for the filing and management of the CBAM declarations, including checks, indicative assessments, and review procedures. The CBAM registry should contain data on authorised CBAM declarants, applicants filing a request to be granted the status of authorised CBAM declarant (‘applicants’), operators, and accredited CBAM verifiers. The information about the operators shall be contained in a separate section of the CBAM registry. The CBAM registry should also include the IT infrastructure required to allow for the analytical tasks inherent in CBAM risk-analysis functions that the Commission is to perform. (4) To ensure an accurate assessment of the reporting obligations, to provide customs authorities with access to CBAM data for the purposes of the verification of CBAM formalities during customs clearance, and to support the risk analysis and circumvention monitoring, including investigation in accordance with Articles 15, 19 and 27 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the CBAM registry should be interoperable with existing customs systems and should in particular exchange the data gathered by means of surveillance in accordance with Article 56(5) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (’). The CBAM registry should therefore use standardised data exchanges with existing customs systems. (5) In order to ensure an effective and uniform reporting system, technical arrangements for the functioning of the CBAM registry should be laid down. Such arrangements include arrangements for the development of the CBAM registry, interfaces, data protection, updating of data, limitation of data processing, system ownership and security, as well as testing and deployment, maintenance and potential modifications.

Introduction\nThe European Union has set itself the legal objective of becoming a climate-neutral and climate resilient continent by 2050 as enshrined in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 on the European Climate Law!. These binding goals were specified in the Communications on the European Green Deal? and on A Strong Social Europe for Just Transitions®, in which the Commission set the ambition to upgrade Europe’s social market economy to achieve a just transition to sustainability.\nIn his report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness’, Mario Draghi emphasised the need for Europe to create a regulatory landscape which facilitates competitiveness and resilience.’ In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs’.° Multiple companies and stakeholders have voiced their concerns about the administrative burden resulting from a number of EU acts, including Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM Regulation’)°.\nIn its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would deliver an unprecedented simplification effort to achieve the agreed policy objectives in the simplest, most targeted, most effective and least burdensome way. In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground, requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules.’\nAs part of the European Green Deal, the European Union introduced the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)’. CBAM is an environmental instrument that tackles carbon leakage by putting a carbon price on imports of CBAM goods. The CBAM applies to imports of certain goods and selected precursors: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen. CBAM will apply with financial consequences as from 2026, while the current transitional phase spans between 2023 and 2025. The experience gained during the first year and a half of CBAM implementation during the transitional phase shows that there is scope to simplify the CBAM while preserving its environmental integrity. The need for simplification was actively raised by all stakeholders both in the EU and outside, public authorities and business. A broad set of mutually reinforcing amendments are proposed\n' Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’) (OJ L 243, 9.7.2021, p. 1).\n2 COM/2019/640 final\n3 COM/2020/14 final\n4“The future of European competitiveness”, September 2024.\n> Budapest Declaration the New European Competitiveness Deal, 8 November 2024. on\n6 Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing carbon border a adjustment mechanism (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 52, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/o}). 7 https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/8556fc33-48a3-4a96-94¢e8-\n8ecacefleal8_en?filename=250201 Simplification Communication_en.pdf\n8 Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing carbon border a adjustment mechanism (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 52, http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/o]) (‘the CBAM Regulation).\nto facilitate the smooth implementation of CBAM and minimise its administrative burden while ensuring its environmental integrity.\nSimplifying CBAM is part of an unprecedented simplification effort by the European Commission, in the Competitiveness Compass 9 To sustained and as set out . ensure measurable efforts over the years ahead, the Commission has set ambitious quantified targets for reducing administrative burden: at least 25% for all companies and at least 35% for SMEs. One central element of the CBAM simplification package is to introduce a new CBAM de minimis threshold, which will allow to exempt occasional importers of small quantities of CBAM goods. For exempted importers, administrative costs related to the CBAM — that means all costs related to the compliance with CBAM other than the financial CBAM obligation - will be cut by almost 100%. As the majority of the exempted importers are SMEs, the CBAM simplification will contribute substantially to the Commission targets.\nThis simplification package in itself is of key importance for ensuring the functioning of the CBAM. It is a crucial first step towards a strengthened and more effective CBAM that delivers on climate objectives without putting undue burden on businesses. Simplifying the CBAM will be key to making the mechanism work on the ground and support EU industry in its decarbonisation efforts by avoiding carbon leakage risks. Simplifying the mechanism would also be a key enabler for a potential future scope extension, notably to downstream goods.\nThe present document discusses the proposed simplifications of the CBAM Regulation for the Omnibus legislative package. The document is organised in two main sections. Section 2 focuses on the measures to simplify CBAM for small importers, outlining and assessing the proposal for a new de minimis threshold. Section 3 covers other simplifications that will benefit larger importers of CBAM goods and also operators in third countries.\n2. Simplifying CBAM for small CBAM importers: A new de minimis threshold\n2.1 Problem definition\nFrom the experience gathered during the ongoing transitional period, it has become clear that compliance with CBAM entails an administrative burden for EU importers, who need to obtain an authorisation to become CBAM declarants prior to the importation of CBAM goods, submit an annual declaration (based on actual emissions’ information received from their suppliers or on the use of default values with a markup), purchase and surrender CBAM certificates. To date, the experience from the reporting during the CBAM transitional period and from exchanges with Member States, industry stakeholders, international partners, third country operators, and NGOs have confirmed that the compliance burden is particularly onerous for occasional importers of small quantities of CBAM goods.\nThe problem essentially concerns four CBAM industrial sectors, namely iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement.'°® For these, customs import data from the first year of the\n? COM/2025/30\n'0 Tn contrast, the problem of having large number of occasional importers is not applicable to the other two CBAM sectors, a electricity and hydrogen. In the case of electricity, the sector is instead characterised by imports of large volumes by a limited number of individual importers. The hydrogen sector is characterised by a very low number of importers overall. The customs data analysed show that there are only 64 importers of hydrogen across the EU-27, which together account for 92%\ntransitional period of the CBAM (Q4 2023 — Q3 2024) show that roughly 80% of CBAM importers accounted for only 0.1% of all imported emissions embedded in CBAM goods, and only 10% of importers accounted for more than 99% of the emissions (see Figure 1 below). Several Member States submitted similar findings based on the analysis of their national customs data. Moreover, the median value of CBAM goods imported per (small) importer per year (that is, importing for example less than 50 tonnes of mass per year) is only around EUR 1,600 (see Section 2.3.1 for more detail). Therefore, the administrative costs for small importers, which were estimated, in the 2021 impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal'!, to range from EUR 5,440 to EUR 6,900 per year!’, are disproportionate compared to the value of goods imported into the EU by these small importers.\nFigure 1.

Article 2(3)(a) of the CBAM regulation exempts goods listed in\nof the overall emissions of the hydrogen sector. For these reasons, hydrogen and electricity are excluded from this proposal to exempt occasional importers of small CBAM quantities.\n'l See Impact Assessment Report of 14.7.2021 (SWD(2021) 643 final). Throughout the current Staff Working Document, the numbers taken from the 2021 Impact Assessment Report have not been adjusted for inflation.\n'2 Tf default values used for CBAM declarations (see Section 2.3.1). are\n'3 Based customs import data from the first (Q4 2023 Q3 2024), CBAM goods imported in the EU by on year — were approximately 200.000 importers. Of these, close to 58% were pure iron and steel importers, about 20% were pure aluminium importers and another 20% importers of both iron and steel and aluminium goods. The remaining 2% consisted of fertilisers importers (1%), cement importers (0.4%), and importers of other different combinations of CBAM goods (0.6%). It is estimated that the total yearly number of importers is approximately 200,000. The missing number of importers is extrapolated with the 175,000 analysed so far, representing 89% of overall emissions for the four CBAM sectors included in the simplification.\nAnnex I to the CBAM Regulation from its scope provided that the intrinsic value of such goods does not exceed, per consignment, the value specified for goods of negligible value as referred to in Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009\" - currently EUR 150. Based on the data collected during the ongoing transitional period, it can be concluded that this threshold has proven insufficient to exclude occasional importers of small CBAM quantities, responsible only for a very small fraction of GHG emissions and which are often small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), or individuals, from the scope of CBAM. Moreover, on 17 May 2023, the Commission put forward proposals for the reform of the EU Customs Union. If adopted, the proposed reform will abolish the current threshold whereby goods valued at less than EUR 150 are exempt from customs duty, because it is prone to a high risk of circumvention of the customs rules and distorts the level playing field for EU businesses. 15\nThere are a number of problematic issues in the design of the current CBAM de minimis threshold:\n1) The current threshold is too low. While the Commission impact assessment estimated around 20,000 CBAM importers per year, the analysis of customs data shows that there are 10 times more importers in scope of the CBAM!° many of which SMEs (see box 2 in section 2.3.1 for more detail). As described above, this leads to a higher administrative burden than anticipated, which is particularly onerous for occasional importers of small quantities of CBAM goods. 2) The current threshold is expressed in monetary value. This is not a good indication for policy relevance, since the CBAM is based on embedded emissions. Analysis, using the Commission’s global default values at product level and Surveillance data, shows that mass is a better proxy for embedded emissions of importers than value for the current product scope, in line with the environmental objective of the CBAM. This will likely be even more the case, if and when the CBAM scope will be extended to downstream products, where the CBAM goods are representing only parts of the imported products. While the decisions on the future scope are not yet taken, it is important to design a system that is future-proof to provide legal and planning certainty. 3) The current threshold is applied on a consignment-basis. This poses problems in terms of circumvention risks, which led the European Union to abolish the EUR 22 VAT threshold!’ and the European Commission to propose abolishing the EUR 150 threshold for customs duties. Moreover, such an approach is insufficiently tailored to occasional importers of small CBAM quantities: Some large importers would also benefit from such an exemption, because some of their consignments would be below the consignment-threshold despite having over the year material CBAM imports. Conversely, a significant number of occasional importers of small quantities — as measured by estimated annual emissions in their imports - would not be exempted,\n'4 This threshold is based Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 of 16 November 2009 setting Community system on up a of reliefs from customs duty.\n'5 The estimated savings from the proposed do not overlap with estimated savings from the UCC reform. While measures there are strong synergies between the Customs reform proposal, notably the strengthened EU customs risk management and the establishment of a central EU Customs Data Hub, which will facilitate enforcement of the CBAM, all savings estimated in this document are CBAM-specific.\n'6 This assessment is based Surveillance data. on\n'7 Council Directive (EU) 2017/2455\nbecause they would have one or a few consignments above such a threshold (See section 2.2.1 for more details). From a policy perspective, what matters for CBAM, and its environmental objective, are annual emissions embedded in CBAM goods imported into the Union.\nIn addition to the administrative costs for occasional importers, the high number of CBAM importers currently in scope by consequence implies a high burden on authorities, notably national competent authorities (NCAs). An effective CBAM relies on effective monitoring and enforcement. Under the current rules, NCAs would need to check and ensure compliance for a large population of importers. The overwhelming majority of them import goods with a very limited number of embedded emissions. This would absorb resources that could otherwise be devoted to monitor and ensure compliance of imports with material levels of emissions.\n2.2 Proposed way forward\nBased on the data collected throughout the ongoing transitional period, the Commission proposes an informed amendment to the current de minimis threshold to reduce administrative costs for all actors involved, notably SMEs, while preserving the environmental integrity of the CBAM. This is achieved by amending the threshold and setting a target of at least 99% of emissions to remain in the scope. By exempting less than 1% of emissions the amendment would preserve the environmental objective of the CBAM.\nGiven the above, this proposal consists in an exemption based on an annual cumulative mass threshold of imports in the four industrial CBAM sectors per importer. A mass- based threshold of 50 tonnes is proposed to ensure that more than 99% of emissions are maintained in the scope. The mass-based threshold is calculated to translate the emissions objective of maintaining more than 99% emissions in scope based on a methodology using customs import data and the Commission’s global default values (see Box | for more detail). The threshold would be updated for the subsequent year, if the methodology to derive the mass-based threshold ensuring that at least 99% emissions are in scope results in a threshold that deviates by more than 5 tonnes from the threshold chosen pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Annex of the CBAM regulation.\nImporters that are below this threshold will be exempted from the CBAM authorisation and declaration obligation and from the obligation to purchase CBAM certificates. They will need to self-identify as “occasional CBAM importers” when lodging their customs declarations and monitor that they do not exceed the threshold over the year. Compliance with the threshold will be monitored by Commission and national authorities, based on Customs import data. This will be paired with strong anti-abuse provisions and will be subject to regular reviews to assess the robustness of the threshold in 2027 and every two years thereafter. The proposed exemption will allow the Commission and national authorities to focus their monitoring and enforcement on importers representing a material share of imports of CBAM goods, therefore strengthening the effectiveness of the CBAM, increasing the protection for EU industries against carbon leakage, and supporting decarbonisation efforts. By making the CBAM more administratively manageable, this simplification will also enable a potential future scope extension of the CBAM to a broader range of sectors, notably for downstream products, which is also an important step to address certain circumvention practices. The proposed way forward would also alleviate CBAM related reporting burden on third country producers.\n2.2.1. An easily implementable and environmentally robust threshold\nA simplification that maintains the environmental integrity of CBAM. Different levels of mass were assessed for the determination of the threshold, ranging from 10 to 500 tonnes (see Table 1).\nThe choice of a threshold of 50 tonnes per year per importer is guided by two dimensions:\n1) Preserve the environmental integrity of the CBAM 2) Conditional to one, maximise the benefit in terms of reduced administrative burden\nCBAM is an environmental measure. The proposed simplifications should not reduce the effectiveness of the CBAM as a climate instrument. With this in mind, it is proposed to set out in the Regulation a target of emissions that need to be maintained in scope. Taking also into account cost-benefit considerations, a target of maintaining at least 99% of emissions was chosen. Such a target would both maximise the benefits from simplification and ensure that only a negligible volume of emissions is exempted compared to the total. It also allows for making the exemption future-proof (see section 2.2.1).\nBased on a robust methodology (see Box 1), this emissions-target is translated into a cumulative mass-based threshold of 50 tonnes per importer per year. Considering the weighted average emission intensity across all four sectors (iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement), the 50 tonnes mass-based threshold corresponds to approximately 80 tonnes of CO2 equivalent on average per importer.'’ Such a mass-based threshold would allow for exempting an estimated 182,000 importers (91% of total number of importers), representing less than 1% (i.e. 0.73%) of the total emissions of the imports across the four CBAM sectors considered (iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers).\nTable 1.

The weighted average emission intensity of 1.55 tCO2/t across all four sectors (iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement) is calculated by dividing the total emissions (that is the sum of emissions across all importers) by the total volume in tonnes imported by these importers.\n!°\nThe table covers the four CBAM sectors included in the proposed simplification: aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel. Its interpretation should be as follows: 83% of all CBAM importers have imported less than 10 tonnes of these four CBAM goods from October 2023 to September 2024 and account for 0.02% of all emissions. It is estimated that the total yearly number of importers is approximately 200,000. The column on “estimated remaining number of importers” extrapolates the missing number of importers with the 175,000 analysed so far, representing 89% of overall emissions for the four CBAM sectors included in the simplification.\nBox 1. Methodology to determine the mass threshold\nThe mass-threshold is set to ensure that at least 99% of embedded emissions are covered by CBAM, which, in turn, preserves the environmental objectives of the mechanism.\nIn order to do so, the emissions embedded in the quantities imported need to be estimated. For the implementation of this calculation, customs data from 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024 were used. These correspond to the first 12 months of CBAM transitional regime and provided to the Commission through the surveillance system. 20,21 are\nFor each customs declaration, the amount of corresponding CO2 emissions is calculated by multiplying the volume imported for each CN code with the corresponding Commission’s global default value (without mark-ups) for emissions published for the transitional period. As per the CBAM Regulation, for cement and fertilisers direct emissions and indirect emissions are considered, while for aluminium and iron and steel only direct emissions are considered. The volumes imported and corresponding CO2 emissions (see Equation 1 below) are then aggregated at importer-level:\nEquation 1:\nJi\njJ=1 >,\nFor a given importer i, Em; = qi jE]\nwhere:\nqi, is the imported volume in tonnes by importer i of the CN code j, J, 1s the number of CN codes imported by importer i among the four sectors considered (aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel), El; is the emission intensity for CN code j.”\nFor a given annual threshold in tonnes of volume imported, importers that would not be exempted are identified and the corresponding proportion of overall emissions captured is calculated (see Equation 2 below for a given mass-threshold of Q tonnes):\nEquation 2:\nproportion of emissions captured for amass — threshold of Q tonnes =\nthy Em; x 1(Q; > Q)\nTotal emissions\nwhere:\n- Q is the mass-threshold in tonnes allowing to capture a given target share of emissions (see paragraph below);\n20 The Commission surveillance system (\"customs surveillance\") records and centralises all trade data (import and exports) directly from the national customs authorities on a daily basis. For each transaction, the stored data contain the information available on the Single Administrative Document (SAD), including the volume and origin of the consignment. According to Art.55(2) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, the customs authorities shall provide the Commission at least once a week with data on customs declarations for the goods that have been made subject to surveillance at release for free circulation or at export.\n21 Tt should be noted that for Member States, customs data provided in the surveillance system do not contain the some Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) identifiers for the importers for the full period considered. For these Member States, customs data from the surveillance system are therefore supplemented by customs data provided separately to the Commission. Overall, the customs data used in the simplification analysis include approximately 175,000 importers, representing 89% of the emissions for the four CBAM sectors (aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel).\n22 For the\npurpose\nof defining the 50\ntonnes\nmass-threshold, the emission intensities E; based default value (without\nare\non\nmark-ups) for emissions published for the transitional period. As per the CBAM Regulation, for CN codes in cement and fertilisers, direct emissions and indirect emissions are considered; for CN codes in aluminium and iron and steel, only direct emissions are considered.\n- Qi Dy qi,j : the total volume in tonnes of CBAM goods imported by importer i,\n—\n1(Q; > Q) is an indicator function equal to 1 when Q; > Q (that is, when an importer is importing volumes higher than the mass-threshold Q), 0 otherwise, Total emissions : the total emissions in CO2 of the four CBAM sectors considered, that is the sum of corresponding emissions for all importers: total emissions = Y:_, Em; , where N is the number of importers.\n=\nThe proposed mass-threshold is set based on the following methodology:\na) At least 99% of emissions should be captured, in order to preserve the environmental integrity of the CBAM (see Equation 3);\nEquation 3:\nYL, Em; x 1_(Q; > Q)\nQ chosen such that\n> target share of emissions of 99%\nTotal emissions\nb) To capture uncertainty over future trade patterns while maintaining the environmental objective, a margin of 0.25 percentage points is added to the 99% emissions target. c) For simplicity, the mass-threshold is rounded to the nearest ten, e.g. if a value of 52 tonnes would result in 99.25% emissions captured it would be rounded down to 50 tonnes, if a value of 57 tonnes would result in 99.25% emission captured, it would be rounded up to 60 tonnes.\nBased on a-c, the threshold is set at 50 tonnes mass per importer per year.\nTo make this approach future-proof, a mechanism is introduced to ensure that the emissions target share is met, even if trade patterns evolve or default values are updated. By July of each calendar year, the Commission shall, based on data covering a reference period of 12 months preceding the month of this assessment, assess whether the value derived from the aforementioned methodology deviates by more than 5 tonnes from the threshold laid down in point 1 of Annex VII. Where this is the case, and in accordance with the empowerment laid out in Article 2(3a) of this Regulation, the Commission shall update the threshold.\nFigure 2 below also illustrates the environmental integrity of the CBAM (proxied by the red curve illustrating the percentage of emission from non-exempted importers) against the proportion of importers exempted (blue curve).\nFigure 2.

Note: Line A corresponds to a threshold of 10 tonnes, line B to 30 tonnes, line C to 50 tonnes, line D to 70 tonnes, line E to 150 tonnes, line F to 250 tonnes, line G to 500 tonnes.\nA targeted and robust threshold, maximising benefits and limiting circumvention risks.\nThe proposed approach changes the logic from a current consignment-based threshold to an annual cumulative threshold at importer level. This would allow for a more targeted and robust exemption than a consignment threshold. Differences in CBAM compliance burden are most pronounced at the margin between being part of the CBAM scope or not. This is because many compliance steps are either done once or on an annual or quarterly basis. For example, obtaining the status of authorisation CBAM declarant is done once. Complying with the rule to have a sufficient number of CBAM certificates on the account (See also Section 3.4.1) is a quarterly obligation. Complying with the CBAM declaration and financial obligations is an annual exercise. This means that the measure of efficiency for the threshold is not to maximise the number of exempted consignments given a certain in-scope emission level, but to maximise the number of exempted importers. Put differently, the reduction in administrative costs of having a consignment out of scope for importers that are otherwise in scope of the CBAM is negligible, as most of the administrative costs arise anyway.\nIn this respect, the annual cumulative threshold is clearly superior: For example, with the same emission target (e.g. 99.27% emissions in scope with an annual threshold of 50 tonnes) approximately 79% of importers would have been exempted under a consignment approach,” which is 12 percentage points less than under the annual threshold approach (1.e. an estimated 24,000 fewer companies that would benefit from the exemption). Moreover, amongst the importers that import less than 50 tonnes per year, approximately 13% of these importers have consignments above the consignment-threshold and would therefore not be exempted under a consignment approach. Last, amongst the importers that import more than 50 tonnes per year,\n3 The analysis shows that consignment threshold around 2.6 tonnes would allow to capture approximately 99.27% of the a overall emissions. An importer is exempted if all its consignments are below the consignment-threshold.\na a a ea ea rs\nSERS SRST EERSTE SSSR STEER\nalmost all of them have consignments below the consignment-threshold, and 25% of consignments are in average below the consignment-threshold.\nIn addition, a consignment-based threshold is prone to higher circumvention risks (such as from artificial splitting of consignments). This is not the case with an annual cumulative threshold.\nA simple implementation with the use of a mass-based threshold for importers. In their analysis, Commission services considered as an alternative a threshold expressed in CO2 emissions instead of the mass-based threshold. However, this alternative was discarded with a view to simplifying application for importers. Various stakeholders (Industry representatives and NGOs) expressed a strong preference for a mass-based approach, among others at a stakeholder event on 6 February. Importers, and particularly occasional importers of small quantities, are unlikely to be aware of the levels of emissions embedded in their goods — which is precisely part of the administrative burden that this proposal aims to cut. If the threshold was expressed in emissions, importers would have to self-monitor their import volumes for each of the CN codes that they import and multiply these with the default values on emission intensities of those CN codes. In contrast, the proposed mass-based threshold both ensures that the overall emission target is achieved (that is, more than 99% of emissions are captured by the remaining importers) and facilitates implementation, as importers can self- monitor their compliance with the threshold entirely based on data provided for the customs declaration, thereby reducing the administrative costs to the lowest levels possible.\nThis choice entails some trade-offs. CBAM products are characterised by divergent emission intensities, which cannot be captured individually by a mass-based threshold. This creates the theoretical possibility that importers, which would have been exempted under a hypothetical emissions-based threshold equivalent to the 50 tonnes mass-threshold, which is approximately 80 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, would now not be exempted. This said, analysis suggests that such cases only materialise rarely in reality: based on the same methodology used to derive the threshold, less than 0.05% of all importers would not be exempted based on the cumulative mass-based threshold of 50 tonnes, while their emissions embedded in their imports would be below the hypothetical emissions-equivalent threshold of approximately 80 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This means that the loss of accuracy resulting from a simpler design of the threshold affects less than 100 importers, while it benefits the more than 180,000 other importers that will have fewer administrative costs related to the monitoring of their compliance with the threshold.\nAnother alternative, somewhat in between an emissions-based threshold and a single mass- based threshold, would have been to express the mass-based threshold per sector (i.e., four mass-based thresholds), aiming to capture divergences in emission intensities between sectors. However, this option was discarded as it would have introduced the possibility that importers who import goods from more than one sector remain under the respective sectoral mass-thresholds while importing up to four times more tonnes compared to importers who are only active in one CBAM sector.\nA future proof threshold. This approach set out in 2.2.1 and as detailed in Box 1 is future proof. It is anchored around a clear and unambiguous emission-target share of at least 99% of emissions, fully reflecting the environmental objective of the CBAM. This target will remain valid over time, and would also be appropriate, if and when there was a decision to extend the sector to other EU ETS sectors at risk of carbon leakage or to downstream products. Moreover, the methodology translating the 99%-target into practical application is designed to dynamically align to changes in trade patterns and/or the level of emission\n10\nintensities, ensuring that also going forward, the environmental objective of the CBAM is fully preserved.\n2.2.2 What does the simplification mean for importers?\nA simplified operationalisation for importers. Importers that expect to stay below the annual cumulative threshold, and thus qualify for the exemption, can, when lodging an import declaration for a CBAM good, self-identify as an occasional CBAM importer and thereby be granted a derogation from the authorisation obligation. These importers would not be required to take any additional administrative steps and would not have to access the CBAM Registry. At any time during the year, a self-identified occasional importer can decide to apply for the status of an authorised CBAM declarant in case it expects to exceed the de minimis threshold.\nThroughout the year, importers would self-monitor the volume of their imports to estimate and examine whether the mass-based threshold is reached. Defining the threshold in “mass” facilitates the monitoring as importers would be able to check their compliance with the threshold not based on emission intensities but on mass of imports only, which is data they already provided in the customs declaration and thus already available. The obligation is thus limited to the summation of the quantities of imported CBAM goods.\nCertainty for exempted importers. Importers should have certainty about their status — whether they are exempted or not. This is not a concern for large importers whose imports clearly exceed the threshold - these know that they are not exempted. It is also not a concern for importers that are importing at very low levels. Therefore, only importers with import activities around the selected threshold will face some administrative burden in terms of projecting whether they expect their imports over the calendar year to remain below the threshold. Estimates suggest that around 2700 importers are importing at levels +/-15% of 50 tonnes of mass. These are only around 1.3% of the total number of importers, meaning that a 50 tonnes mass-threshold would provide reasonably levels of planning certainty for more than 98.5% of all importers of CBAM goods.\nCalculation of the CBAM financial adjustment for importers above the thresholds. The new CBAM de minimis will not affect the calculation of the CBAM financial adjustment for importers above the threshold. Importers who expect to exceed the threshold during the calendar year must apply for authorisation. If they indeed exceed the threshold, the CBAM financial adjustment will be calculated against all imports of CBAM goods.\nAn alternative design, which would provide for a deduction for importers above the threshold of emissions equivalent to the mass threshold was discarded for the following reasons:\ne Allowing for the deduction of the embedded emissions below the 50 tonnes mass threshold also for large CBAM importers would almost triple the number of exempted emissions — from 0.73% of total emissions to 1.98% of total emissions. This is due to the fact that all large importers would get a rebate of the full emissions equivalent of the 50 tonnes mass threshold (after accounting for any reporting based on actual values and the deduction of the CBAM factor), whereas the vast majority of exempted importers imports quantities substantially below the threshold, thus benefiting less in absolute terms from the exemption to acquire CBAM certificates. Such a deduction would not provide any added value in terms of reduction in administrative costs, as they only apply to importers that are in scope of CBAM and therefore have to comply with all reporting and financial obligations anyway.\n11\n2.2.3 Compliance and Circumvention risks\nThe proposed simplification will allow authorities to focus their efforts on ensuring compliance by large importers, instead of ensuring compliance of a large number of small players.\nMonitoring, detecting circumvention and enforcement. Monitoring will be conducted on the basis of customs data obtained in the Surveillance system, allowing the Commission to have an EU-wide approach for all imports into the Union. The CBAM Regulation will be amended to specify that the Commission and NCAs for CBAM are jointly responsible for the monitoring of occasional importers and for detecting those who exceed the threshold.”* Where the Commission detects that an importer has exceeded the threshold, it shall inform the NCA and the NCA will establish whether the threshold has been exceeded.\nNational customs authorities who receive information from the NCA that an importer has exceeded the threshold must not allow the importation of further CBAM goods by this importer, in accordance with Article 25(1) of the CBAM Regulation. In addition, occasional importers who have exceeded the threshold without previously having obtained an authorisation will be liable for the payment of a penalty. If the importer wants to resume the import of CBAM goods once the threshold was exceeded, then it will have to obtain the status of ‘authorised CBAM declarant’, submit a CBAM declaration and surrender certificates corresponding to these additional imports.\nLimited risks of circumvention under a robust monitoring system. While an annual threshold is not prone to circumvention risks that are known from the application of consignment-based de minimis thresholds such as artificial splitting of consignments, one circumvention risk that may arise is that importers may artificially split their imports across different subsidiaries or related entities, each with a different EORI number (“artificial split of EORI numbers”). Such a scheme would enable each subsidiary to remain below the threshold while at group level, they would import in total a quantity exceeding the threshold. However, such a scheme may be costly and cumbersome to set up and it is not evident that the benefits would outweigh the costs: the proposed annual threshold of 50 tonnes would only represent around EUR 4000 CBAM financial obligation on average per importer per year.*> Moreover, Commission services and other authorities will be able to track changes in import patterns and, analysing customs data combined with other data sources, will be able to detect material circumvention schemes.\nStrengthening of anti-abuse provisions. The CBAM Regulation will also include strengthened anti-abuse provisions, with an explicit reference to cases of “artificial split of EORI numbers’, and will provide for extended empowerments for authorities to act upon non-compliance and circumvention activities. In particular, NCAs will be able to apply penalties where companies have artificially split their imports over separate importers with different EORI numbers for the main purpose of avoiding CBAM obligations. Lastly, thanks to the simplification, CBAM authorities will also be able to focus resources on major circumvention risks.\n24 While these efforts will be of high importance to the effectiveness of CBAM, they will entail much lower ensure administrative burden for authorities than what would be required without a new de minimis provision.\n5 This is based the following calculations: (i) 50 tonnes multiplied by (weighted) emission factor the four on average across CBAM sectors of 1.55 implied 77.5 tonnes CO2 eq., (ii) an effective carbon price (1.e., taking into account gradual phase in of CBAM) at EUR 50.\n12\nContinuous monitoring of the robustness of the threshold. Finally, it is proposed that the Commission will monitor the robustness of the threshold in terms of circumvention risks, including through the biennial report reviewing the functioning of the CBAM as set out in Article 30 (6) of the CBAM Regulation.\n2.3 Impact and quantification of the savings\nAs mentioned above, introducing a de minimis threshold of 50 tonnes will free tens of thousands of small importers from any administrative burden related to CBAM, as well as alleviate the burden on public authorities. At the same time, there will be some loss of revenues. This section discusses the cost-benefit analysis.\nAs regards the cost savings from a new de minimis, two categories are considered.\nThe first category corresponds to cost savings for exempted importers since no administrative costs will apply to them. As explained below, this amounts to approximately EUR 1,123 million per year. The analysis of the profile of exempted importers also shows that mostly SMEs benefit from these cost-savings, as they make up at least 74% of the companies affected by the exemption. Cost savings for SMEs would therefore amount to at least EUR 831 million.”°\nThe second category corresponds to cost savings for public authorities in Member States, due to lower implementation and enforcement costs with the exemption applying to 91% of importers of CBAM goods. This amounts to approximately EUR 87.5 million.\nThe aggregated costs savings (i.e., across importers and public authorities) are then compared to the loss of revenue from the new de minimis, estimated at 1% of expected CBAM revenues.\nAs explained below, the cost-benefit analysis shows that the new de minimis of 50 tonnes of mass would lead to an overall net benefit of EUR 1,189 million. Nevertheless, it should be recalled that the collection of revenues is not the primary objective of CBAM.\nThis section focuses on impacts that are quantifiable with the available data. As set out in section 2.1 and 2.2, there will be also other entities that indirectly benefit from this exemption. For example, narrowing down the number of importers in the EU to those importing large quantities, inevitably narrows the scope of the supply chain affected upstream. The new CBAM de minimis will thus also benefit third-country operators in the form of reduced administrative costs.\n2.3.1 Estimated cost savings for small importers\nA 50 tonnes mass threshold would lead to the exemption of 91% of importers for the CBAM sectors considered in the simplification, namely aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel. This represents an estimated 182,000 exempted importers, who are the main target of the simplification.’\n26 See Better Regulation toolbox (https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law/better- regulation/better-regulation-guidelines-and-toolbox/better-regulation-toolbox_en), Chapter 22.\n27 Without the proposed de minimis threshold of 50 tonnes of of the importers of CBAM goods could change new mass, some their behaviour and no longer import. For the purposes of this analysis, such behavioural change is not considered. This is\n13\nThe 2021 impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal estimated that administrative costs for importers would be in the range of EUR 5,440 to EUR 6,900 per year, under the situation where CBAM declarants use default values for emissions. Under the situation where CBAM declarants would report actual emission values, the yearly administrative costs would be in the range of EUR 30,800 to EUR 45,300 per year.”8\nSince exempted importers under this proposal would largely be small importers, the analysis assumes that they would choose to report emissions based on default values. Since an estimated 182,000 importers would be exempted under the proposed new de minimis threshold, the administrative cost savings for importers would be in the range of EUR 990,080,000 to EUR 1,255,800,000 per year. Moreover, these estimated cost savings do not consider that relying on default values would imply accepting increased levels of embedded emissions due to the proportionally increased mark-ups added to the average emissions intensities of a given country, resulting in higher administrative costs.\nIt should be noted that such administrative costs, i.e. in the range of EUR 5,440 to EUR 6,900 per year per importer, seem already disproportionately high compared to the value of goods imported into the EU by exempted importers (i.e., with yearly imports less than 50 tonnes of mass), where the median value per importer is around EUR 1,600 per year.?? This would be even more the case if small importers were reporting actual emission values, with administrative costs estimated in the range of EUR 30,800 to EUR 45,300 per year. Under the proposed new de minimis threshold of 50 tonnes of mass, these small importers could continue to import without being impacted by the CBAM.\nTo sum up, the administrative cost savings for all the exempted importers are estimated at approximately EUR 1.12 billion per year, which is the average of the range of EUR 990,080,000 to EUR 1,255,800,000 per year.\nCosts savings for SMEs. The profile of importers exempted under the proposed new de minimis threshold was also analysed, on the basis of data from the ORBIS database and customs.\nIn customs data, the importers are identified with their EORI numbers, except for natural persons and some occasional importers who are not required to have an EORI number. In contrast, companies are identified in ORBIS based on other identifiers. The Commission services carried out an exercise to reconcile the EORI numbers in customs data with the different identifiers available in ORBIS.\nBox 2 below details the analysis that shows that at least 74% of the exempted companies under the proposed simplification would be SMEs. In other words, among the EUR 1.12 billion per year of costs savings due to lower administrative costs, at least EUR 831 million would benefit SMEs. SMEs are therefore the main beneficiaries of the new de minimis threshold.\njustified, because even if some importers were no longer importing CBAM goods in such a scenario, this would lead to non- negligible costs for them (e.g. higher prices, changes in supply chains etc.) which are difficult to monetise. 28\nSee Impact Assessment Report of 14.7.2021 (SWD(2021) 643 final), Part 2/2, Table 6.3.\n2° This figure is based customs data for the period October 2023 to September 2024, for imports of CBAM goods. on\n14\nBox 2. Methodology to identify SMEs\nThe Commission services extracted from ORBIS several variables to define the type of companies: (i) number of employees, (ii) turnover, (iii) the size classification, which is a measure for the type of companies developed by ORBIS. In case of missing data in ORBIS for number of employees and turnover, the Commission services relied on the size classification variable provided by ORBIS that is a composite indicator of other variables.\nOverall, among the 175,000 importers available in customs data for EU imports of aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel, approximately 71,000 of the importers matched in ORBIS have information on the type of companies (1.e., size classification variable in ORBIS). Table 2 below provides the definition of small, medium, large, and very large, according to the size classification from ORBIS.\nTable 2.

The Commission services consider that this sample of 71,000 importers is still representative of the whole population of importers, since these 71,000 importers represent approximately 72% of the overall emissions for the four CBAM sectors included in the simplification.\nThe following elements should also be considered for the interpretation of the results.\n- First, the matching of customs data with ORBIS is biased toward large companies. This is because ORBIS is unlikely to include information on natural persons or occasional importers, which also import CBAM goods. Second, some identifiers are missing in customs data since (i) natural persons and occasional importers are not required to have an EORI identifier. Third, the definition of small and medium companies is more restrictive in ORBIS compared to the commonly accepted definition (https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme- fundamentals/sme-definition en): (1) some companies defined as medium in ORBIS are actually small companies (that is, with staff headcounts lower than 50), and (ii) some companies defined as large in\nORBIS are actually medium companies (with staff headcount lower than 250).\nBased on the considerations above, the analysis therefore underestimates the proportion of SMEs positively\naffected by the new de minis threshold.\nThe analysis shows that among these 71,000 importers:\n- Approximately 63,000 of those 71,000 importers would be exempted since their volumes imported would be below the new mass-based de minimis of 50 tonnes per year. Approximately 8,000 of those 71,000 importers import more than 50 tonnes of mass per year and would therefore not be exempted. Among the 63,000 importers exempted, 74% of these importers are small or medium companies as defined by ORBIS: 40% are small companies, 34% are medium companies.\n2.3.2 Estimated cost savings for public authorities in Member States\nIn terms of implementation and enforcement, CBAM affects both the NCAs for CBAM (e.g., authorisation of declarants, review of CBAM declarations, sale and repurchase of CBAM certificates) and Customs Authorities (e.g., review of customs declarations, border controls).\nThe 2021 impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal estimated that implementation and enforcement costs for public authorities would be EUR 481 per year per importer under the situation where default value for emissions are used, and EUR 7,985 per importer under the situation with actual values for emissions. 3 year per\n3° See Impact Assessment Report of 14.7.2021 (SWD(2021) 643 final), Part 2, Table 6-5.\n15\nSince exempted importers under the simplification proposal are largely small importers, the Commission assumes that they would choose to report emissions based on default values. Therefore, the implementation and enforcement cost savings for public authorities would be approximately EUR 87,542,000 per year’.\n2.3.3 Estimated revenue losses due to the new de minimis threshold\nThe 2021 impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal estimated that the revenue from CBAM would be approximately EUR 2.1 billion in 2030.*? Since less than 1% of emissions would not be captured under the new de minimis threshold (see Table 1), the foregone implied revenue for the year 2030 due to emissions not captured is estimated at approximately EUR 21,000,000.\n2.3.4 Estimated net benefits from the reduction of administrative burden\nTable 3 below provides the aggregated costs savings and loss of revenue due to the proposed new de minimis threshold of an annual 50 tonnes of mass per importer. Overall, the proposed new de minimis annual threshold would lead to cumulative cost savings of EUR 1,210 million, a limited loss of revenue (EUR 21 million), and an overall net benefit of EUR 1,189 million.\nTable 3.

Simplifying CBAM for large CBAM importers\nIn addition to the de minimis exemption, a number of simplifications will be introduced that will benefit importers that will remain within the scope of CBAM, or operators in third countries. These measures can be grouped in four categories depending on whether they aim at simplifying (i) authorisation of declarants, (ii) emission calculation, (iii) reporting requirements, or (iv) financial liability.\nIt should be noted that due to limited data availability, it is difficult to quantify the impact of the measures presented in this section in terms of reduction of administrative costs.*> Where possible, Commission services attempted to provide an illustration of the order of magnitude, or else describe qualitatively, how the measure will contribute to simplifying and strengthening the CBAM, while safeguarding its environmental objective.\nSeparate from this simplification proposal, the Commission clarified, in a letter to stakeholders on 19 December 2024, that CBAM does not apply to electricity generated in the exclusive economic zone of Member States and imported into the customs territory of the Union.*4 This means that there is no obligation for importers, regarding such electricity imports, to apply for the status of authorised CBAM declarant, to access the CBAM Registry, or to pay a CBAM adjustment.\n3.1 Measures to simplify the authorisation of declarants\n3.1.1 Authorisation procedure\n3.1.1.1 Problem definition\nMember States and stakeholders have expressed concerns about the administrative burden in relation to the procedure to grant importers the status of authorised CBAM declarant, which may consequently hinder the importation of CBAM goods. Concerns are raised in particular with respect to the mandatory consultation procedure.\nSecondly, importers have complained about the need to seek technical expertise for the submission of CBAM declarations and the assessment of CBAM obligations. Currently, only indirect customs representatives can assume legal liability for the CBAM declaration covering goods of an importer, but these representatives may not have the necessary expertise to carry out this task. Further, costs for contracting indirect customs representatives can be high and their capacity limited.\n33 None of the costs and benefits of the presented in Section 3 included in the estimates presented in section 2.3, measures are meaning that the additional administrative cost savings of measures presented in Section 3 will come on top. While a quantitative assessment of their impact was not possible at this stage, Commission Services will strive to assess their impact in the future, including where possible also quantitatively, for example in the biennial CBAM review reports as per Article 30 of the CBAM regulation.\n34 This is due to the fact that, in line with Articles 59 and 60 of the Union Customs Code (UCC), and by analogy to Article 31(h) of the UCC—Delegated Act, electricity generated by installations in the EEZ of the costal Member State has an “EU origin”, meaning that such electricity is not “originating in a third country” (as required by Art. 2 of the CBAM Regulation). Hence, it is not in the scope of the CBAM rules.\n17\n3.1.1.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is important to simplify the processing of applications for authorisation and reduce the associated administrative burden for Member States and the Commission.\nOptional consultation procedure\nAs the CBAM authorisation is valid in all MS and importers may have cross-border activity, the consultation procedure should still be part of the CBAM authorisation procedure: it will provide NCAs the possibility to monitor and control the information submitted to other NCAs. However, it should be for the NCA taking the authorisation decision to decide whether there is a need to launch a targeted consultation with other NCAs and/or the Commission. In light of the unnecessary obligation imposed on NCAs that would result in an excessive administrative burden, it is proposed to make the consultation procedure optional and no longer compulsory.\nIntroduction of a CBAM representative\nSince authorised CBAM declarants may not be qualified or have the operational capacity to fulfil the obligations related to the submission of a correct CBAM declaration, including the calculation of the embedded emissions, they could delegate the access and the right to submit a CBAM declaration to a third party e.g. consultants and/or environmental experts. The representative would not apply for authorisation; however the representative shall fulfil certain criteria to obtain access to the CBAM registry, (e.g. be holder of an EORI number, established in a Member State), and shall follow procedures, which will be established in an implementing act. Authorised CBAM declarants will remain liable for all CBAM obligations including the purchase and surrender of the correct number of CBAM certificates, however the basis of the calculation will be done by the trusted third party. To implement this, the Commission will need an empowerment to set up the technical solutions for the access management in the CBAM registry.\n3.1.1.3 Impact and simplification\nWhile the new CBAM de minimis will reduce administrative costs related to the authorisation procedures drastically, by decreasing the number of requests from around 200,000 to around 20,000, the proposed measures will further simplify the authorisation process. This will allow for a more efficient authorisation process, and reduce administrative costs for both NCAs and the Commission. The dedicated and targeted process provides the possibility to focus and control on those applicants which have a higher risk profile. In turn, this will allow declarants to obtain the status of ‘authorised CBAM declarants’ in due time and start importing CBAM goods as soon as possible.\nIn addition, the simplified authorisation procedure will — in particular for the SMEs that remain in scope even after the introduction of a new de minimis — smoothen the application process. Finally, creating a formal role of ‘CBAM representative’ to support the submission of CBAM declaration is expected to reduce the associated administrative burden for importers.\n18\n3.2 Measures to simplify emissions calculation\n3.2.1 Exclusion of non-calcined clay\n3.2.1.1 Problem definition\nThe CBAM scope includes ‘Other kaolinic clays’ (CN code 2507 00 80) in the list of cement goods. While calcined clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non- calcined clays. However, both types of clays are in, as the CN code does not differentiate between these two types of clays. Calcined clays can be used to (partly) replace clinker in cement, while non-calcined clays are one of the main raw materials used for the manufacturing of ceramics, an industry sector that is currently not covered by the CBAM scope.\n3.2.1.2 Proposed way forward\nThe inclusion of non-calcined clays in scope of CBAM is neither in line with the CBAM objective to target emission-intensive goods nor in line with the scope of the EU ETS.\nDuring the CBAM transitional period, the reporting obligation also applies to non-calcined clays, which represents an unnecessary administrative burden. As a partial relief, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773*> already provides simplification, as embedded emissions for non-calcined clays have been set to zero without the need to calculate the embedded emissions.\nBased on the above it is proposed to remove the non-calcined kaolinic clays from the CBAM scope.\n3.2.1.3 Impact and simplification\nThe exclusion of non-calcined clays from the CBAM scope would reduce the administrative burden from importers of this low-emission good, while having a very limited revenue impact as non-calcined clays are not carbon-intensive and are thus less relevant for carbon leakage risks. Based on available customs data, approximately 385 EU importers imported “other kaolinic clays” (under CN code 2507 00 80) in the period Oct 2023-Sept 2024. Given that currently CN code 2507 00 80 on ‘Other kaolinic clays’ does not distinguish between calcinated and non-calcinated clays, there exist no data on trade volumes that differentiate between the two types of those clays, which would allow us to make a confident estimate of the number of importers affected by this simplification. Cost savings from those exempted from CBAM that imported non-calcined clays cannot be further quantified at this stage.\n3.2.2 Default values\n3.2.2.1 Conditions to use default values\n3.2.2.1.1 Problem definition\nArt. 7(7)(a) empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts on the methodology to “specify the conditions under which it is deemed that actual emissions cannot be adequately determined”. This means that the Commission would need to set conditions, consequently importers would need to provide evidence why actual emissions cannot be determined, and\n35 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards reporting obligations for the purposes of the carbon border adjustment mechanism during the transitional period\n19\nthe Commission (and potentially also MS) would have to assess this evidence. However, this would run counter to the simplification objective. Moreover, CBAM implementation so far has relied on the assumption that importers would be able to choose freely between reporting actual emission data or default values made available by the Commission. This is for example evidenced by the fact that the current provisions on the content of CBAM declarations do not require a justification why actual emissions cannot be determined.\n3.2.2.1.2 Proposed way forward\nThe cycle of conditions, evidence and Commission/NCA assessment should be avoided.\nIt is therefore proposed to remove the requirement in Art. 7(7)(a) to “specify conditions when actual emissions cannot be adequately determined.”\n3.2.2.1.3. Impact and simplification\nDeclarants would be allowed to freely choose between actual embedded emissions and default values with a mark-up. This avoids a cycle where the Commission would have to set criteria when actual emissions cannot be determined, where declarants would have to provide evidence (potentially requiring the participation of operators in third countries) and where the Commission and MS NCAs would have to assess the evidence.\nThis does not weaken the protection against the risk of carbon leakage, which will be ensured by setting default values and proportionately designed mark-ups at appropriate levels to safeguard the environmental integrity of the CBAM, as required by the CBAM Regulation.\n3.2.2.2 Data collection challenges\n3.2.2.2.1 Problem definition\nAnnex IV, Section 4 specifies that “The Commission shall publish guidance for the approach taken to correct for waste gases or greenhouse gases used as process input, before collecting the data required to determine the relevant default values for each type of goods listed in Annex I. ...”. The approach that has been taken so far is to use publicly available databases of international institutions (such as the International Energy Agency) and of international industry sector associations (such as the World Steel Association or the Global Cement and Concrete Association). These databases are publicly available (although sometimes behind a paywall), rely on a consistent approach across installations/countries, are often based on actual data and are peer-reviewed. Collecting actual values from individual installations poses several challenges:\n- Contrary to the EU ETS, there is no obligation on operators in third countries to provide such information, which is often considered business-sensitive. Even if individual installations provide actual data, there is currently no verification mechanism in place. Such data may differ in terms of the underlying methodology.\nTherefore, the Commission has not embarked on an exercise to collect data from individual installations and consequently no guidance has been published.\n3.2.2.2.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is proposed to revise the Annex IV, Section 4 concerning the determination of default values to match an approach that is technically feasible. The core principles of using actual and best available data should be kept.\n20\n3.2.2.2.3. Impact and simplification\nAs there would be no data collection from individual installations in third countries, the publication of a Commission guidance document on how to collect data would no longer be necessary. The Commission will instead rely on best available data (i.e. reliable data from publicly available sources), as specified in the CBAM Regulation.\n3.2.2.3 Alternative default values based on worst EU ETS installations 3.2.2.3.1 Problem definition\nAnnex IV, Section 4.1 specifies that default values shall be set at the average emission intensity of each exporting country and for each of the goods under the CBAM scope, increased by a proportionately designed mark-up. When reliable data for the exporting country cannot be applied for a type of goods, then Section 4.1 provides for an alternative approach of setting default values which is based on the average emission intensity of the X% worst performing EU ETS installations for that type of goods.\nThe problem with this alternative approach is that even though the most relevant processes are covered by the EU-ETS, and emissions intensity data are available for those, this is not the case for some processes and goods.\n3.2.2.3.2 Proposed way forward\nThe EU ETS products benchmarks cover only 11 products that are relevant for CBAM, while the CBAM scope encompasses 569 different CN codes. The ETS benchmarks cover the most greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive production steps, but not the downstream processes, so estimations would be necessary for the latter. Some CBAM goods are not covered by any product benchmark (e.g. ferro-alloys, aluminous cement). Moreover, some CBAM goods are produced by very few installations in the EU, which would make it impossible to determine for example the worst 1% or 10%. Finally, in some cases the worst EU producers are still more GHG-efficient than most of their competitors in third countries (e.g. for nitric acid). Therefore, it is necessary to define a simpler approach to determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country cannot be applied for a type of goods.\nIt is proposed to set the alternative default value at the level of the average emission intensity of the ten countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data are available. This would provide a strong carbon leakage risk protection, while not being overly punitive. It would also ensure that the absence of data does not result in a more favourable treatment compared to countries where data are available. The possibility also exists for declarants to demonstrate that default values based on region-specific features should be lower, pursuant to point 7 of Annex IV to the CBAM Regulation.\n3.2.2.3.3 Simplification and impact\nIn the absence of data for some countries, the derivation of alternative default values based on the worst EU installations can be simplified by just using the average of the ten highest default values of those countries for which reliable data are available. This is a much simpler, more practical and understandable approach for importers. It strengthens the protection against the risk of carbon leakage when importers use default values, while not being overly punitive in cases where importers are not able to obtain actual emission data.\n3.2.3 Emission calculation for downstream processing\n3.2.3.1 Problem definition\nThe embedded emissions of some aluminium and steel goods currently in the scope of CBAM are primarily determined by the embedded emissions of input materials. In other words, most\n21\nembedded emissions are stemming from the production of their precursors while the emissions arising during the production steps of these goods are typically relatively low. In addition, these production processes are largely not covered by the EU ETS*®. They consist of finishing processes that are carried out by separate installations not covered by the EU ETS (except in the case of integrated facilities). At the moment, the CBAM reporting requires monitoring and reporting of the emissions of these finishing processes, as well as those stemming from the production of their precursors.\n3.2.3.2 Proposed way forward\nTo reduce the burden on operators in third countries from the additional monitoring of emissions of the final production steps — the latter typically not covered by EU ETS — it is proposed to exclude those manufacturing processes from the boundaries of the calculation of emissions for these aluminium and steel goods.\nSuch an exclusion would simplify substantially the monitoring and calculation efforts for those products. The simplification would improve the application of the CBAM methodology notably for complex goods, which is a precondition for the future potential expansion of the scope of CBAM to more downstream goods. Moreover, the simplification will have a positive impact on the manufacturers of those goods as they will be exempted from the obligation to monitor and report emissions happening at their own installation. The only data needed to calculate the embedded emissions of the final CBAM good would be the embedded emissions in the precursors purchased from external providers and the quantity of precursors needed per tonne of final CBAM good produced.\n3.2.3.3 Impact and simplification\nThe exclusion better focuses the CBAM methodology and its boundaries on GHG-intensive processes and better aligns the CBAM and ETS scopes, since the final processes of the metal manufacturing sectors are not under the EU ETS. Furthermore, the excluded emissions represent a very small share of total emissions.\nInternationally available data constrain the possibility to derive robust estimates of the impact, since publicly available data are not consistent in the attribution of emissions in different processes. Nevertheless, based on JRC IDEES data, in the EU such finalization processes would correspond to about 6% of embedded energy consumption in the case of an integrated route. This range is of a similar dimension to the range observed for a very specific CBAM product (using international available data). Specifically for CN Code 73181600, the share of embedded emissions corresponding to finalization processes varies around 4% when produced by the integrated route — although differences can be high between countries (depending on how they report emissions) and production routes.\n3.2.4 Exemption of precursors produced in the EU\n3.2.4.1 Problem definition\nAt the moment, precursors (i.e. CBAM goods used as input materials into the production of other CBAM goods) produced in the EU, which are exported to third countries for the production of CBAM goods, must be accounted for in the determination of the embedded\n36 One example of this problem relates to the production of CN codes under HS 7318 (screws, bolts, nuts, etc.), whereby input materials into these products (e.g. steel rod wires) undergo manufacturing processes to produce the final goods. In the EU, these processes (e.g. cutting and forging etc.) are usually carried out by installations outside the scope of EU ETS and typically account for a very small share of the emissions.\n22\nemissions of CBAM goods when imported into the EU. Under the current rules, these emissions have to be reported, the ETS carbon price has to be paid by EU producers, and these amounts have to be fully deducted from the CBAM financial adjustment.\nFor example, under the current systems, a third-country producer that exports mixed fertilisers to the EU and sources their input materials (ammonia and urea) from an EU-based installation covered under the EU ETS, would need to obtain information on embedded emissions of the ammonia and urea to add them to their overall calculation of embedded emissions of the mixed fertilisers. Then, the corresponding ETS carbon price, which had already been paid the EU producer, would be fully deducted from the calculation of their CBAM obligations to avoid double-counting.\n3.2.4.2 Proposed way forward\nThe inclusion of precursors adds a reporting and compliance burden without any added value from an environmental (as emissions embedded in precursors are covered by the EU ETS and the ETS carbon price deducted from the CBAM financial adjustment).\nIt is therefore proposed to attribute zero embedded emissions to the precursors produced in the EU (or in countries or territories excluded from CBAM pursuant to Annex III of the CBAM Regulation) which are already covered by the EU ETS and for which a carbon price has thus already paid under the EU ETS in the calculation of specific embedded emissions of CBAM goods. The volumes and origins of those precursors would remain part of the monitoring of the installation for verification purposes.\n3.2.4.3 Impact and simplification\nThe solution would include less precursors for which data collection is needed thus eliminating an administrative burden for EU importers and operators in third countries, without affecting the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered. This simplification would therefore not reduce the environmental effectiveness of the CBAM or subsequent CBAM revenue while eliminating transaction costs along the value chain. The proposed solution is not expected to generate new or additional circumvention risks. As indicated above the volumes and origins of the precursors continue to be monitored by the operator for verification purposes.\n3.2.5 Emission verification\n3.2.5.1 Problem definition\nCBAM declarants must submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values provided by the Commission or actual values calculated by third-country installations.\nCurrently, the CBAM Regulation requires verification of all embedded emissions, even if they are based on default values provided by the Commission. This is impractical and costly. There is no added value to ask CBAM declarants to ensure that these default values are verified by an accredited verifier.\n3.2.5.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is proposed to remove the verification of embedded emissions based on default values provided by the Commission for the reasons highlighted below:\ne Such verification does not provide a clear added value if default values are used. Embedded emissions based on default values will be calculated automatically in the\n23\nCBAM Registry on the basis of the quantities of imported CBAM goods declared (and cross-checked with national customs data). Verification of default values is redundant. For actual values, the accredited verifier, in principle, visits the installation and provides reasonable assurance that the methodology for the calculation of emissions (and its underlying assumptions) is correct. For default values, no visit to the premises of the installation would be relevant. The accredited verifier could verify the content of the CBAM declaration but there would be no added value in doing this (see point above). This would come at a cost for the declarant, and the lack of readily available accredited verifiers could make the verification difficult to obtain in practice.\n3.2.5.3 Impact and simplification\nRemoving this requirement (i.e. requirement to verify the emissions when they are based on default values) comes with no disadvantage. It would facilitate the use of default values for importers and reduce their cost, including the associated administrative constraints. This would also help third country producers, particularly SMEs, who could rely on using default values.\n3.2.6 Exclusion of indirect emissions of electricity\n3.2.6.1 Problem definition\nAnnex II to the Regulation lists the goods for which only direct emissions have to be taken into account for the purpose of CBAM. The Annex includes goods in the iron and steel, aluminium, and chemical sectors. For goods not listed in this Annex, both direct and indirec 137 emissions have to be taken into account for CBAM purposes. This is thus the case for goods in the cement and fertilisers sectors**, but also electricity based on the current text of Annex II. While the Regulation does not explicitly mention that indirect emissions of electricity are not relevant for CBAM, it is implied.\nThis emerges from the following elements.\nRecital 19 of the Regulation appears to imply that when the Regulation was drafted the goods listed in Annex II were intended to be only those which are eligible for indirect cost compensation: “cc Indirect emissions should, however, be taken into initially for ... not account the goods in respect of which financial measures apply in the Union that compensate for indirect emissions costs incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices. Those goods are identified in Annex II to this Regulation....” Electricity production is not eligible for indirect cost compensation*’.\nAnnex III, Section D.2 of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 laying down “Rules for determining the emission factor of electricity as imported goods” reads: “For determining the specific actual embedded emissions of electricity as imported goods,\n37 “Indirect emissions” defined the emissions from the production of electricity which is consumed during the are as production processes of goods.\n38 Agglomerated iron ores (CN 2601 12 00) constitute an exception. These goods are refined products from mining activities that are used as input for iron and steel manufacturing. In CBAM, they are listed under the iron and steel sector heading. However, these products are not eligible for indirect cost compensation and both direct and indirect emissions are taken into account for CBAM.\n39 Communication from the Commission: Guidelines on certain State aid measures in the context of the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading post-2021 (2020/C 317/04). OJ C 317, 25.9.2020, p. 5-19.\n24\nonly direct emissions shall be applicable in accordance with Section 2 of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956”. The fact that only direct emissions of electricity are to be considered under CBAM has therefore been made clear since August 2023, when the Implementing Regulation was adopted.\nOn substance, indirect emissions are not really relevant for electricity as a CBAM good, as in this case the CBAM concerns installations producing electricity, not consuming it. The auto- consumption of electricity by power plants (e.g. electricity consumed by auxiliary equipment such as fans, pumps, flue-gas treatment systems, air conditioning, and lighting) can be taken into account by subtracting it from the gross electricity generation to result in the net electricity generation. Indeed, Annex III, Section D.3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 addresses the auto-consumption of electricity in installations producing electricity: “For the production of electricity, the activity level shall refer to net electricity leaving the system boundaries of the power plant or cogeneration unit, after subtraction of internally consumed electricity.”\nHowever, as long as this is not clarified expressly in the basic act, some confusion may remain as to whether only direct emissions of electricity have to be accounted for under CBAM may remain, unless both the Regulation and its implementing act(s) are considered simultaneously.\n3.2.6.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is proposed to amend Annex II of the Regulation.\n3.2.6.3 Simplification\nThe proposed amendment, by making the CBAM rules easier to understand, reduces the time and thus costs incurred by importers and operators when familiarising with the system. Moreover, it avoids any ambiguity as to what would otherwise constitute an additional layer of complexity of the system, i.e. reporting of indirect emissions of electricity in addition to the direct emissions,\n3.3. Measures to simplify CBAM reporting requirements\n3.3.1 Change of the deadline to submit annual CBAM declarations\n3.3.1.1 Problem definition\nThe annual deadline for declarants to both submit their annual CBAM declaration (including a verification report if actual values are used) and surrender the corresponding number of certificates is set on 31 May. However, this deadline may prove to be challenging for many declarants, especially for the first reporting years. It might constrain recourse to actual values.\nIn addition, the corresponding ETS annual deadlines have been shifted from 30 April to 30 September.\n3.3.1.2 Proposed way forward\nMoving the annual deadline for declarants to submit their declaration and surrender certificates to a later date each year would match the recent postponement of the EU ETS annual deadlines. It would in turn require changes to the two other CBAM annual deadlines which inherently follow the declaration and certificate surrender: certificate repurchase 1 month later than certificate surrender and certificate cancellation on the day after the last day of the repurchase period. It is proposed to set the annual deadline for declaration submission\n25\nand certificate surrender on 31 August, with the repurchase deadline moved to 30 September and the certificate cancellation precise date on 1 October.*° Once the Own Resources proposal is adopted, the Commission will evaluate a potential review of the calendar for declarations in the CBAM cycle.\n3.3.1.3 Impact and simplification\nThis would give each year (i) non-EU operators more time to verify their emissions and (ii)\ndeclarants to submit their annual CBAM declaration buy and surrender the corresponding\ncertificates. No detrimental effects are expected.\n3.3.2 CBAM Registry access for operators and verifiers\nTwo possible simplifications were identified. One relates to improving access for third- country operators to the CBAM Registry and the second one relates to creating an access to the CBAM Registry to accredited verifiers.\n3.3.2a Registration of third-country operators in the CBAM Registry\n3.3.2.1 Problem definition — part a\nProblem 1:\nArticles 10 and 14 of the CBAM Regulation, containing provisions on the Operators’ Portal, are currently unclear in several aspects, including the scope of the information to be made available to the public or the possibility to upload information on the carbon price effectively paid. Further, it is unclear whether the controlling entity of operator of the installation in the third country, including the parent company, falls under the definition of “operator”. Such uncertainty complicates implementation.\nProblem 2:\nInitial data submissions in EU Access (through which operators can access the CBAM registry) have revealed substantial data quality challenges in the registration of non-EU established companies, especially in relation with their basic identity verification. Initial data submissions have proven to contain a substantial share (up to 50%) of low-quality input data with erroneous company names, dummy or incorrect identifiers or/and missing sources of cross-check information. For these cases, Commission staff needs to either reject the request or/and follow up bilaterally. Rejection of requests creates additional work for the operator as well as for the Commission services who need to re-evaluate at a later stage. The problem is expected to grow as circa 55.000 registrations are expected.\n3.3.2.2 Proposed way forward and simplification — part a\nProblem 1:\nIt should be clarified that controlling entities are covered by the definition of operator. Those entities would be allowed to access the operators’ portal and to upload the calculation of emissions and verification reports of the installations of all its subsidiaries and entities they control at once. This will simplify implementation for operators.\n40 As part of the biennal review reports from 2027 onwards, Commission services will if the deadline asssess can be advanced to an earlier date of the year, once the system is more mature and operators are fully familiar with all procedures.\n26\nRelatedly, it should be required for a company to provide information on its ultimate controlling entity, if applicable. This will facilitate the review of CBAM declarations and the risk assessment operations by the Commission.\nFurther, it should be clearly stated that the operator who chooses to share data with the declarant can also indicate — in the operators’ portal - the carbon price paid in a third country. This will simplify reporting obligations.\nLastly, Article 14 should be complemented by clarifying that the operator can also choose to keep the location of installations confidential.\nProblem 2:\nIt should be made mandatory to submit a corporate identifier upon registration of a third country operator in the CBAM registry. This will allow to transfer the corporate identifier used in EU Access to the CBAM registry. The choice of a specific identifier could be determined through an amendment of the Implementing Regulation on the CBAM registry.\n3.3.2b Granting access to accredited verifiers to the CBAM Registry\n3.3.2.3 Problem definition — part b\nCurrently, the CBAM Regulation does not provide for the possibility to grant access to accredited verifiers to the CBAM registry. This creates complications relating to the process of submitting and reviewing CBAM verification report.\n3.3.2.4 Proposed way forward — part\nIt is proposed to amend the CBAM Regulation to provide for the registration of accredited verifiers in the CBAM registry.\n3.3.2.5. Impact and simplification — part b\nThe proposal to grant access to verifiers to the CBAM Registry would align with the practice under the EU ETS, provide simplifications and alleviate the burden for several constituencies of stakeholders. It would facilitate the declarant’s compliance with reporting obligations since the reliability of emissions data will increase significantly. However, this comes at a cost for the Commission and NCAs relating to the expansion of the operator’s portal and the registration of verifiers in the CBAM Registry.\nIn more details, the advantages and impacts of simplifications are described below:\ne It would create a more secure system for CBAM declarants, thus avoiding the potential application of penalties. Granting accredited verifiers access to the CBAM Registry would eliminate the risk that the operator submits an invalid verification report e.g. because the verifier was not accredited for the correct scope of accreditation, or the verification report is not based on the latest calculation of embedded emissions. It would simplify the review of verification reports for Commission and NCAs because the integrity and authenticity of the data would not need to be checked manually. If the verification report is not uploaded by the accredited verifier, then these checks would likely need to be carried out manually by the Commission and NCAs. It would allow verifiers to update information on accreditation directly in the CBAM Registry, rather than having the NCAs do this update manually each time\n27\nan accredited verifier renews or updates the accreditation certificate, or an administrative sanction is taken by the national accreditation body. It would simplify the verification of embedded emissions for third-country operators. Operators could simply select the accredited verifier in the CBAM Registry to ‘request verification’ instead of sharing sensitive information outside the CBAM Registry by way of electronically signed and encrypted emails exchanges containing the calculation of embedded emissions, request for information and preliminary assessments from the verifier, etc. In case of an issue with the verification report, the Commission or NCAs would otherwise need to ask for a copy of the relevant exchanges to find evidence on whether a mistake emanates from the accredited verifier or the operator.\nOn the other hand, the integration of accredited verifiers in the CBAM registry also creates constraints for the Commission and NCA:\n- A new population of users would be added to the CBAM registry, specifically to the portal for third-country operators. Some IT development is required. The IT registration of accredited verifiers would need to be managed by the Commission through EU Access, then the management of the registration information would be managed by NCAs, in coordination with national accreditation bodies.\n3.4 Measures to simplify the CBAM financial liability\n3.4.1 CBAM certificate management\n3.4.1.1 Problem definition\nUnder the current CBAM regulation, declarants will face two obligations:\n- they will have to buy CBAM certificates to ensure that, at the end of each quarter, they own a number of certificates which corresponds to at least 80%, calculated based on default values, of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year (hereafter the “80% rule”’); the number of certificates eligible for repurchase by NCAs will be limited to one third of the total number of CBAM certificates purchased by the authorised CBAM declarant during the previous calendar year (even if the purchase year is different).\nThe “80% rule” prevents risks and fraudulent patterns, by ensuring that the CBAM financial obligation is partly applied shortly after the import takes place, on a quarterly basis, instead of waiting until the time of the declaration during the following year for the surrendering of CBAM certificates. However, the combination of these two rules will likely lead many declarants to buy many more certificates than what they will need to surrender, resulting in a disproportionate financial burden, potentially without the possibility to have them repurchased by NCAs.\n3.4.1.2 Proposed way forward\nIn defining the best way forward, it is important to strike a balance between the initial policy objective of this rule and the burden it entails for importers. Based on the problem description, and as assessed in the examples below, notably the assessment on liquidity, it has become apparent that the imposed financial burden is unnecessarily high. At the same time, to maintain effectiveness of the rule, it should still represent a relevant security compared to the ultimate financial obligation.\n28\nMore specifically, it is proposed to lower the percentage from 80% to 50% to become a better proxy to declarants’ expected financial liability, while keeping the way the calculation is made every quarter based on information received from customs authorities on the quantity of goods imported by declarants since the beginning of the year. The level of 50% is chosen to reduce the burden on declarants, while maintaining effectiveness of the as a control and safeguard measure against compliance risks. Therefore, moving to 50% appears to be a balanced choice between the two objectives.\nSecond, the calculation base would be changed, and declarants would be given the choice between 2 options on which the calculation will be made:\n- Option 1: Use public default values with a deduction of the mark-up*! and of the corresponding free allocation*”. - Option 2: Use the number of CBAM certificates that they surrendered in the previous year for the same goods.\nFor both methods, the Commission will make all information and calculations available to declarants in the CBAM registry to facilitate both compliance by declarants and enforcement by NCAs. In practice, it means that declarants will access the registry and manage their financial liability directly in the registry, at least every quarter. They will also be made aware if they must purchase certificates.\nThird, the one-third repurchase limit would:\n(i) be replaced by the number of certificates that declarants will be required to buy as a result of the rule (i.e. all certificates which the Regulation forced a declarant to buy can be sold back), and (ii) apply to the same year as the year of purchase (instead of the year before as currently provided for).\n3.4.1.3 Impact and simplification\nThe measure will greatly simplify the way declarants manage their CBAM liability and ease the financial and administrative burden. In addition, it would avoid over-purchase of CBAM certificates which, in some cases, cannot be sold back and would be lost even if declarants were legally forced to buy them. It will therefore also avoid legal challenges and disputes which would otherwise result from the current repurchase limit.\nIllustrative example of the impact on an individual importer\nThe below calculations are primarily based on Option 1. Suppose that on 1 January 2030, an importer buys 600t of steel from a foreign supplier which (using default values) has an embedded 1000t CO2 equivalent. Suppose that in 2030 the full CBAM price is EUR 85/t CO2 and the effective price (i.e., considering the corresponding CBAM factor) of CBAM certificates is EUR 50/t CO2 and the carbon price paid abroad for this steel is EUR 40/t CO2. This importer does not import any other CBAM goods during 2030.\n41 To incentivise reporting of actual values, Commission default values apply mark-up. An implementing act will further a define the level of the mark-up.\n* The CBAM is implemented gradually in parallel to the phase-out of free allowances under the EU ETS.\n29\nThe actual CBAM obligation at the end of the year (2030) is EUR 10,000 (1000 times [EUR 50- EUR40]). This should be compared to the financial obligations throughout the year using the 80% rule and the 50% rule.\nUnder the 80% rule, currently in place, before 31 March 2030, the importer needs to purchase 800 CBAM certificates (80% of 1000) at the full CBAM price of EUR 85/t CO2, and hence set aside, until then end of 2030, EUR 68,000. At the end of the year, 200 CBAM certificates need to be surrendered (10,000 EUR divided by the effective carbon price of EUR 50 per tonne CO2 eq.), and one third of 600 certificates can be repurchased, while 400 certificates can be carried over to 2031. If the importer does not import CBAM goods in 2031, then it can only repurchase 134 (one third of the 400 certificates carried over from 2030) and hence loses the value of 266 CBAM certificates (at EUR 85 each), corresponding to a value of EUR 22,610.\nUnder the proposed 50% rule, before 31 March 2030, the importer would need to purchase 500 CBAM certificates (50% of 1000) at the effective price of per certificate, and hence set aside, until then end of 2030, EUR 25,000. At the end of the year, 200 CBAM certificates need to be surrendered and the rest, 300, can be repurchased. There is no longer a risk of losing the value of a purchased CBAM certificate.\nThe risk of excess purchase of CBAM certificates that cannot be repurchased by NCAs will be exacerbated for imports from countries with comparable levels of carbon pricing (e.g. imports from the UK) and for low-carbon goods (e.g. which are substantially lower than default values). This will be addressed by Option 2.\nEstimated freed-up Liquidity\nUnder the 50% rule importers will need to front-load the purchase of fewer CBAM certificates throughout the year, compared to the 80% rule. This will free up financial resources for these companies during the year. The 2021 impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal estimated that the revenue from CBAM would be approximately EUR 2,100 million in 2030.¥\nExample based on Option 1: Under the 80% rule this means setting aside EUR 714 million by the end of Q1 and similarly for Q2, Q3 and Q4, assuming that imports are distributed equally over all quarters.\nUnder the 50% rule this means setting aside EUR 262.5 million by the end of each quarter. Hence, on a quarterly basis 451.5 million in liquidity is freed up under the 50% rule compared with the 80% rule (1,806 million in total), with positive liquidity effects for importers.\nThe effect will even be starker when taking account of importers sourcing their goods from the UK or other countries with a high carbon price, choosing Option 2.\n3.4.2 Certificate sales start date in 2027\n3.4.2.1 Problem definition\nMember States should start selling CBAM certificates to their declarants on the common central platform (CCP) from 1 January 2026 onwards. In addition, as discussed above, the\n4 See Impact Assessment Report of 14.7.2021 (SWD(2021) 643 final).\n30\nCBAM Regulation obliges declarants as from 2026 to have a number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry which currently corresponds at the end of each quarter to at least 80% of the embedded emissions embedded in the goods they import since 1 January of the year.\nHowever, 2026 will be the first year of the CBAM financial adjustment with limited insight on key factors determining the number of certificates that many declarants will have to buy in 2026 and surrender in 2027 for the year 2026, mainly the level of carbon intensity of imported goods, the carbon prices which will be paid abroad and how they will be deducted. Besides, it is proposed to revise the “80% rule”. As a result, CBAM importers could be forced to start purchasing CBAM certificates already in Q1 2026 while this rule is being simplified by a legislative proposal.\n3.4.2.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is proposed to provide for a specific treatment for the first year of the CBAM financial adjustment. Declarants will be able to purchase CBAM certificates from February 2027 to cover the emissions embedded in the CBAM goods they will have imported during 2026. The calculation method for the certificate prices will not be affected, and certificates bought in a given week in 2027 to cover for 2026 emissions will reflect the applicable weekly ETS price as calculated by the Commission.\nThe sale start date should be postponed to February 1*' (instead of January 1*') to give more time for declarants to collect data and customs systems to feed relevant data on latest imports in 2026 into the CBAM registry. While shortening the time declarants will have to buy certificates covering all their imports since 1 January 2026, they would still have two months to buy certificates before the first application of the “50% rule” (currently “80% rule”) on Q1 2027 e.g. from 1.1.2027 to 31.3.2027. As CBAM declarants cannot acquire CBAM certificates in 2026, there is a need to determine the applicable EU ETS price for purchases of CBAM certificates in 2027 pertaining to emissions embedded in CBAM goods imported in 2026. For this purpose, the Commission will calculate the price of CBAM certificates based on the quarterly average of the closing prices of the EU ETS allowances of the quarter of importation o the CBAM goods to which those emissions correspond.\n3.4.2.3 Impact and simplification\nThis solution would greatly simplify how declarants have to manage their financial liability during the first year of the CBAM definitive regime. Combined with the revision of the “80% rule” (now 50% rule), it would address major concerns raised by stakeholders about financial risks resulting from the legal uncertainty related to how the CBAM financial adjustment will be calculated and applied already in 2026, as declarants will be required to start buying CBAM certificates for 2026 imports only at a time when they have enough clarity on the number of certificates they will have to surrender by 31 August 2027.\n3.4.3. Default values for carbon prices paid in third countries\n3.4.3.1 Problem definition\nUnder the CBAM regulation, the deduction of a carbon price effectively paid in a third country was designed to avoid double charging thereby promoting the uptake of carbon pricing in third countries.\nHowever, the CBAM regulation sets a comparatively high burden on the CBAM declarant for allowing a deduction of a carbon price paid in a third country. The CBAM declarant essentially will need to:\n31\na) obtain (on time) documentary evidence of an effective payment of a carbon price; b) demonstrate that the carbon price was paid on the emissions embedded in the CBAM goods and; c) have this evidence certified by a person that is independent from the declarant and from the authorities of the country of origin (hereafter: certifier).\nThe Commission will set the rules regarding these steps in an implementing act planned for adoption before the end of 2025, allowing for a reduction in the number of certificates to surrender. Applying the rules defined in the CBAM Regulation is expected to lead to a significant administrative burden for declarants, third-country installation operators, and the review authorities (European Commission and National Competent Authorities). In specific cases, such as electricity and indirect emissions, it is not clear whether claiming a carbon pricing deduction altogether would be feasible. It can also be expected that, due to the generally low effective carbon prices in third countries compared to the EU ETS prices, the calculation and certification costs associated with obtaining the deduction will outweigh the benefit of a lower CBAM financial adjustment**.\n3.4.3.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is proposed that the Commission may determine, where applicable, default carbon prices per country for the carbon price paid on average over a year (in EUR/tCO2ze). In such a case, any rebate or other form of compensation available in that country that would have resulted in a reduction of that default carbon price shall be taken into account. The possibility to claim a reduction based on certified evidence of an actual payment is maintained.\nThe default carbon prices would function similarly to default values for the calculation of embedded emissions: declarants would be given the possibility to choose either to rely on the Commission default carbon price, or to claim the deduction of the carbon price effectively paid (where no changes are made compared to the current CBAM Regulation).\nThe ‘best available information’ would evolve over consecutive compliance periods, on the basis of cooperation with the third country. Therefore, the default values for carbon prices paid in third countries would be periodically revised. Where insufficient information is available in a specific country, the Commission would set more conservative default values to incentivise the provision of reliable data, while taking into account the need to reasonably reflect the carbon price paid.\nThis option provides additional flexibility for the producer and declarant, while ensuring that the European Commission can develop a workable approach to the carbon price deduction.\n3.4.3.3 Impact and simplification\nThe proposed simplification primarily reduces the administrative burden on third-country operators to prove that a carbon price was effectively paid. Considering that the costs for this calculation and certification are largely fixed, many more small installations and installations that only export a small share of their production to the EU would become able to declare a\n44 The marginal carbon prices reported by carbon pricing data in most much lower than the EU ETS. sources are cases Specifically, as at 1 April 2024, the EU ETS price was EUR 57 per tonne of CO2e, whereas it was EUR 7 on average across the Chinese pilot emission trading systems and EUR 6 in Korea (World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard, https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/). In addition, many systems allocate a large share of emission allowances (permits) for free. For instance, 84% of industrial emission allowances under the emissions trading systems that were operational in 2021 were allocated free of charge (OECD, Effective Carbon Rates 2023, https://doi.org/10.1787/b84d5b36- en). As a result, the effective carbon price paid in CBAM sectors of third countries will often be very low.\n32\ncarbon price insofar as they are located in a country where an effective carbon pricing instrument applies with respect to CBAM goods. In turn, the deduction of the carbon price by CBAM declarants would become more widely accessible.\nIt would also reduce the administrative burden on Commission and NCAs to check compliance of CBAM declarations with evidence of the price effectively paid and certification requirements. However, significant analytical work would need to be carried out by the Commission to determine the values.\n3.4.4 Information exchanges on CBAM certificate cancellation\n3.4.4.1 Problem definition\nPursuant to Article 20(3) of the CBAM regulation, the information on the sale, repurchase and cancellation of CBAM certificates in the common central platform (CCP) should be transferred to the CBAM registry at the end of each working day.\nHowever, in practice this non-reciprocal information exchange from the CCP to the CBAM registry at the end of the day will not concern cancellation of certificates. This is because certificate cancellation is a task to be automatically performed by the Commission in the CBAM registry, and certificates are to be cancelled without any compensation to declarants. Additionally, since the cancellation does not relate to any payments made on the CCP, the platform will not hold information on cancellation of certificates and will not be able to send it to the CBAM registry.\n3.4.4.2 Proposed way forward\nIt is proposed to remove the reference to certificates cancellation from the reference to information exchange from the CCP to the CBAM registry.\n3.4.4.3 Simplification\nThis measure simplifies the information exchanges between the 2 platforms (CBAM registry and CCP).\n4. Stakeholder positions\nThroughout the transitional period, the Commission engaged with stakeholders, notably with industry and with national authorities as well as international partners and operators in third countries, with a view to getting their feedback and suggestions to improve the functioning of the mechanism. Several of the proposed simplifications are based on the input received. Moreover, on 6 February 2025 a Simplification Roundtable was held by the Commission with industry stakeholders to present the simplification package and collect feedback. EU industry participating was broadly supportive of the proposed simplifications.\nSpecifically, stakeholders expressed views on the following simplifications:\nNew CBAM De minimis: National authorities and businesses largely agree on the need for a new CBAM de minimis, which would be more effective in exempting occasional imports of small CBAM quantities. There is a broad consensus on the merit of alleviating the large majority occasional importers of small quantities of CBAM goods from a costly compliance burden. At least four Member States performed data analysis similar to the one by the Commission services. The distributions of importers of small quantities of CBAM goods\n33\nbased on national customs data confirmed the results of the analysis carried out by the Commission services.\nWhile there was agreement that embedded emissions are the most accurate metric to determine occasional importers of small CBAM quantities, many stakeholders (including Member States, industry representatives and NGOs/Think Tanks) called for the threshold to be expressed in mass, to facilitate application by importers. Such an approach is reflected in the proposed exemption. Some stakeholders (including Member States and industry representatives) expressed a preference for an annual threshold over a consignment-based threshold, given the inherent circumvention risks of a consignment-based threshold. Moreover, some stakeholders (including Member States and industry representatives) shared the assessment that an annual threshold is a more targeted solution, as it allows to exempt more importers with less foregone emissions. As it concerns the level of the threshold, opinions vary: Some stakeholders call for a higher threshold, some for a lower threshold, some agree with the level chosen.\nMany stakeholders have emphasised the importance of the introduction of a new de minimis threshold to be supplemented with anti-circumvention measures.\nMeasures to simplify the CBAM reporting requirements\nMany stakeholders, (including Member States and industry representatives, in particular in the aluminium sector) requested changes of the rules pertaining to CBAM precursors for which an EU ETS carbon price had already been paid. Equally, many stakeholders called for changes of the CBAM scope to mirror more precisely the EU ETS scope, by exempting marginal emissions of downstream processes. Stakeholders in the ceramics industry requested to exempt non-calcined kaolinic clays from the CBAM scope.\nMeasures to simplify CBAM financial liability\nMany stakeholders (including Member States and industry representatives) suggested modifying the 80% rule, notably to take account of the deduction of free allowances and find a better proxy to expected financial liability with a view to avoiding forced excess purchases by importers. There is broad consensus that this rule needs to be adapted. Some stakeholders suggested that rather than lowering the 80% rule, it may be better to work on limitations to selling back certificates.\nConditions to use default values\nMany stakeholders (including Member States and industry representatives) have emphasised that in order to avoid excessive bureaucratic burden for importers, the possibility for declarants to use default values is indispensable. Some stakeholders have even suggested eliminating the possibility to report actual emissions and rely exclusively on CN-code and country-specific default values for reporting specific embedded emissions under CBAM.\nEmission verification of default values\n34\nStakeholders have pointed out that in case default values for reporting specific embedded emissions in the CBAM declaration, verification of the specific embedded emissions would not be required.\nDefault carbon prices in third countries\nSome stakeholders expressed concern at the difficulties that deduction of carbon price paid in third countries would entail in the case of electricity imported from countries where it is traded anonymously. Introducing default values would address these concerns and avoid the risk of double carbon pricing.\n35"
